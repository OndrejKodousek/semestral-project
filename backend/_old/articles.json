        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose on Monday amid mixed news from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Nvidia will report its fourth quarter results on Feb. 26. The earnings report brings some risks with it. Add that to the fact that this is the first earnings season since 2022 that the Magnificent Seven companies have not reported a sales surprise. As Nvidia's own report looms, is Nvidia a buy or sell now?On Monday, Taiwan Semiconductor reported January sales of $8.93 billion, a 36% increase from the year-ago period. But for the full quarter, revenue is seen coming at the lower end of its guidance of $25 billion-$25.8 billion after an earthquake in January affected some of its facilities. Taiwan Semi reported no change to its full-year outlook. and stated it was \"making every effort to recover the lost production.\"In January, TSMC beat estimates for its fourth quarter and gave a strong outlook for AI-chip demand. The chip foundry plans to double its chip on wafer on substrate packaging product, required by Nvidia's most advanced chips, by the end of 2025. Analysts noted the Nvidia supplier had guided AI revenue to double this year, as demand continued to exceed supply.Meanwhile, Nvidia got much-needed support after a trio of Big Tech leaders showed they were unfazed by DeepSeek and disclosed plans to increase their spending on artificial intelligence technologies. Combined, their spending plans stand at $245 billion.On Thursday, Amazon (AMZN) indicated it planned to increase its spending by 27% or $105 billion  mostly on AI data centers. But that was topped by Alphabet (GOOGL) which plans to increase its spending by 57% for a total of $75 billion. Earlier, Meta Platforms (META) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg indicated data-center spending plans of $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025  a 59% increase at the midpoint.Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy noted that \"most AI compute has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future.\"However, Microsoft's (MSFT) spending on AI data centers is set to slow next year. Microsoft announced in December that the company was not \"chip-supply constrained.\" In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last year, Nvidia disclosed that one customer accounted for 13% of its fiscal first-quarter revenue. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri believed that the customer was Microsoft. Nvidia's price performance is beginning to improve. The relative strength line, which compares the stock with the S&P 500 index, is rising after it sank on Jan. 27, when Nvidia suffered the biggest one-day market cap loss for any public company on record. In terms of 12-month price performance, Nvidia has beaten 88% of other stocks in Investor's Business Daily's database.On Feb. 4, China retaliated against U.S. tariffs. China's tariffs go into effect Monday. China accounted for 12% of total Nvidia sales for the four quarters ended in October, according to The Wall Street Journal. However, when President Donald Trump's tariff plans for China, Canada and Mexico were first revealed in November, Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon noted that \"raw semiconductor\" imports by these countries were tiny and would not hurt Nvidia. The analyst did say the tariffs raise some concerns that there may be more broad-based action that could hurt the semiconductor industry and even leaders like Nvidia.Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein noted that the \"restrictions seem in line or less severe than anticipated.\" Piper Sandler analysts also stated there were fewer entities on the restriction list than expected.For now, China's tariffs target oil, coal, liquefied natural gas and agricultural machinery and will go into effect on Feb. 10. Notably, semiconductors and Nvidia chips were not on the list although export controls on some scarce minerals used in making chips came into effect.  Are These Magnificent Seven Stocks A Buy Now?\nAlphabet | Amazon | Apple | Meta | Microsoft | Nvidia | TeslaNvidia stock sank on Jan. 27 amid reports that the latest large-language model from Chinese AI lab DeepSeek came close to the performance of its American rivals at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek said its AI models cost $5.6 million to train compared with $100 million-$1 billion that Dario Amodei, CEO of privately held Anthropic, noted as the cost for U.S. companies last year.Nvidia shares then fell below the 50-day moving average in heavy volume  a sell signal. Nvidia is a top AI stock to watch despite the plunge. A company spokesperson noted that DeepSeek's AI model uses a Test Time Scaling method that relies on other widely available AI models and takes longer to come up with better answers. This method allowed the system to be in compliance with export restrictions, the Nvidia spokesperson said.Citi analyst Christopher Danely said that the model depends on cloud service providers and is evidence of \"continued strong growth in spending in AI.\" Meta's chief Zuckerberg noted it was too early to assess the impact of DeepSeek on AI spending.Meanwhile, according to The Wall Street Journal, DeepSeek's chatbot may be banned on government devices.In January, Trump announced a joint venture called Stargate involving OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL) and Japan-based SoftBank (SFTBY). Together, the companies will invest up to $500 billion in four years to build data centers and other infrastructure for AI applications. Nvidia will be a technology partner for the new venture.However, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk on Twitter/X cast some doubts on the project, saying: \"They don't actually have the money.\" Reports stated that SoftBank may invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI. Funds own 39% of Nvidia's shares outstanding, according to IBD MarketSurge. But going by its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E, funds aren't necessarily buying shares. The rating measures price and volume action over the last 13 weeks.On Jan. 15, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised concerns over manufacturing yields, which are limiting shipments of Nvidia's liquid-cooled rack systems containing Blackwell chips. The analyst cut the 2026 revenue target from Nvidia's data center business to $185 billion from $200 billion while maintaining an overweight rating and price target of 180.But HSBC analyst Lee Frank noted concerns over a \"supply chain overhang\" for Blackwell chips that could hurt Nvidia's ability to deliver another beat-and-raise quarter.The Biden administration issued new regulations on chip exports on Jan. 13. Apart from 18 countries, chip exports will be restricted to 50,000 per country.How Invested In The Stock Market Should You Be Right Now?Reports also stated that countries would need a license when orders exceed 1,700 advanced AI chips. The restrictions will impose control over how \"America's leading semiconductors, computers, systems, and even software are designed and marketed globally,\" Ned Finkle, Nvidia's vice president of government affairs, said in a statement.Similar to export curbs, a trade war fought with tariffs could hurt foreign sales of U.S. semiconductor companies to some countries.Ken Glueck, executive vice president at Oracle (ORCL), noted that the new rules could reduce the global chip market by 80% for U.S. chip companies, and that \"a rule of this consequence on that timetable will turn the U.S. cloud industry upside down.\"Analysts at UBS noted they expect results for the January-ended quarter and the outlook for the April-ending quarter to be strong. Yields for Blackwell have \"inflected higher,\" while Nvidia's product mix is shifting away from Hopper to its newer Blackwell.Analysts also see revenue streams increasing for the chip leader from original equipment manufacturers as they build inventory.Meanwhile, Taiwan-based Hon Hai plans to ship out the GB200 rack system that has Blackwell chips earlier than expected, UBS noted. Total revenue from Blackwell is seen hitting $9 billion in the January-ended quarter.UBS maintained a price target of 185 and a buy recommendation for Nvidia.On Jan. 6, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the \"ChatGPT moment for general robotics\" is near during the 2025 CES tech conference, but investors were eager for updates on Nvidia's Blackwell chip ramp-up and early indications for its next chip, Rubin. Nvidia's data center business is expected to generate $113 billion in revenue for the year that ends next January, according to FactSet  more than the total revenue estimate for any other chip company. That makes its other ventures a sideshow, some say.December was a challenging month for Nvidia investors. But the stock faced more headwinds in January.On Dec. 12, news that the Supreme Court had dismissed Nvidia's appeal in a securities fraud lawsuit by shareholders pressured the stock. The 2018 suit was triggered when Nvidia's revenue took a hit amid a crash in cryptocurrencies and sought to investigate how much of its sales depended on digital currency.Nvidia shares also fell after Broadcom's results showed strong demand for its AI processors. Broadcom competes with Nvidia in chips for data center AI networking gear. It indicated that two large customers were developing their own next-generation AI processors using Broadcom's chips. Broadcom is also designing an AI chip for Apple (AAPL).Nvidia shares also fell 2.6% on Dec. 9 amid news that China's State Administration for Market Regulation is investigating whether Nvidia has violated its antimonopoly laws.But Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore noted that \"based on conversations with customers,\" he anticipates the biggest users of application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, will shift back to graphics processing units, or GPUs.Shares gained nearly 4% on Dec. 20 after Moore named Nvidia a \"top 2025 pick.\" But he trimmed his price target on the stock to 166 from 168.The analyst does not expect delays in Blackwell chip production. Moore said that he expects a slowdown in the older Hopper chip. But he adds that will make more high-end memory chips available for its Blackwell line.Nvidia's GPUs can be used for several AI tasks. But ASICs that its rivals are focusing on are meant to fulfill a single purpose. Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein noted that while \"custom silicon will quickly gain share each year from GPUs, GPUs will be dominant for training purposes.\"Best IBD 50 Stocks To WatchIn November, analysts at Piper Sandler projected a 20% upside for the stock and raised their price target to 175 from 140. Nvidia is positioned to gain most from the increase in the total AI accelerator market. Piper Sandler sees that at $70 billion in 2025.Melius Research analysts also raised their price target to 185 from 165 and maintained their buy rating.For Nvidia, its earnings growth is its strong point. The AI chip behemoth continues to be a stock market leader and has an ideal Earnings Per Share Rating of 99, while the stock also shows all-around strength with a Composite Rating of 98.According to FactSet data, Nvidia ranks first among S&P 500 companies for revenue and earnings growth estimates through 2026.Analysts expect a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% in sales for the S&P 500. They see 13.8% growth in earnings per share over two years. But they see Nvidia's two-year compound growth reaching 35.5% in sales and 35.1% in earnings per share.Third-quarter sales came in at $35.08 billion with earnings of 81 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet had estimates of 75 cents per share on sales of $33.17 billion. Sales also beat the AI chip leader's outlook of $32.5 billion for the quarter.Sales nearly doubled from the prior year, when Nvidia reported $18.1 billion in revenue.Meanwhile, bullish trends for artificial intelligence make Nvidia a must-watch. In September, consulting firm Bain said the total addressable market for AI hardware and software will grow 40% to 55% annually for at least the next three years.Demand for Nvidia's next generation graphics processing unit, the GB200, is expected to reach 3 million units in 2026. That compares with 1.5 million for its H100 units in 2023.New findings show that Nvidia was the most bought stock by retail investors in 2024, as they poured nearly $30 billion into the AI stock for the year as of Dec. 17, according to Vanda Research. That takes the crown from Tesla (TSLA), which was the most popular stock among retail investors during 2023.It also replaced Intel (INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in November, becoming the fourth Magnificent Seven stock to join the list of blue chips. The others are Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft.Nvidia's graphics processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications.The company was a pioneer in graphics processors used in such industries as health care, game machines, automobiles and robotics.In March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to CEO Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable chips paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"That helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It had reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales. It also showed four quarters of tapering earnings in late 2022 and early 2023.But then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the six most recent quarters.Nvidia is well positioned to weather higher-for-longer interest rates in 2025 than some rivals, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at brokerage firm XTB, thanks to its high profit margins.Looking at chart signals and technical measures can help investors assess whether Nvidia stock is a buy now.On Monday, the stock remained below its 50 day moving average although it was close to retaking that level. Nvidia stock has to retake the 50-day line and build a base before it becomes a buy again."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is forcing investors to re-evaluate the nations leading internet companies and their potential to capitalize on artificial intelligence thats boosted global peers.Most Read from BloombergNice Airport, If You Can Get to It: No Subway, No Highway, No BridgeSin puente y sin metro: el nuevo aeropuerto de Lima es una debacleThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleIn New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay SuperHow Londons Taxi Drivers Navigate the City Without GPSMarket watchers are increasingly touting how the AI model will be a game changer for Chinese tech companies and their stocks, which have remained under pressure by concerns over the economy. Already Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shares surged last week over such hype, with a gauge of tech stocks entering a bull market on Friday.The refreshed attention could shift investor focus from thinking about risks to thinking about potential when they look at the large Chinese internet names, said Jian Shi Cortesi, a portfolio manager at Gam Investment Management in Zurich. This is positive, especially given the big valuation discount of these names compared to US peers, she added.The upcoming results season may provide stock catalysts in the form of management comments on progress with AI models and demand for cloud services. Meanwhile, options traders have boosted bets on China tech, and the stocks remain historically cheap.The Hang Seng Tech Index entered a bull market after last weeks 9% gain. Still, the gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech stocks is trading at less than 17 times estimated forward earnings, below the Nasdaq 100s 27 times and even its own five-year average of 25 times.Multiples for Chinas tech stocks have suffered from weak demand among domestic consumers as well as intense competition in their e-commerce and cloud businesses. That comes as geopolitical tensions with the US have also reduced global appetite for the nations equities.The lack of foreign investor interest and liquidity in the market was one reason it was a value trap, said Alex Au, managing director at Alphalex Capital Management HK Ltd. Now, DeepSeek has significantly aroused international investors interest in Chinese tech again and should help narrow the valuation gap.The excitement extends beyond the startup level, with Alibaba announcing the latest version of its AI model just days after DeepSeeks release, and touting even better results. That drove its Hong Kong-listed shares up 13% last week. Competing offerings from other majors include Tencent Holdings Ltd.s Hunyuan, Baidu Inc.s Ernie Bot and ByteDance Ltd.s Doubao.The latest wave of services should accelerate AI adoption by enterprises as well as consumers, while also reducing costs for hyperscalers. It also means a boon to cloud service providers like Alibaba and Tencent, given that users rely on cloud computing to run AI infrastructure.The much cheaper and capable model introduced by DeepSeek should help democratize AI in China and encourage usage and spending, said Alphalex Capitals Au. We think the cloud operators like Alibaba will be major beneficiaries.Cloud business growth for Chinese hyperscalers has lagged that of major US peers so far. Analysts estimate cloud revenues for the December quarter rose 9.7% from a year ago at Alibaba and 7.6% at Baidu, compared with 19% at Amazon.com Inc. and 31% at Microsoft Corp.Chinas tech stocks still face pressure from US tariffs on e-commerce shipments as well as Washingtons efforts to restrict the Asian nations access to the most advanced chips. But DeepSeek has helped show that the focus isnt always on highest level of technology.Options bets on the Hang Seng Tech Index have been on the rise, with volumes touching their highest level since early October on Friday. About 6,500 bullish contracts traded that day, almost double the number of puts. June 6,000 calls, which have a strike price 16% above Fridays close, were the most active.There has been a particularly disappointing investment story for Tencent and Alibaba for many years now, said Richard Clode, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has probably been the hottest investment theme on the planet over the past year. Companies involved in this high-growth area have seen their share prices climb in the triple digits and have fueled gains in the three major benchmarks -- the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq.Investors have piled into AI stocks because of the technology's potential to streamline processes and develop game-changing new products and services. Today's $200 billion AI market is forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, offering significant growth opportunities for companies involved -- and investors who get in on these growth stories early.And one particular growth story that's attracted a lot of attention is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a stock that's soared 1,900% over the past five years. The company has gone from primarily serving the video gaming market with its chips to dominating the AI chip market -- and revenue has exploded higher, climbing in the double or triple digits quarter after quarter. But is Nvidia really the greatest AI stock around? Let's find out.So, first, let's talk a bit about AI in general. The technology, by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), is helping companies, researchers, and even you and me in our daily lives on a variety of tasks. Some of these uses are more important than others, and certain can be game-changing. For example, AI is streamlining processes for companies, identifying risks to their businesses, and powering the development of new life-saving drugs and medical devices.Many types of companies could generate earnings growth thanks to AI: those designing the tools for the development of LLMs and AI platforms, cloud providers offering customers access to these tools, companies including AI in the products and services they sell to others, and companies applying AI to their businesses to gain in efficiency and reach new accomplishments. That's a lot of potential AI winners.Now, let's move on to consider Nvidia's position in the AI market. The company is the dominant player in AI chips thanks to the quality of its graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are the fastest around, powering key tasks like the training and inferencing of models. Inferencing is a particularly important function because it involves the reasoning the model goes through to answer complex questions -- and here, it's key to use many high-powered GPUs. So, this represents a growth area for Nvidia.But Nvidia isn't only about chips. The company has built an entire ecosystem of AI products and services, including enterprise software -- and this is allowing Nvidia to remain involved in every stage of a customer's AI development and serve every type of customer.You can go to Nvidia for GPUs and networking options, for example, or you can sign on for enterprise software to streamline the deployment of an entire AI platform. Nvidia even is set to play a big role in the next wave of AI growth: agentic AI, or AI-driven software that can reason and solve problems. The company and its partners have designed AI blueprints to help customers design their own AI agents to be used through the Nvidia Enterprise system.Some investors have worried about rivals challenging Nvidia's dominance, but the company's leadership position today and commitment to innovation will make it difficult for another player to unseat it. Another concern, which arose recently when DeepSeek said it trained a model for less than $6 million, was that Nvidia customers may follow that route -- and cut their training budgets.I don't see that happening. First, experts already are saying DeepSeek's figures aren't accurate -- and the Chinese start-up actually spent a lot more than it announced to train its model. And second, if indeed it is possible to train a model for a very low price, more and more companies would launch AI programs -- offering Nvidia the opportunity to gain on volume. Finally, it's important to remember that Nvidia GPUs could see significant growth as inferencing takes off.So, let's get back to our question: Is Nvidia really the greatest AI stock? There are many very strong AI players out there that make wonderful investments. But, if you're looking for just one AI stock to buy right now, Nvidia is the name to snap up. I consider this company the ultimate AI stock because it benefits from every stage of AI development -- from the infrastructure buildout to the actual application of AI to real world situations. Across those stages, customers will flock to Nvidia, and that should result in fantastic earnings growth -- and share price performance -- over the long run.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Since Wall Street's major stock indexes found their respective bottoms in October 2022, they've been virtually unstoppable. From Nov. 1, 2022 through the closing bell on Feb. 7, 2025, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth stock-propelled Nasdaq Composite have respectively gained 36%, 56%, and 79%.There's no question that artificial intelligence (AI) has played a big role in this outperformance. Any game-changing technology that presents with a $15.7 trillion addressable market by the end of the decade is bound to draw attention.But this isn't the only catalyst responsible for pushing the stock market to new heights.Among the confluence of factors that have also helped lift stock valuations, such as a decline in the prevailing rate of inflation and Donald Trump's return to the White House, is investor euphoria surrounding stock splits.A stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to adjust its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. Keep in mind that these changes are purely cosmetic and don't alter a public company's market cap or affect its underlying operating performance.Though stock splits come in two varieties, investors prefer one far more than the other. Reverse splits, which are designed to increase a company's share price, are the least-desirable of the two. This type of split is usually undertaken by struggling businesses that are attempting to avoid delisting from a major stock exchange.On the other hand, investors often flock to companies completing forward stock splits. This form of split reduces a company's nominal share price, which comes in handy for retail investors who aren't able to purchase fractional shares of stock through their broker.More importantly, businesses that undertake forward splits are typically outperforming and out-innovating their peers. Based on a study by Bank of America Global Research, companies conducting forward splits have handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 in the 12 months following their initial split announcement.In other words, forward stock splits act like a beacon to alert investors to time-tested businesses that, statistically and historically, are poised to outperform.Last year, more than a dozen prominent companies completed a stock split, only one of which was of the reverse variety. While a few forward splits have taken place since 2025 began, none have been from high-profile businesses.But there is one exceptionally well-known company -- sporting a 62,500% gain since its initial public offering (IPO), not including dividends -- which can become the first prominent stock-split stock of 2025.Deciphering which brand-name companies will split their stock next involves more than just locating stocks that have the highest nominal share price.For instance, some companies with an exceptionally high share price have shown no desire to conduct a split, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and homebuilder NVR.Additionally, forward stock splits are enacted to make it easier for retail investors and/or employees to buy whole shares. If a stock has a high degree of institutional ownership, the impetus for a split may not be as strong. For example, even though the share price for auto parts giant AutoZone has topped $3,420, only 7.5% of its outstanding shares are owned by retail investors. It's a somewhat similar story for streaming service Netflix, which has 18% retail non-institutional ownership. Without a significant retail following, companies may delay conducting a forward split.The one brand-name stock that meets the qualifier of having a good amount of non-institutional ownership and an exceptionally high nominal share price is warehouse club Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST). More than 36% of Costco's shares are owned by retail investors.Though Costco has conducted three splits since going public in 1985, none have occurred since a 2-for-1 forward split in January 2000. As of the closing bell on Feb. 7, a single share will set investors back almost $1,044!One of the key reasons Costco has returned 62,500% since its IPO (sans dividends) is its size. This is a company with deep pockets that isn't afraid to buy items in bulk. Purchasing in bulk typically reduces the per-unit cost per item, which translates into lower prices for its members. Costco's management team learned a long time ago that the easiest way to attract and retain shoppers is to undercut mom-and-pop shops and national grocery chains on price.Costco's success is also a function of its membership model. Since the margins on groceries are razor-thin, the respective $65 and $130 annual fee Costco charges members to shop in its stores boosts its bottom line and provides a hearty margin buffer.To build on this point, people who pay $65 or $130 annually for a membership are likely to make their largest purchases at Costco. It's human nature for shoppers to want to get the most out of their annual membership fee.But perhaps the biggest benefit of a stock split for Costco is that it might help mask the company's historically expensive valuation. Its stock is trading at 57 times forecast earnings per share for 2025, with sales projected to grow by a modest 7%. For context, this is more than double the consensus price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the benchmark S&P 500 in 2025, and it represents a 50% premium to Costco's average forward P/E multiple over the trailing-five-year period.Considering that stock-split stocks have historically outperformed in the 12 months following their split announcement, a split may help investors look past Costco's pricey valuation in an already expensive stock market.The table is set for Costco Wholesale to become Wall Street's first prominent stock-split stock of 2025.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then youll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "Who owns the biggest companies in the country? Millions of shareholders. However, a handful of giant institutional investors own the largest stakes.BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) ranks near the top of the list of those huge institutional investors. This company owns a big chunk of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" -- and Wall Street thinks its stock is a screaming buy.The Magnificent Seven consists of the following stocks (listed in descending order based on market cap):Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)Vanguard Group, which isn't publicly traded, is the largest shareholder of each of these stocks. But BlackRock is close behind. It's the second-largest shareholder of all seven of the Magnificent Seven.BlackRock owns around 1.09 billion shares of Apple. This represents 7.28% of the iPhone maker's outstanding shares with a current value of over $253 billion.The financial services company's stake in Nvidia is almost as large. BlackRock's 1.85 billion shares of Nvidia give it 7.56% ownership of the GPU maker and are valued at over $237 billion.Unsurprisingly, its smallest position is in the smallest member of the Magnificent Seven -- Tesla. BlackRock owns 194.7 million shares of the electric vehicle maker representing 6.05% of its outstanding shares. This stake in Tesla is worth roughly $71.7 billion.It makes sense that BlackRock has massive positions in all seven stocks. Many of the company's mutual funds, ETFs, and closed-end funds (CEFs) invest in the Magnificent Seven.Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have been Wall Street darlings in recent years. BlackRock is a Wall Street favorite, too.Of the 18 analysts surveyed by financial markets data and infrastructure provider LSEG in February who cover BlackRock, five rated the stock as a \"strong buy.\" Another nine rated BlackRock as a \"buy.\" The remaining four analysts recommended holding the financial stock.The average analysts' 12-month price target for BlackRock reflects an upside potential of 14%. The most bullish analyst surveyed by LSEG thinks the stock can soar 25% over the next 12 months.What does Wall Street like about BlackRock? The company's pending acquisition of HPS Investment Partners is viewed as a positive by some analysts. BlackRock announced in December 2024 that it plans to buy HPS Investment Partners for around $12 billion. HPS is a top global credit investment manager with $148 billion in client assets. The all-stock deal is expected to boost BlackRock's private markets fee-paying assets under management by 40%.Analysts' overall optimism about BlackRock remains steady even after Vanguard announced lower fees for many of its funds. BlackRock hasn't indicated what changes it might make in response to its main rival's fee reductions.I'm not sure if BlackRock's share price will jump 14% over the next 12 months as the consensus price target reflects. However, I agree with Wall Street's positive take on BlackRock.The company continues to deliver strong growth with revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share jumping 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024. The HPS acquisition should fuel even more growth.President Trump has indicated his willingness to reduce regulations. This could provide a tailwind for much of the financial services sector, including BlackRock.Finally, BlackRock isn't priced at too high of a premium. Its shares trade at 21.5 times forward earnings. Although that's not cheap, it's less than the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple of 22.4.I doubt BlackRock will deliver gains over the next decade as spectacular as some of the Magnificent Seven stocks it owns. However, it nonetheless should be a solid pick for long-term investors.Before you buy stock in BlackRock, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and BlackRock wasnt one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, youd have $795,728!*Now, its worth noting Stock Advisors total average return is 926%  a market-crushing outperformance compared to 175% for the S&P 500.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Elliott Investment Management said on Tuesday it has built a stake of more than $2.5 billion in U.S. refiner Phillips 66, and plans to push for operational changes as well as the sale of the company's midstream business.Phillips 66 shares rose 5.8% in morning trade. In March, the activist investor disclosed a $1 billion stake in Phillips 66, following which the company laid out a performance improvement plan to boost shareholder returns and share price.However, Elliott said Phillips 66's plan \"failed to materialize, and it has become evident that urgent changes are needed\" and that its shares have lagged that of rival refiners.On Monday, Reuters reported the investor had build a stake of over $2.5 billion stake in Phillips 66.Phillips 66 did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment regarding Elliott's plans for its midstream business.\"A streamlined Phillips would include the sale or spin-off of the midstream business, the sale of the company's interests in CPChem and the sale of the JET retail operations in Germany and Austria,\" Elliott said in a statement on Tuesday.If the company does sell or spin-off its midstream business, it could command a valuation of more than $60 billion, the investor said.Phillips 66 had a market capitalization of $51.09 billion as of stock's last close, according to LSEG data.Elliott also stressed that Phillips 66's board needed new independent directors to bolster accountability and conduct a review of management.The hedge fund added that Phillips 66 must commit itself to ambitious refining targets and prioritize profitability at a time when refining margins have dropped for most U.S. refiners.(Reporting by Vallari Srivastava in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Shailesh Kuber)"

Its investment makes it one of the top five investors in Phillips 66.The hedge fund also recommended that Phillips 66 consider divesting non-essential assets such as CPChem and certain European retail operations in order to increase capital returns to shareholders and be able to concentrate more fully on its core refinery business. Chevron Phillips Chemical is a joint venture between Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and Phillips 66 that was created in July 2000.In addition, Elliott wants Phillips 66 to add new independent directors to its board.Phillips 66 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month the Houston-based company reported a fourth-quarter adjusted loss of 15 cents per share on revenue of $33.99 billion. The results beat the expectations of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research, which were calling for a loss of 20 cents per share on revenue of $32.03 billion.Elliott has a long history of activism. Last week Honeywell, one of the last remaining U.S. industrial conglomerates, announced that it will split into three independent companies. The news came after Elliott revealed a stake of more than $5 billion in the aerospace, automation and materials company and pushed for Honeywell to separate its automation and aerospace businesses."

FSGS causes scarring on specific parts of the kidneys. Filspari is already approved to treat patients with IgA nephropathy, another kidney condition.\"An approval not only opens the door for broader Filspari uptake, but would seemingly increase the potential for M&A (mergers and acquisitions) interest,\" Wedbush analyst Laura Chico said in a report.The news sent Travere stock flying more than 13% to 24.03. Shares are now flirting with a profit-taking zone after breaking out of a double-bottom base with a buy point at 19.99, according to MarketSurge.Travere Therapeutics plans to use already completed studies called Duplex and Duet to clinch approval of Filspari in FSGS treatment.

        "content": "By Arunima Kumar and Samuel IndykLONDON (Reuters) - Shares in BP rose by 7% on Monday, and were on track for the biggest daily gain in two years, as investors anticipated that activist shareholder Elliott Management will press for board changes and strategy shifts to boost returns.BP CEO Murray Auchincloss, appointed in January last year, has struggled to reverse the company's underperformance.Expectations Elliott's acquisition of a stake will spur reform on Monday drove shares up by 7% to 463.70 pence by 1223 GMT. If the gains hold, the share will mark the biggest daily increase since February 2023.Investors have questioned BP for lacking a clear strategy to grow its oil and gas business and deliver high returns to shareholders.Its stock last year dropped by almost 16%. Among other energy majors, Shell fell nearly 4%, and ExxonMobil rose 8%.With a market value of about 69 billion pounds ($85.57 billion), BP's valuation is less than half that of Shell.The underperformance also made the British company a potential takeover target. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) considered buying it last year.\"Given the circumstances around the changes to its previous CEO, we think any activist would call for a change in the Chairperson at the very least,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said.BP and Elliott have declined to comment.RESTORING CONFIDENCE?Auchincloss has been trying to restore investor confidence in the company's strategy, following the resignation of his predecessor Bernard Looney in September 2023 for failing to disclose relationships with employees.\"In terms of strategic business reviews, we would expect a push to effectively split up the core oil and gas segment to some of BP's transition growth engines, in order to help minimise capital into these areas,\" Borkhataria said.BP, set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, last month warned of weaker results.It also delayed its investor day to February 26 from February 11 because Auchincloss needed a medical procedure.Auchincloss is expected to use the capital markets day (CMD) to announce his new strategy.Since taking office, he has slowed investments in renewables and low-carbon energy and focused on higher-return oil and gas projects.\"Reports of Elliott taking an activist position in BP emerge at an interesting time with its CMD only two weeks out. Management was already under pressure into this eventthis development, if true, adds to it,\" brokerage TD Cowen analysts said.Elliott has become one of the most influential activist investors with about $70 billion in assets.\"Given Elliott's track record, we believe its involvement could lead to board changes (for BP), portfolio rationalisation, and capex prioritisation on upstream projects, aiming to maximise free cash flow generation,\" Jefferies analyst Giacomo Romeo said.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday Elliott had built a stake without disclosing its size.Bloomberg News earlier reported U.S.-based Elliott was seeking to boost shareholder value by urging BP to consider transformative measures and called Elliott's stake in the company \"significant\".($1 = 0.8064 pounds)(Reporting by Samuel Indyk and Arunima Kumar; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Barbara Lewis)"

        "content": "When e-commerce firm Shopify (SHOP) reports fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday, upside could come from a source under the radar of many investors. Shopify stock should get a boost from the company's new partnership with digital payments firm PayPal Holdings (PYPL).Shopify earnings are due before the market open on Tuesday. Analysts forecast EPS of 43 cents, up 28%, with revenue growing 27% to $2.73 billion. Gross merchandise volume from merchant transactions is expected to grow 24% to $93 billion.The December quarter is usually Shopify's best quarter annually because of the holiday shopping period. In December, Shopify preannounced e-commerce data following the Thanksgiving holiday (Black Friday/Cyber Monday).In the fourth quarter, analysts expect Shopify to get a boost from its push into the \"enterprise\" market. With roots in the small business market, Shopify has recently targeted large companies with e-commerce software and services.Further, Shopify also could get a boost from an accounting change involving revenue recognition related to its PayPal partnership. Shopify will recognize sales from PayPal transactions on a gross revenue basis rather than net revenue.\"Further, the accounting change on the treatment of revenues coming to Shopify through the PayPal button (from net to gross) should bolster growth, though management continues to speak to benefits ramping more materially in 2025, as the mechanical change flows through the U.S. merchant base,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a recent report.Shopify offers its own online checkout button for consumers and has used Stripe to process transactions for merchants on its e-commerce platform.According to UBS, the Shop Pay button accounts for about a quarter of Shopify's gross merchandise volume.On Sept. 9, Shopify and PayPal announced that PayPal would be  another online credit and debit card processor for Shopify Payments in the U.S. Wall Street analysts say Stripe will still handle the majority of transactions. Shopify is an investor in Stripe.At Deutsche Bank, analyst Bhavin Shah in a report noted that Shopify management has stated that the PayPal accounting change should modestly increase gross profit dollars, though gross margins could be a bit lower.Founded in 2004, Shopify launched its initial public offering in 2015. In 2023, the company sold its delivery and logistics business to Flexport, easing investor angst over rising capital spending.Further, the e-commerce stock holds a perfect IBD Composite Rating of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup.IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.PayPal on Feb. 4 reported earnings that topped views but shares fell on the company's revenue outlook.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing."

        "content": "Is the artificial intelligence stock market boom still wired or tired amid the emergence of China's DeepSeek? Top AI stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) face high expectations. For many companies  such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META)  the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity.Amid the rise of generative AI  which generates text, images, and video  it's a good time to be cautious amid the hype, especially given recent developments at Super Micro Computer (SMCI).Many companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge.OpenAI aired a 60-second Super Bowl ad promoting ChatGPT and \"The Intelligence Age. It cost $14 million, said the Verge.Cloud computing titans and tech giants plan big increases in artificial-related capital spending in 2025. They updated plans on earnings calls with Wall Street analysts.\"Hyperscalers' (MSFT, META, AMZN, GOOGL) 2025 estimated capital spending estimates rose $34 billion, or 13%, said Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon in a report. \"The companies are expected to spend $290 billion in aggregate capex (+34% year-over-year). This confirms that the AI capex cycle is intact  no DeepSeek impact yet, But DeepSeek reminds us of the bear case for AI semiconductors.\"On the earnings front, Arista Networks (ANET) reports on Feb. 18. Chip maker Nvidia reports Feb. 26.For Nvidia, ramping up production of next-generation Blackwell AI chips in 2025 has been a key issue. Nvidia stock has retreated 3% in 2025.Further, China startup DeepSeek has roiled AI stocks, including Nvidia.DeepSeek came out of nowhere to release a powerful AI training model developed with much less computing power. AI stocks sold off amid new questions over the outlook for capital spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.Here's IBD's take on the key questions involving DeepSeek, including U.S./China competition in artificial intelligence and the pursuit of human-like AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).The commoditization of AI models could spur application development. While \"training\" AI models has been the biggest driver of capital spending, the market will shift to \"inferencing,\" or running AI applications, in the long run.Having struggled to generate new revenue from \"copilots,\" software companies are now turning to AI agents. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment.What's more, data analytics software maker Palantir (PLTR) has bucked the trend that chipmakers and data center plays are the best AI stocks. PLTR stock has jumped 46% in 2025 after soaring 340% last year.Amid worries over capital spending, Google stock is down 2% in 2025, while Microsoft has shed almost 3%. Amazon has gained 4%. Meta sticks out with its 22% advance.Further, Meta AI now has over 700 million monthly average users , and management believes it is now the No. 1 leading AI assistant. Meta expects to reach 1 billion users in 2025. With AI, the social media giant plans to deliver more personalized and relevant responses for users across apps, including Thread.And, Meta could release its own AI-driven search engine in 2025, posing a new worry for Google. Meta last year hired away Salesforce's (CRM) top AI executive, Clara Shih, to head a new \"Business AI\" group.To be sure, competition is heating up. Amazon is expected to announce a new \"AI Alexa\" at an event in New York City on Feb. 26. Amazon's Echo smart home devices feature the Alexa voice assistant.Among AI stocks to watch, Apple (AAPL) has lagged in 2025. Apple stock has shed 9%. The big question has been whether Apple Intelligence features in iPhone 16 models will spur a big upgrade cycle. Based on Apple's December quarter results, a big AI-driven upgrade cycle has not yet kicked in.In general, semiconductor plays have out-performed software companies as the best AI stocks.The 2025 capital spending plans of cloud computing giants could boost chip makers.But AI chip export restrictions remain an overhang on Nvidia stock as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).Rival Broadcom (AVGO) soared on its AI chip demand outlook. Broadcom makes custom AI chips for cloud computing titans.Qualcomm (QCOM), ARM Holdings (ARM), and Marvell Technologies (MRVL) are other AI chipmakers to watch.Intel's (INTC) artificial-intelligence boss, Justin Hotard, is leaving to become CEO of telecom network gear maker Nokia (NOK).What's clear is that AI stocks are under more scrutiny.\"We expect AI to transition from a 'tell me' to a 'show me' story, with any disconnect between investments and revenue generation to come under increased scrutiny,\" said a Bank of America report. \"Microsoft is the biggest investor in generative AI leader OpenAI, having spent some $14 billion on the startup. But Oracle will now be a big provider of data center capacity to OpenAI for training AI models.Most of Microsoft's new AI revenue comes from its cloud computing business, not software upgrades.Palantir  as well as Snowflake (SNOW) and privately held Databricks  are focused on helping companies use proprietary data to build their own AI models.UBS initiated coverage on C3.ai (AI) on Feb. 10 with a neutral rating. \"The Microsoft-C3.ai strategic agreement could potentially lift revenue growth, but partnerships can take time to materialize and we're more concerned that competition could weigh (near-term)  revenue growth,\" said UBS analyst Austin Dietz in a report.In an IBD interview, ServiceNow (NOW) Chief executive Bill McDermott explained about how the enterprise software maker aims to be an AI winner.Meanwhile, startups OpenAI and Anthropic are battling Google, Meta and others in developing large, multimodal and small language foundation models.Also, AI technology uses computer algorithms. The software programs aim to mimic the human ability to learn, interpret patterns and make predictions.Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to models that processed data to make predictions. The AI models focused on pattern recognition from existing data. Corporate spending on AI projects was modest as companies mulled return on investment.New generative AI models process \"prompts,\" such as internet search queries, that describe what a user wants to get. Generative AI technologies create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own.Companies will aim to boost productivity by developing customized AI for specific industries. Proprietary company data will be used to train AI models.AI systems require massive computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. So the race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.For chipmakers, analysts expect a market for \"edge AI\"  on-device processing of AI apps to emerge.What's more, one key question for investors is whether tech industry incumbents will be the big generative AI winners. Or, will a new wave of AI startups eventually dominate? OpenAI has told employees its now on an annual revenue run-rate of $3.4 billion, up from $2 billion in January.OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding, valuing the startup at $157 billion, up from $86 billion early this year. The new round was led by venture-capital firm Thrive Capital. Microsoft again invested. New investors include SoftBank and Nvidia but not Apple as rumored.Further, OpenAI recently laid out more details of its plans to adopt a for-profit business structure in 2025.Further, Nvidia-based CoreWeave is a new AI cloud infrastructure provider that plans an IPO in 2025.Large language models provide the building blocks to develop applications. Further, LLMs help AI systems understand the way that humans write and speak. Also, LLMs require training data for specific tasks. Companies with access to troves of data hold an edge.OpenAI is part of a wave of LLM startups that includes AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Cohere. Anthropic introduced Claude 3, the newest version of its chatbot, and claimed its performance is better than OpenAI's GPT-4.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing."

        "content": "CVS Health steered through rising costs in its insurance division to handily beat profit expectations on Wall Street.The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager earned $1.64 billion, or $1.30 per share for the period ended Dec. 31. A year earlier the company earned $2.05 billion, or $1.58 per share.Removing one time costs and benefits, earnings were $1.19 per share, easily topping the 89 cents per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.Shares climbed more than 11% before the market opened Wednesday.While the profit blew past expectations, it was short of the same period last year, which CVS blamed on increased medical costs in its insurance division, and lower Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year.CVS Health Corp., based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, runs one of the nations largest drugstore chains and a huge pharmacy benefit management business that operates prescription drug coverage for employers, insurers and other big clients. It also covers nearly 27 million people through its Aetna insurance arm.The health care giant has been hurt by pressure from the Medicaid coverage it manages in several states as well as rising costs from its Medicare Advantage business, which involves privately run versions of the federal governments coverage program mainly for people age 65 and older.On the drugstore side, CVS Health is wrapping up a multi-year plan that includes the closure of more than 1,100 stores.Quarterly revenue totaled $97.71 billion. That beat the $97.06 billion Wall Street was calling for.Looking ahead, CVS Health foresees full-year adjusted earnings in a range of $5.75 to $6 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $5.86 per share.CVS Health is trying to move past a rough 2024 in which the company cut its forecast several times and saw its stock price tumble about 43%.Former CEO Karen Lynch stepped down last October and was replaced by company executive David Joyner.About a month later, the company added four new board members. They included the CEO of shareholder Glenview Capital Management, a hedge fund that has criticized the company for operating below its potential.Glenview holds about 1% of the companys outstanding shares, according to FactSet."

        "content": "(Bloomberg)  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) investors have typically rushed to buy the stock on any dips. But the mood since the DeepSeek-driven rout has been different, signaling that fears of a slowdown in AI spending arent going away.Most Read from BloombergSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleIn New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay SuperNvidia shares slumped 17% in a single day, erasing about $590 billion from the companys market capitalization, after the Chinese AI startup claimed high performance at a lower cost. The stock has since regained some ground, but its still more than 11% below its January record high. Thats despite key customers Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc., (GOOG, GOOGL) Meta Platforms Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) planning a combined $300 billion in capital expenditures this year.Dip buyers didnt step in until Nvidia shares had fallen more than 21% from their peak, a phenomenon thats happened only a handful of times in recent years. It points to increasing investor caution about AI spending  especially because DeepSeek claimed to use fewer chips for its AI model.Theres this underlying concern about when the party is going to end and I think DeepSeek was a wake up call that that may come faster than people think, said Gene Munster, managing partner and cofounder of Deepwater Asset Management. The psychology within a day shifted from being essentially an impenetrable, bulletproof story to one that can viciously change.The negative sentiment has created a very different setup heading into Nvidias earnings, due on February 26. Almost every quarterly report in the last two years has been positively anticipated, with shares trading at or near record highs ahead of the results. This time, the company needs to convince investors who may have started to doubt how much further the stock can run.Read: Big Techs Grip on Market Shows Cracks as Earnings Fall FlatThe negative stock reaction has become the story, and in many ways frames the biggest risk from here, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore wrote in a note last week. With investor sentiment having soured, they wrote that the cynicism is overwhelming. It remains to be seen if revenue acceleration can mitigate that concern; we think that it can, but it remains a debate.The wobble in investor confidence is occurring as Nvidia comes up against past quarters where it saw exponential growth, making year-over-year comparisons difficult to top. The company is expected to report revenue growth of 73%, down from 94% last quarter and significantly lower than the 265% growth in the same quarter last year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Of course, some see the negativity around Nvidia shares as a chance to buy. Evercore ISI analysts led by Mark Lipacis added a tactical outperform rating ahead of the results, saying that the DeepSeek selloff creates an opportunity. And, with roughly two weeks to go before results, shares could certainly make up lost ground.Read: AI Is Major Earnings Focus for US Corporates Far Beyond Big TechThe selloff has also likely made Nvidias valuation more palatable for some investors. The shares are currently trading at about 30 times forward earnings, compared with their five-year average multiple of more than 40 times.Still, with dip buyers not rushing in in a significant way, the shares look precarious ahead of results  especially if the earnings dont top the ever-high bar investors have for the company.If Nvidia disappoints, the shares will probably be range-bound until the second half, said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at SPEAR Invest, adding that concerns around Nvidias Blackwell chips have also been weighing on investors.The rollout of the highly-anticipated new lineup was slowed down by manufacturing challenges and supply constraints. Even though the company has said Blackwell will drive growth amid strong demand, concerns about costs remain.People are already a little bit nervous about Blackwell to begin with. Management has been saying that its on track and everything is great, but for some reason people are not convinced thats the case, said Delevska. Thats probably why youre not seeing the stock bouncing until they report.Tech Chart of the DayMeta shares were edging higher in premarket trading on Wednesday, putting the social media giant on track to extend its record-setting 17-session winning streak.

        "content": "Confluent (CFLT) stock surged early Wednesday after the data software company reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales ahead of expectations. The company also announced an expanded partnership with AI startup Databricks.Confluent earned an adjusted 9 cents per share on sales of $261 million for the December-ended quarter, the software firm said in a late Tuesday news release. Analysts polled by FactSet projected the Mountain View, Calif.-based company to post adjusted earnings of 6 cents per share on sales $257 million.For the same period a year earlier, Confluent posted adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share on sales of $213 million.The data software company also exceeded estimates for subscription revenue, a metric closely watched by analysts. Subscription sales grew 24% year-over-year to $251 million.For the current quarter, Confluent guided for subscription-related revenue of $253.5 million at the midpoints of its range, ahead of the $252.6 million that analysts were projecting. The company also guided for Q1 adjusted earnings between 6 and 7 cents per share, compared to estimates of 6 cents per share.On the stock market today, Confluent stock gained more than 9% % at 32.97  in early trades.  Shares are in an 11-month consolidation pattern with a 34.08 handle buy point.Confluent offers data streaming software, which it describes as a central nervous system for an enterprise's data. The 10-year-old company has the attention of some investors as an artificial intelligence play. Its software is utilized by a list of firms that includes OpenAI to help move and sort data in real-time.\"Our momentum reflects the increasing importance of a complete data streaming platform to power mission-critical and real-time AI applications,\" Confluent Chief Executive Jay Kreps said in the company's earnings release. \"The significant partnerships and product innovations we unleashed over the past year have put us in a great position to advance our category lead in 2025.\"On that note, Confluent also announced an expanded partnership with Databricks late Tuesday. Confluent will integrate its data streaming software and Databricks' Data Intelligence Platform to \"empower enterprises with real-time data for AI-driven decision-making,\" according to the announcement.A rival to Snowflake (SNOW), Databricks is among the highest-valued U.S. startups, with a recent $10 billion funding round that valued it at $62 billion.Following Confluent's earnings report, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz reiterated an outperform call on the stock with a price target of 38, up from 32. Confluent Cloud's 38% growth beat Wall Street estimates, he said in a research note, while the Databricks partnership is \"exciting\"\"More broadly, we continue to expect data streaming adoption will go much higher over the medium-term and beyond, and we view Confluent's platform as best-in-class,\" Moskowitz wrote to clients.Prior to earnings, Confluent fell 4% in Tuesday trading to close at 30.10. Shares have gained 8% so far this year, entering Wednesday trading, and are down 5% compared to 12 months ago.Coming into the report, Confluent stock had an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.Further, Confluent's IBD Relative Strength Rating was 83 out of 99. The RS Rating means that CFLT stock has outperformed 83% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past year."

The first one is Amazon Web Services [sales] number in the fourth quarter was essentially in line with expectations, despite the fact that Azure AWS is facing near-term capacity constraints,\" Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).This embedded content is not available in your region.\"The second opportunity, and I think that the largest misunderstood opportunity when it comes to Amazon is all of their generative AI investments they're making on the retail business. The company did a really good job at laying out all the improvements they're making to their suggestion algorithms, to their advertising products through new diffusion models, the way in which their inventory management is getting better, the way in which they're integrating robots.\"The stock could grind higher as investors price in an improved margin outlook for the retail business, Nowak said.Amazon's fourth quarter had several bearish points, which weighed on the stock  shares fell 4.1% on Feb. 7, the morning after earnings. But the stock has since found firmer footing.About those bearish points.First, Amazon's first quarter outlook came up short.Amazon guided to first quarter revenue of between $151 billion and $155 billion. Analysts were anticipating $158 billion; the miss was partially due to a $2.1 billion expected hit from currency fluctuations.Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have since settled into a first quarter revenue range for Amazon of $153 billion to $158 billion.Second, similar to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), Amazon unveiled a whopper of a capital spending guide.It sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above analyst forecasts at the time of $80 billion to $85 billion.And lastly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales cooled a touch to a 19% year-over-year growth rate. The result was consistent with cloud growth slowdowns at the likes of Microsoft.Perhaps initially overlooked was that Amazon had a good quarter overall.AWS posted its third straight quarter of 19% sales growth. Margins for the cloud services business rose to 46.9% from 29.6% last year. And Amazon delivered its highest quarterly operating income ever at $21.2 billion.Nowak tells me he sees two near-term catalysts for Amazon's stock.One, a Feb. 26 Alexa event in NYC, where an Alexa agent called Rufus could be released. And two, Amazons coming Kuiper-1 satellite rocket launch in March.\"We think as of right now, the initial product that's going to come out of next-generation Alexa Rufus product will probably be a paid subscription product,\" Nowak says.Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "Ryder Systems data on used car sales showed a significant change year on year, according to the companys fourth-quarter earnings released Wednesday morning. That Ryder data is considered a leading indicator of the strength of the used vehicle market. The company only sold 4,700 vehicles during the quarter, compared to 7,200 a year ago. Third-quarter sales also were 4,700 units.The used vehicle price obtained by Ryder (NYSE: R) was down 13% for tractors and 12% for trucks year on year. However, a year ago, the rate of price decline from 2023 was 39% for tractors and 33% for trucks.The 13% year-on-year decline for tractors was an improvement from the third quarter, when the decline was 22%. For trucks, the third-quarter decline year on year was 19%. Ryder also said unit sales out of the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) segment were down 3% for trucks and 2% for tractors sequentially from the third quarter.There was a drop in volume for rental demand across most Ryder divisions. SelectCare, a lease contract under the core FMS segment, had 44,900 vehicles under contract compared to 51,800 a year earlier. Vehicles under contract with Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) dropped to 13,000 from 13,800 a year ago. Not surprisingly, given the acquisition of Cardinal Logistics in February, vehicles under contract at Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) were 19,100 versus 10,900 a year ago.FMS revenue was flat year on year. SCS, the companys contract logistics business, was up 3% year on year. The DTS group was up 39%, reflecting in part the Cardinal acquisition.For the full year, Ryder reported GAAP earnings of $11.06, up from $8.73 in the prior year. In releasing its first forecast for 2025, the company said it expects GAAP earnings of $12.40-$13.40. Revenue growth is expected to be about 2%.The earnings call with analysts is set for 11 a.m. EST.

        "content": "Intel (INTC) stock rose nearly 3% in early trading Wednesday, extending gains from the prior day when Vice President JD Vance made bullish comments about domestic chip manufacturing.To safeguard Americas advantage, the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American designed and manufactured chips,\" Vance said at an address at the AI Summit in Paris Tuesday.Intel stock jumped 6% following the comments. Though Intel has a heaping pile of internal issues that have set back its dominance in chip manufacturing, the company is one of the United States' biggest hopes for domestic AI chip production. Intel is the only large scale American leading-edge foundry for computer chips  which means it manufactures chips for itself and other companies.The overwhelming majority of the worlds most advanced chips for AI are manufactured in Taiwan by TSMC (TSM). Even Intel outsources production of its most advanced AI chips to its rival. While Koreas Samsung (005930.KS) and TSMC have expanded operations in the US thanks to financial incentives from the US CHIPS Act, most of their manufacturing capacity is in their home countries.Its unclear how Trump would \"ensure\" AI systems in the US use US-made chips, as Vance said. Trump on his campaign trail bashed the CHIPS Act, a set of financial incentives for chip companies aimed at bolstering domestic production, which was passed under former President Joe Biden but authored under Trumps first administration. Trump suggested on an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience in October that he would put tariffs on chip imports, believing that would force companies to relocate to the US.[Y]ou put a big tariff on the chips coming in. I say, 'You don't have to pay the tariff, all you have to do is build your plant in the United States,'\" he said.Meanwhile, Intel has fallen far behind TSMC in manufacturing, and current employees at Intels foundry told Yahoo Finance in December that its latest manufacturing process for AI chips has a lot of issues.Intels long-term commitment to foundry has also recently been called into question. The company began its massive push toward opening up its manufacturing business to external customers under CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted by the board in December as investors grew impatient with the money-losing approach. Intel is in the process of searching for a new CEO. In the past week, Intels AI chief left the company to take on the role of CEO of Nokia.Despite the two-day gain, Intel stock is down more than 50% from last year, and its market cap of $91 billion is a fraction of those of Big Tech firms. The company reported its third consecutive year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue in January. Zinsner said Intel Foundry is working to meet its goal of delivering breakeven operating income by 2027.Intels still-nascent foundry business continues to be a drag on its overall revenue despite announcing agreements to build chips for Amazons (AMZN) AWS and Microsoft (MSFT), as Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports.Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Thank you for joining us today. 2024 was a record-breaking year for The Trade Desk. Total spend on our platform exceeded $12 billion, the highest in our history.Revenue for the year surpassed $2.4 billion, growing nearly 26% year over year as we continued to significantly outpace the broader digital advertising market. We generated over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and delivered more than $600 million in free cash flow. These accomplishments underscore both the strength of our platform and our ability to drive value for our clients in the fast-evolving digital advertising landscape. While we're proud of these milestones, I want to acknowledge upfront that for the first time in 33 quarters as a public company, we fell short of our own expectations.During COVID, we revised our expectations once along with the rest of the markets, but for the first time in eight years, we missed the expectations we set, and it was our fault. When we were first contemplating going public about 10 years ago, many people advised me not to IPO. The most common reason was the valuations would be too low because no ad tech company had ever won Wall Street's trust and confidence for any reasonable period of time. I viewed that as a challenge then and I still do now.I knew we had the business model, the TAM, the vision, the grit and the people to break that mold to do something that had never been done before. And the only way to do that was to make promises and keep them. Many people told us it couldn't be done. Our success to this point has been fueled at least in part by our ability to win trust with investors, partners, our industry and our customers.There are very few things that rival that in importance to us. I want you to know that we take this moment seriously, and we want to assure our investors, partners and customers that their trust is well-placed and deserved. Our brightest days are still ahead of us. But before I talk about that, I want to spend a few minutes sharing what we got wrong and the changes we are making to meet this moment and maximize our unique and growing opportunity.Starting off, let me explain it as I see it. What falling short of our own expectations does not represent. This didn't happen because the opportunity isn't as big as we thought. In this case, it isn't because of our competition either.For Q4, the reality is that we stumbled due to a series of small execution missteps, while simultaneously preparing for the future. If this were a sporting event, we'd still have a championship-caliber team. But in this particular game, we turned over the ball too many times. That said, we see a larger and faster-growing market than we originally expected which is why we have been making changes and will continue to do so.Simply put, as you've seen before, as companies grow and become increasingly complex, they need recalibration to unlock new opportunities. We are recalibrating our larger company for an even stronger future. In that effort, I want to highlight four major changes we've made at The Trade Desk in the last few months and some related initiatives that accompany them. First, we did the largest reorganization in company history in December.While we often make structural changes at the end of the year to improve our business, this was bigger than usual. For most people in the company, we provided a much clearer view of their roles and responsibilities and for most, that also meant a change in reporting structure. Additionally, we streamlined client-facing teams, reducing complexity and clarifying responsibilities. Some team focus on brands, while others focus on agencies.Our commitment to agencies remains strong, but we are also expanding brand direct relationships, particularly through joint business plans, which grow 50% faster than the rest of our business. The second, beyond structural improvements, we've placed a stronger emphasis on internal effectiveness and scalability. Over the past two months, leadership has spent more time discussing operational improvements than at any other point in our history. While we've historically been focused on external opportunities, we understand that this moment requires us to scale our internal operations and continue hiring senior talent to support long-term growth.These changes position us to execute at a higher level and capitalize on the expanding market opportunities ahead. Third, we have increased our resource allocation on brands. A broader shift is occurring in the industry. Advertisers are becoming more strategic and data-driven in their media buying decisions, and that's great for us.While this shift has caused short-term fluctuations, it's ultimately aligned with our long-term strength. We recognize that advertising will ebb and flow. At the same time, as advertisers prioritize precision and efficacy, our programmatic data-driven platform is becoming more essential than ever to brands and agencies. This is evident in the growing number of joint business plans or JBPs that we've secured with over 100 of the world's leading brands, many of them in the second half of last year.JBPs provide a structured, mutually beneficial framework for brands, their agencies and The Trade Desk, and they reinforce the long-term value we bring to the industry. They also historically grow faster than the rest of our business. Fourth, we revamped our product development process, shifting back to smaller agile teams that release updates weekly instead of drifting toward waterfall methods, which are less conducive to our fast-paced and changing industry. Our engineering team is now divided into nearly 100 scrum teams with a system to more easily ship and collaborate with the business team on what has shipped and what will ship and when.I expect this to continue to accelerate Kokai enhancements and complete the transition of 100% of our clients from Solimar to Kokai during this calendar year. In Q4, there were a series of decisions we could have made to enhance the short-term performance of the company and neglect the long-term. We consistently choose to focus on the long-term opportunity and maximize our market share over the long term as I believe this is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders. We are keeping our focus on the massive TAM and long-term opportunity.That makes this a good opportunity to bring up two other important and related initiatives. First, we continue to improve and protect the supply chain. First, we announced the Ventura operating system for connected television, which will create a better supply chain for all OEMs, content owners, consumers and advertisers. Secondly, we announced in January, the acquisition of Sincera.Sincera is a metadata company that is dedicated to improving the supply chain of the open Internet. Joining Sincera's work with ours will accelerate a cleaner supply chain for the open Internet and accelerate the work of OpenPath, which is one of our biggest efficiency efforts, both internally and externally. A better supply chain will free up resources internally and improve the ecosystem. The second major accompanying initiative I want to talk about is the investments we're making in AI.Of course, AI is providing next-level performance in targeting and optimization, but it is also particularly game-changing in forecasting and identity and measurement. We continue to look at our technology stack and ask, where can we inject AI and enhance our product and client outcomes? Over and over again, we are finding new opportunities to make AI investments. These changes have helped us start 2025 on solid footing. Not only is our platform the most advanced data-driven decision-making platform in our industry, the ramping of Kokai is advancing the ability of advertisers to find value and precision as they expand their audiences and grow their businesses.In last quarter's earnings report, we itemized 10 macro conditions that are working in our favor. Today, I want to briefly highlight 15 big things we're doing to benefit from those secular tailwinds. Last time we talked about trends. Today, I want to talk about what we're doing about it.First, we're focused on scale. More accurately, we're obsessing about scale. We control $12 billion of ad spend in an approximately $1 trillion advertising industry. With every success we have and with every efficiency we find, operationally and technologically, we follow it with a question, how can we make that scale quickly? While our share is growing faster than perhaps any scaled competitor, our opportunity is growing, too.We can accelerate growth when we sufficiently orient around scale. Second thing, we are preparing for a world where Google exits the open Internet. I'm confident that one way or another, Google will exit the open Internet. I think, they should.Most of their antitrust and regulatory problems come from the draconian ways they have engaged with the open Internet in the past. In April of 2024, Facebook shut down their news program, thereby distancing itself further from one of the most important pillars of the open Internet. Some evidence suggests the substantial majority of spend going through DV360, Google's DSP, is routed to the Google-owned and operated platform of YouTube. Regardless of what happens with the pending trial decision, Google will likely distance itself from the open Internet.If and when Google exits the open Internet, they will leave a big hole and a big opportunity for the rest of us. Relatedly, let's move to number three. Third, we will promote and protect our objectivity more than ever. More and more, the only competitors we encounter today have the worst objectivity problems.Amazon is asking advertisers, big and small, for their advertising budgets. Meanwhile, Amazon competes with most of the Fortune 500 companies in some way, whether we're talking about Microsoft in cloud or P&G in CPG products or UPS or Nike or all the rest. In our very first business plan 15 years ago, we argued that the objective independent DSP should get the lion's share of the marketplace. They'd be the only company that can be trusted.We have a mantra that we've repeated again and again internally for years, and it's this. Every day that goes by, objectivity matters more and more. The fourth thing we'll do, leverage the supply and demand imbalance to make the ecosystem better. In advertising, there is more supply than demand.There always has been and there always will be. This, by definition, makes it a buyer's market. By focusing exclusively on the buy side, we are in the strongest position in the market. Unlike so many players in tech, we are not using our position of strength to become draconian.We are trying to use our ever-growing influence and impact on the industry to make it better and to improve the supply chain. This is why we expect 2025 to be the year OpenPath enters the steep acceleration phase of its S-curve growth. This is because many of the major CTV players around the world are aggressively implementing OpenPath now. They understand that a more efficient supply chain means more money in their pockets.I would argue that higher CPMs through more efficient supply chains are the only way most of the streamers will get to sustainable and scaling profitability. To this end, Disney was among the first of the CTV scale players early last year to embrace OpenPath when they deployed it as part of Disney's Real-time Ad Exchange, or DRAX. As Disney's SVP of addressable advertising said recently, they are working toward 75% of their ad sales being automated by 2027, with the vast majority of those impressions being biddable. Media leaders like Disney realized that the best way to fund their incredible content is through biddable programmatic advertising, which, of course, is great news for us and our partnership.And the best way to help advertisers value impressions and show publishers what they're willing to pay is an open market, and it is through a clear supply chain with tools such as OpenPath that that can be realized. This also extends to the OEMs. Another CTV leader that has embraced OpenPath is VIZIO, which has more than 24 million active devices in the United States and more than 300 ad-supported CTV channels. VIZIO wanted clear line of sight into advertiser demand with as few intermediaries as possible.They deployed OpenPath and immediately saw impressive results, including 39% improvement in revenue from our platform and an eight times improvement in fill rate. Relatedly, Goodway Group is one of our largest independent agency clients. They've been working in Kokai to create a blue list, which is a custom market that they can curate using our tools on our platform to provide their customers to the best opportunities in the market as they see it. With their blue list in Kokai, Goodway was able to prioritize impressions with better, clearer signal around factors such as genre, show title and content quality.In addition, they were able to measure the number of supply chain hops in those transactions. They found that 94% of the impressions they bought had only one supply chain hub, which is well ahead of the industry benchmarks. All of this means that more campaign dollars can now be put to work more effectively in driving incremental reach. These examples provide great background for the pending acquisition of Sincera, which we announced a few weeks ago, I don't think there's any other company in the ad tech ecosystem that thinks about the digital advertising supply chain as passionately as Sincera, except perhaps The Trade Desk.Over the past few years, Sincera has established itself as an objective data company for the entire ad ecosystem, all with a mission of shining a much clearer light on where the value is, where value is being obscured and what signals advertisers value the most in making effective decisions. For us, embedding those data signals into our platform will help encourage the right behaviors that lead to the best outcomes for our clients. For example, one of the most compelling use cases is showing in our platform, which signals advertisers want publishers to provide so they can value ad impressions as accurately as possible. Using these data signals to improve the supply chain for digital advertising could not be more important as we head into 2025.And of course, that's even more important as Google likely becomes less involved with the open Internet. The fifth action we'll take, make CTV the most effective channel and programmatic advertising by layering more data, better auction mechanics and capitalizing on the fact that CTV is the only channel that has nearly 100% of traffic logged in. CTV is the kingpin of the open Internet. CTV should be the first place all brand advertisers spend, not walled gardens.If we expand Sincera's charter and capabilities to CTV and audio, CTV and premium video can reach its potential as a channel. It can be half the pie of the advertising TAM. So many companies like Disney, Netflix, Paramount, MAX, Fox and Peacock need to get the best out of programmatic advertising in order to maximize their opportunity. In order to do that, almost all of the streaming leaders have deployed UID2 as a way of providing advertisers with precision and addressability.This has laid the foundation for them and us to continue the expansion of CTV advertising around the world. CTV continues to be our fastest-growing channel. And as you know, it is also our largest channel. However, neither us nor any content owner thinks the status quo is anywhere close to what end state looks like.The sixth thing we'll do, make 2025 the best year audio has seen yet. I maintain that audio is still the most on-sale corner of the open Internet. Companies like Spotify have been making changes to embrace the potential of programmatic advertising. They're making changes and we're using AI partnerships to bridge the creative creation gap.I think this is one of the biggest opportunities in programmatic and one of the biggest opportunities for a company like Spotify to take their company to the next level. The seventh action item, we'll move 100% of our clients to Kokai this year. Now the majority already have. But today, we're maintaining two systems, Solimar and Kokai.This slows us down. Kokai is more effective in almost every way. We are producing case study after case study as clients continue to lean into the features of our Kokai platform. Every one of them showing the enhancements and effectiveness that goes up with the use of Kokai.As you know, Kokai represents our largest and most important platform overhaul ever. Some clients are still transitioning from our previous platform, Solimar, but well before the end of this year, I expect that all of our clients will be using Kokai exclusively. In all of the case studies coming out of Kokai, the consistent theme is accessing and acting on better data and signal. In CTV, advertisers act on authenticated logged-in user data rooted in UID2.The same is also happening in digital audio, where companies such as Spotify, SiriusXM, Pandora and iHeartMedia have all recently embraced UID2 so that advertisers can act with precision on their logged-in audiences. And with retail data, advertisers can understand conversion rates and the impact of every ad dollar more clearly. Eight, we will change the way the industry manages deals. We'll help advertisers and agencies avoid bad deals, which generally consider too few ad impressions and force advertisers to buy impressions that they wouldn't otherwise want, and we can avoid these bad deals by using AI-powered forecasting.To do this, we are enhancing Kokai with some of the most game-changing parts, like Deal Manager, which lays the groundwork for the forward market, which we think in the future will change the ecosystem and eventually upgrade the upfronts. Ninth, we will continue to invest in AI with provable upgrades and auditable results. We started our ML and AI efforts in 2017 with the launch of Koa, but today, the opportunities are much bigger. We're asking every scrum inside of our company to look for opportunities to inject AI into our platform.Hundreds of enhancements recently shipped and coming in 2025 would not be possible without AI. We must keep the pedal to the metal, not to chest them on stages, which everyone else seems to be doing, but instead to produce results and win share. Tenth, we will simplify our retail offering in 2025. So far, it's been powerful and a significant driver of our growth, but it has often been too complicated.We've studied what works and understand the changes needed to help retail media continue to meaningfully outpace our business. Achieving this will require a closer collaboration with our retail partners. In Kokai, we have the industry's richest retail data environment, including data for many of the world's leading retailers to help advertisers understand the connection between campaign spend and consumer action. We will make this easier to adopt for our clients, both endemic and non-endemic to our retail partners.Consider the fact that our objectivity may be our greatest asset in this corner of our business as well where retailers are reluctant to partner with walled gardens who are competing with them. While, of course, our objectivity, as well as our clear mission, which makes it easy for them to know how we will partner and what our motives are, makes it easy for us together to create the greatest environment of retail data for advertisers on the open Internet. We had some great case studies in Q4 around the world. Boiron, a world leader in homeopathic products, was able to measure a 267% return on ad spend, or ROAS, on Kokai when using Kroger retail conversion data.This was well ahead of their typical benchmarks. In addition, of the almost 2 million households that their recent campaign reached on our platform, 94% of them were new to the brand. In Hong Kong, high-end skincare brand, Sulwhasoo, leveraged UID2 in Kokai to look-alike model prospective new audiences based on their most loyal customers. In doing so, they were able to engage with those prospects across the customer journey at all steps of the marketing funnel across a range of digital channels.As a result of this campaign approach, they were able to measure a six times improvement in physical store visits, a 380% improvement in conversion rates and an 80% lower cost per acquisition. Number 11, we will simplify our platform. As platforms mature, they add features, but that can make it more complex. We will continue to add features and powerful controls for the most sophisticated buyers in the world.However, we're finding ways to improve the experience and make decisions easier and also, more intuitive for our users. Twelfth, we'll use more data. We have another mantra, data-driven buying is better than guessing. Across all parts of our platform, we're using AI to help clients make better decisions, whether it is in making sense of complex data in real-time when it may have previously taken weeks or bringing retail conversion data to bear more often and enriching bid requests.Thirteenth, as I said at the beginning, we will focus on joint business partnerships, or JBPs. JBPs are joint innovation partnerships where agencies and brands collaborate with us to grow our relationship and drive programmatic innovation. They grow about 50% faster than the rest of our business. Brands will generally continue to work with agencies, but they also understand that programmatic is becoming a larger and more important element of their campaign planning.As a result, programmatic decision-making is happening at a higher and higher level within brands, and this presents a tremendous opportunity for The Trade Desk to grow our brand relationships and share. Number 14, on our action item list, we have already revised and will continue to revise our product process. As we grow, it is essential that our product development process remains agile, even as it has to ingest more inputs for more stakeholders. We'll do this with a clear focus on what we're delivering week by week, which continues to be at the bleeding edge of ad tech innovation.And then, lastly, number 15, we'll hire senior leadership to take us to the next level. I believe that over the next few years, we will double the number of senior leaders in the company at the VP level and above, especially, including some very key senior-level appointments in MyOrg. This is a natural part of a high-growth company's journey. We want to scale The Trade Desk significantly in the years ahead, and that means ensuring we have the right kind of leadership rigor across the company while preserving the best elements of what we've done so well so far.To wrap up, the opportunity is bigger than ever. We need to keep evolving our company structure to meet that opportunity and realize our potential and the potential of the open Internet. We are obsessing about ways to drive differentiation and growth. We are constantly innovating our platform in order to do that, most recently with constant upgrades to Kokai.We are able to make these investments because of the profitability of our business model. That focus on constant innovation ensures that we are always prioritizing value for our clients and never standing still. We will always have a long-term view of where the value in our industry is shifting and how we can then innovate to deliver that value to our clients as rapidly as possible. I believe 2024 will be remembered as a pivotal year for our industry, where the premium open Internet was beginning to transform as the clear choice for advertisers seeking data-driven precision and performance.But we've only just turned the corner on this shift, and it is why we are adjusting the company to be bigger and move the market in positive ways. I am not happy with our results in the fourth quarter, but there is so much opportunity in 2025 and the years ahead to help our clients take full advantage of data-driven advertising on the premium Internet to drive growth and brand loyalty for their businesses. And that's why I'm confident that Trade Desk will eventually resume acceleration and continue the path we've been on for over 33 quarters as a publicly traded company. We are also the clear leader in the DSP race and perhaps the leader of the open Internet.Thank you. And with that, I'll hand it over to Laura to discuss our financials.Laura Schenkein -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Jeff. Before discussing our results, I want to expand on Jeff's sentiments about some of the significant strides we made over the past year, positioning us well for the future. 2024 was a year of landmark partnerships, particularly in CTV, where we saw outsized growth. Retail media continued its rapid expansion, establishing a material foundation for the years ahead.International growth accelerated, showing promising momentum beyond the U.S. Additionally, 2024 marked our largest and most successful year ever for political ad spend, the biggest year for UID2 since its launch four years ago, and a leap forward for digital audio and programmatic. When I look across our list of growth drivers, most of them are still in their early stages compared to where we expect them to be in the next five to 10 years. CTV advertising remains a small fraction of total TV ad spend relative to linear.Retail media is scaling rapidly, evolving from an emerging trend into a core digital advertising channel as brands are recognizing its ability to drive both performance and measurement. And in most global markets, decision programmatic is still in early stages of adoption with tremendous long-term growth potential. Turning to our results. Q4 revenue was $741 million, a 22% year-over-year increase.We generated $350 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, representing a 47% margin. However, for the first time in our eight and a half years as a public company, excluding the first quarter of 2020, our results came in below our expectations. As a company, we take great pride in our ability to forecast accurately, and we take full ownership of the shortfall. Importantly, this miss was not due to a lack of opportunity or increased competition.It was on us. We are implementing the strategic changes Jeff outlined in our business, and I believe that will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout this year and beyond. For 2024, we ended the year with $12 billion in spend on our platform and $2.4 billion in revenue, representing a 26% increase in revenue year over year. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin was above 41% and full year free cash flow was over $630 million.As expected, our take rate in 2024 once again remained within a very consistent historical range. The shift of advertising dollars to CTV continues to be a core driver of our business. From a scale channel perspective in Q4, video, which includes CTV, represented a high 40s percentage share of our business and continues to grow as a percentage of our mix. Mobile represented a mid-30s percentage share of spend during the quarter.Display represented a low double-digit share of our business and audio represented around 5%. Geographically, North America represented about 88% of spend, and international represented about 12% of spend for the fourth quarter. International growth again outpaced North America for the eighth quarter in a row. CTV growth across international regions was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and throughout 2024.In terms of verticals that represent at least 1% of our spend, growth was broad-based again this quarter. We saw strong performance in the majority of our verticals, particularly in automotive, shopping, and technology and computing. Political spending was also strong in Q4 as expected. Home and garden and pets were both below average.We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for us to gain share in all of the verticals we serve. Turning now to expenses. Q4 operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were $460 million, up 23% from a year ago. During the quarter, we continued to make investments in our team and platform, particularly in areas like sales and marketing and technology and development as we position the organization for long-term growth.Income tax expense was $39 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our profitability and stock-based awards. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $297 million or $0.59 per fully diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities was $199 million and free cash flow was $177 million in Q4. DSOs exiting the quarter were 97 days, down four days from a year ago.DPOs were 80 days, down three days from a year ago. We ended the year with a strong cash and liquidity position. Our balance sheet had about $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter. We have no debt on the balance sheet.In Q4, we repurchased $57 million of our Class A common stock via our share repurchase program. As you saw in our press release, we announced an additional authorization under our share repurchase program, bringing the total to $1 billion, inclusive of the amount remaining from the existing authorization. Given our strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation, we plan to continue opportunistic share repurchases, while also offsetting dilution from employee stock issuances. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter.We expect revenue to be at least $575 million, reflecting 17% year-over-year growth. Our Q1 growth estimates also reflect the impact of lapping the extra day from the 2024 leap year, as well as political ad spend, which contributed approximately 1% of our Q1 2024 revenue. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $145 million in Q1. Turning to our expense outlook for the year.While we are not providing a full year expense guidance, we anticipate a modest increase in the growth rate of our operating expenses in 2025 compared to previous years. As a result, we would expect modest deleverage for the year. Our investments are focused on key areas such as infrastructure and talent. Our incremental investments align with the recalibration efforts Jeff outlined in his remarks.Our capital intensity remains low, and we expect capex to be approximately 5% of our total revenue. We expect another strong year of cash flow generation. We continue to manage the business with a balanced perspective that allows us to weigh investment opportunities while retaining flexibility for margin improvement. In closing, while the back half of 2024 did not end exactly as we had hoped, our long-term trajectory remains strong.I'm optimistic about 2025. We continue to lead in a rapidly growing industry, delivering profitable growth and gaining significant market share. Our momentum is fueled by a strong set of growth drivers, including ongoing secular shift to CTV, enhanced measurement through retail data, international expansion, a robust identity framework, supply chain improvements and the ability to drive long-term leverage in our model. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to sustain this growth and capitalize on the opportunities before us.While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect that our recalibration efforts and strategic investments will position us for continued strong growth throughout 2025 and beyond. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Shyam Patil with SIG. Please proceed.Shyam Patil -- AnalystHey, Jeff, as you know, I've been covering you guys since you've been public and following the company long before that. And until now, for over eight years, you guys have had an amazing run where you've hit your guidance every single time. Just wondering, can you just talk about what went wrong in the fourth quarter where you guys came in below your expectations? Thank you.Jeff Green -- Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Thanks, Shyam. Really appreciate the question. So first, let me own that we missed and that we missed our own expectations, as you point out, which is, in my mind, very different from missing Wall Street's expectations.So when we set our guide and set our expectations, I view that as a commitment. It's understandable in a moment like this for those outside the company, especially shareholders to be wondering what does this mean? Is the opportunity not as big as The Trade Desk claims? Or is it different than what they thought? Is the company not executing? Is there something wrong? If so, is it big or is it small? And I just wanna be super clear, we missed because we had a series of small execution missteps. We needed to execute while simultaneously trying to prepare for our future, and we made a number of small mistakes, but -- and trade-ups that compounded. To, again, compare it to a pro sports team, we have a championship team.We've proven that for the last eight years as a public company, but we turned over the ball too many times in this game, and that's why we lost the game. The opportunity is not smaller than we thought. In fact, it's the opposite. My focus the last quarter and now is about recalibrating the company to become a bigger company because we're facing a bigger opportunity faster than we thought.So I just want to reiterate some of the changes that we've made and we're making those to make certain that this doesn't become a pattern. So here's a couple of those. First, for most people in the company, we provided a much clearer view of roles and responsibilities and that also meant a change in reporting structure in what was the biggest reorg in the history of The Trade Desk. Second, in engineering, we've reviewed the way that we ship product, our overall product process, and we've implemented a process of smaller agile teams who ship product every week.Some teams had drifted to be a little bit too waterfall-like as we strive for big milestone releases like Kokai and we've structured to be more agile again. And in most cases, we've created two pieces of teams that ship product every week. As I mentioned before, these are roughly 100 scrum teams, very small teams to be very agile that are shipping frequently. We've historically been one of the most focused and most productive engineering teams ever pointed at ad tech.I think, we still are, but we can be more efficient than we are today. Third, we also restructured our client-facing teams. As we've grown, we've started to overlap between our agency and brand teams, and that's become complicated and in moments not very helpful or useful. As a result, we simplified.Some people focus on brands, some people focus on agencies. We've created much clearer engagement between them. And relatedly, I want to reinforce that we are loyal to the agencies and our strategy to support them and partner with them continues into our future. We will continue to be great partners to the agencies.But we also will continue to expand our brand direct conversations and continue to focus on JBPs and especially given that JBPs grow about 50% faster than the rest of our business, we naturally want more of those and this is one of the pockets where we're investing most with new people. And then, fourth, in December, January, we've spent more time discussing what we can do to improve than ever in the history of the company. For most of the last 15 years, we focused most of our efforts on addressing the opportunity on the horizon. Lately, we've been discussing how to make our own people, operation more efficient and more scalable.The process has been very good for our long term, and it's also highlighted that we need to continue to hire very senior people who can help our company scale. On a final note on your question, Shyam, for much of 2024, we were faced with some big strategic decisions, honestly, more than usual. And some of these were questions where the long-term and the short-term were at odds. Do we focus on the short-term revenue or build the long-term? And I just want you all to know that my bias is always toward capturing the long-term opportunity.I'd rather miss a quarter than to trade a long-term. Kokai enhancements continue to inject more AI, more sophisticated buying techniques and massive enhancements to the supply chain, which is the motivation for acquiring Sincera, a metadata company that will start being accretive to Trade Desk before the end of this year. As you know, this is only the third acquisition in the history of the company. And while we never want to get distracted with acquisitions to make headlines and then never integrate the way so many others do, we will look for companies that enhance our long-term opportunity.That's why we made this acquisition, and that's why we're so optimistic about what it can do for our future. Shyam, I really appreciate the question.Shyam Patil -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOK. The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball Research. Please proceed.Vasily Karasyov -- AnalystThank you. I wanted to follow up on the first question. So going into your earnings report, there were a lot of concerns I heard about weaker brand spend post-election, no budget flush, then issues with Kokai rollout pace. But then, other ad-funded companies haven't reported anything, results similar to yours.So can you probably share a little more detail about what you observed about the difference between you and the industry? And to what extent did factors like polarized political environment, for example, The New York Times calls them out quite a lot, lower Q4 GDP print or any product rollout issues impacted the shortfall in Q4? Thank you.Jeff Green -- Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Vasily, for the question. I just want to point out, in 2022, macro was a factor. The advertising was sharply decelerating. And yet, we were agile then, and we were efficient.And we still significantly outperformed the market and beat expectations, our own specifically. I bring that up to say that we've had challenging environments before, and we still outperformed. The GDP, unusual election uncertainty, continued pricing pressure on some consumers and some companies doesn't create an ideal environment. And this one wasn't a perfect environment.But we've outperformed in environments like this one before, as I pointed out in 2022, but we didn't this time. Political put some advertisers on the sidelines, that's absolutely true. But it also brings out budgets, especially, of course, the political budgets. And on the net, was it a positive or a negative? To me, it's too close to call.The environment wasn't perfect, but we knew that when we guided even if it was slightly harder than we thought. We've navigated that before. So you're right. And I know there's gonna be 1,000 questions, a bunch of you -- well, we actually started a couple of them, and I know there will be more because we've done so well for so long at setting expectations.And when we talk about the missteps specifically, many of them involve people, mistakes that aren't appropriate to discuss publicly, especially when people are already learning from these mistakes. One of those, you're right, that Kokai rolled out slower than we anticipated. But much of that was for good reason. We've seen moments and places to inject AI like improving the foundation of our forecasting and performance models.That is a short-term negative, for sure, but it is a long-term negative. We are working -- I'm sorry, it's a long-term positive, sorry. We are working really hard to get the deals right and lay the groundwork to move the upfront to digital. Again, long term, I think this is amazingly good for us.And I'm confident we're building the right things. In other words, in some cases, the slower Kokai rollout was deliberate. A quicker rollout would result in more short-term spend, and we don't always build what the customers want. Instead, we are trying to understand what the customer needs.Elevating us and them together is a much harder task than simply taking orders. So as it relates to the internal changes, I think it's best to operate a company with our talent and the opportunity that we're facing to build the org and the team of the future as fast as possible so that we capture the most market share possible at end state. As I said in the prepared remarks, from the beginning, I've argued that the objective independent focused DSP is the one that should get the largest market share, the lion's share, not the walled gardens who are full of conflict of interest. We're fighting hard to get there first.Our focus, our objectivity and our agility are essential to win. I want to get bigger, and I don't want to slow down, but to do that requires us to change. The silver lining, if you want to call it that, and I do is that we believe that this is in our control. It's ours to lose and we will be a better company as a result of the changes that we're making, and it will be a long-term positive.Vasily Karasyov -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOK. The next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.Justin Patterson -- AnalystGreat. Thank you very much. Jeff, really appreciate that degree of detail. I guess, as you step back and move through this recalibration period, how do you view the company's potential to sustain a 20%-plus compound growth rate over the next several years? I know you don't provide annual guidance or long-term targets, but I think that would be just helpful for us to kind of think through what the business looks like as you come out of this period.And then, Laura, separately, how should we think about the investments required to get us to that point? Thank you.Jeff Green -- Founder and Chief Executive OfficerJustin, thanks for the question. I really appreciate actually all the questions. I feel like we are getting to the heart of the issues. So this is honestly giving me a platform to talk about the things that I think matter most.So on this one, I think it really comes down to how we approach our business. In my view, we have to obsess about making the open Internet better than walled gardens. Walled gardens have cheap inventory. And I think there's a lot of people that are chasing cheap even if it doesn't help them in the long term.But we have the best of the entire open Internet on our side and via our platform. Our supply chains are very different from others, especially the walled gardens. They control their small ecosystems, but I think we have something way better going for us. If you just look at any trade media today, you'll see that brands are increasingly wary of the dangers of cheap reach.Meanwhile, we have access to all the media that people love most. CTV, movies, journalism, all of music, that's all the premium open Internet. And while we don't control the supply chain end to end the way walled gardens do by the nature of walled gardens, I think that's a way better long term for us and for the market because competitive markets become more efficient over time. The competition of our markets are working for us, and we are in a very strong position being on the buy side.but there's so much to do to make the supply chain more efficient and to make our company more efficient. I just want to remind everybody that last quarter, I outlined 10 macro factors or secular tailwinds that are driving our business. Those have not changed. We believe that while our share has been growing faster than any of our scaled competitors, I also believe the opportunity is growing, too, and that's why we're recalibrating now.I believe that we can reaccelerate our growth again. For us, we need to focus on what we are doing about it, and that's the 15 themes that we outlined. And just to summarize a couple of those. We need to focus on scale.We need to focus on the whole that Google and Facebook are leaving as they turn their attention away from the open Internet. We need to promote our objectivity against cheap reach. We need to improve the supply chain. In fact, we're obsessing about it.We need to grow CTV. And right behind that, we need to grow audio. While CTV may be the biggest opportunity, audio might be one of the most untapped and I continue to argue it's the most on-sale corner of the Internet. We need to grow our JBPs or, in other words, get closer to brands and maintain our closeness with the agencies.We have proven for years now that we can do both. And we need to ship products for the future, and that includes AI, that includes getting Kokai to 100% before the end of the year. So we have a lot of work to do, and we're incredibly focused on it. We are all in agreement on what needs to happen in order for us to take the company to the next level.But Laura, I know there's a lot that you can elaborate on Justin's second part of his question from the financial perspective. Laura?Laura Schenkein -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Thanks, Justin. On the investments required for 2025. First, just looking back at 2024, we delivered an incredibly strong year in terms of profitability and cash flow generation.And we exited the year with a strong balance sheet. So as I mentioned in the script, we anticipate a modest increase in the growth rate of our operating expenses in 2025 compared to previous years. And as a result of that, we would expect some deleverage for the year. Our investments are going to focus on key areas such as infrastructure and talent and those incremental investments align with the recalibration efforts Jeff outlined in his prepared remarks.So we continue, as we always have, to be very deliberate about our investments in our hiring. Our capital intensity also remains low. We expect capex to be approximately 5% of total revenue. And when I look across our growth drivers, frankly, I believe nearly all of them are still in their early stages compared to where they will be in five to 10 years.So if we generate significant revenue gains, we'll continue investing. And if not or if the current environment significantly changes, we'll have the flexibility to adjust our investment pace accordingly. I also just want to point out that today, we announced an additional share repurchase authorization, bringing the total to $1 billion. As of the end of 2024, approximately $464 million remained on the authorization.So as I've always said, we take an opportunistic approach to our share repurchase program. We're guided by market conditions on our capital priorities. So that's how I would summarize our 2025 investments. Operator, we can move on to the next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please proceed.Youssef Squali -- AnalystAwesome. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. So Jeff, I'm very curious about your Google comments. So are you already observing a significant shift in an advertiser sentiment? Or is the transition occurring at a much more gradual and measured manner? And if it is, how do you frame and size that longer-term opportunity? And then, Laura, just quickly, what was the political contribution in Q4, please? Thank you.Jeff Green -- Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks for the question. So I'll try to be a little more brief on this one, so Laura can answer, we can continue on. But -- so let me just frame what I think is happening with Google and first start by just talking about what's happening right now and has for the last little while. The network business at Google has been shrinking and shrinking for years.And to me, this is evidence of the deprioritization. Google continues to focus on Gemini and cloud and AI and search and YouTube. I think that makes sense for them to do if you look at where the money comes from. I think the network and open Internet business is way less important to them than it has ever been.So as a result, I'm confident that one way or another, Google is going to exit the open Internet. And I think that makes sense, actually, for them. If you think about it, most of their antitrust and regulatory problems come from the ways that they have managed the open Internet in the past, and that has created a lot of baggage for them today, especially as it relates to interactions with governments and markets around the world as they look to really grow in places like Gemini and cloud and AI and search and YouTube. So if you then look more closely at where we compete specifically.And I've often said, we don't compete with big Google. We compete with the 27th highest priority at Google, which was once DV360. And now, I believe, that has been downgraded when you compete with something like the 47th highest priority at Google. But that is less and less becoming a competitor because the majority of spend that is going through DV360 seems to be routed to YouTube or at least that's what the evidence suggests.So I believe that regardless of what happens with the pending trial, Google will distance itself from the open Internet. The trial could make it so that they leave quickly and with some sort of announcement or they could keep backing away slowly. But either way, the trend suggests that there is a hole and it is getting bigger. I think, Google will leave a very big hole eventually, and that is a big opportunity for the rest of us in the open Internet.I think, it makes us possible to continue to service the open Internet and their deprioritization creates more room for us. I think, we can benefit from it more than any other company. But in my humble opinion, Google has been the biggest hindrance to the effective supply chain of the open Internet than any other company and an abrupt change could happen this year or next, and that would be good for us. But at the same time, we have to be positioned well to capture the opportunity.I do believe that opportunity is getting bigger. And I -- if you ask me what I lose sleep over, I lose sleep over missing the opportunity. I'm being ready for that opportunity. And it's part of the reason why I'm actually excited about all the changes that we are talking about today because I believe that the changes that we're making are helping to make this company more scaled so that we can respond to the hole that's being left from these very big companies paying less and less attention to the open Internet.Laura, the second part of the question?Laura Schenkein -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Thanks, Youssef. Just quickly on political. It was about 5% of the business in the fourth quarter, and that was a peak.So for the year, it was in the low single digits.Youssef Squali -- AnalystOK. Thank you.OperatorOK. The next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.Jason Helfstein -- AnalystThank you for taking the question. So Jeff, I just wanted to ask a bit about Amazon. It's gotten a lot of investor attention, a lot of trade press as far as the company making improvements to their DSP, getting aggressive with Prime Video ads. Just how do you view them in the competitive landscape? Did you see any kind of change in the fourth quarter? And just, I guess, how do you think about them as a competitor going forward? Thank you.Jeff Green -- Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet. Thanks for the question. So of course, when you go through a recalibration and you're in a moment like this, I think it calls for a reflection and retrospection. And I've spent a lot of time thinking about sort of what are we sure of, what are the bets that we doubled down on.And as I wrote in the first business plan and I've been saying for 15 years, at end-state, there's only gonna be a handful of DSPs, I think one of them, probably one, maybe two. But with today's visibility, I would say, there's likely to be one is gonna be an independent and objective DSP. And that should get the lion's share. As it relates to Amazon's DSP, objectivity matters more than it ever has.Every day that goes by, it matters more and more. And Amazon's objectivity problem is way worse than Google's because Amazon competes with nearly every company in the Fortune 500 or at least the majority of them. But I know there's a lot of focus that goes to Amazon as it relates to advertising. And I think it's really important that investors parse out the three roles that Amazon plays in advertising.The biggest one by far is that they are a search engine, competing with Google's core business, if you will. And that is the biggest source of revenue for them in advertising. The second is probably Prime Video. And I think that one is very interesting because I think that the right way to look at them is somebody like Paramount or like Fox.They are creating premium content, and they created a lot of ads as a result of that. But I see no reason why that shouldn't join the premium open Internet and that we shouldn't partner with them on that. And I do think long term, that's in their best interest and ours as they think to monetize that. And as we've talked about before, I believe Amazon tends to look at things separately and try to get every department to be profitable on their own.And I do think that that creates a big opportunity for us. As it relates to the DSP itself, again, they have an objectivity problem that's a much, much smaller business than the other two. And I think that particularly the second one represents an opportunity for partnership. The third is a competitor that I don't view nearly as a competitor that most of the other players in the space are simply because of their objectivity problem that over time, I think, gets worse for them.So I'm excited about what that means for us and for our future and our prospects to compete in what I think will be a more and more competitive market as the TAM gets bigger. Thanks, Jason.OperatorOK. The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BA Securities. Please proceed.Jessica Ehrlich -- AnalystThank you. One for Jeff and one for Laura, if it's OK. Jeff, it seems like OpenPath is at a tipping point this year, and it was one of your Top 5 priorities or focus. Can you just talk a little bit about the details, the plans for the coming year and also, how the acquisition of Sincera will contribute to OpenPath's adoption? And just for Laura, I just -- can you give us some color on the expense ramp? Your Q1 guide implies a pretty significant margin compression.So is that indicative of a full year margin deleveraging as you said? Or is Q1 kind of the biggest impact in the operating expense ramp?Jeff Green -- Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Laura. I appreciate the question. So let me just first remind everybody what OpenPath is. Basically, we made it possible for the biggest content owners in the world to integrate with us directly.So if they choose to do their own yield management or build it themselves, they don't need to use an SSP. They can be an SSP themselves if they'd like to. We expect that many of the biggest content owners in the world will take this route, especially in CTV and audio because it's financially worth it for them to do it, and they want to control their own fate as it relates to yield optimization. So we've made it possible for them to plug into us directly.It's taken us a little bit of time to get them to do so because we've historically not partnered on that level, as well as mostly it's because they have to build technology in order to do that on their own. But we've had that option available for a couple of years. As streaming wars and competition heats up, as well as the fact that SSP's business models have become more and more at odds with CTV content owners and with streamers of all kinds, including audio, it makes it so that they are all interested in doing a direct integration with us and managing their own yield management. And so, because of the number of deals that we've signed recently, we are extremely confident that 2025 will be the year that we enter the steep part of the S-curve and that we've been paying our dues for years and that this will pay off this year.As it pays off this year, we think that means a more effective supply chain. And in order to ensure that that happens, we also bought Sincera, the metadata company that helps us evaluate what's happening across the entire supply chain, to make certain that we have visibility, as well as we provide visibility to the open Internet so that they can know what changes to make in order to make the supply chain more effective. It's not something we are trying to keep for ourselves but to use to make certain that everybody in the ecosystem knows how to make a more effective supply chain. This is what I was talking about before, where I believe that we have a more difficult burden than other players in the space in the sense that we are leading the open Internet and can make the entire supply chain more effective if we play the right role.And I think we found a way to do that with the Sincera acquisition, which will create more price discovery, create better standards and we'll make it so that we are only buying the inventory from those who describe it best and describe it accurately. And if they don't, we won't buy it. And that is a luxury that we have as the supply demand imbalance grows everything day. Laura, your part of that?Laura Schenkein -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Jessica, with regard to your question about Q1 EBITDA, I did mention in the script that we do anticipate a modest increase in the growth rate of our operating expenses in 2025 and that we'd see some deleverage for the year. I wouldn't recommend thinking about it linearly. Typically, in our business, EBITDA improves as the year progresses, which is just driven by our investment choices and seasonality in business.Chris Toth -- Vice President, Investor RelationsThanks, Jessica. And John, we have time for one more question.OperatorYes. Our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please proceed.Mark Mahaney  AnalystOK. Thanks. I don't know of another company that's 32 for 33, so you've, obviously, been doing something right. Two questions I wanted to ask.Jeff, you mentioned senior leadership that you want to hire. So can you brief on that a little bit, like in what areas? And then, second, you mentioned resuming acceleration in revenue. So at a high level, forget about the numbers and the specific timing, what factors like could you triage and what factors would most contribute to a reacceleration in revenue at some point? Thanks a lot.Jeff Green  Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Mark. Really appreciate it. I'll highlight one of the areas where I think that we can hire. Let me first say, I appreciate the compliment.I am super proud of the fact that we have done this 32 quarters in a row. And while I'm disappointed that we didn't do it this time, we knew at some point we would have to miss. And as I've said to the team, I'm excited for the opportunity to prove to the world what happens next that we know that people will be responding or looking to see how we respond. And I'm actually grateful for the opportunity.So on that level, I think one of the things that we have to do is we have to keep adding to our team and looking to how we can enhance our go-to-market. One thing  we make this sport analogies, but one thing that's very different about that is if you're playing basketball, you put five guys on the court, that's different in business where you can just add to the team. And I think there are some opportunities for us to get more efficient. We've done all of this without a COO for some time.There is absolutely no reason why we shouldn't add a world-class COO to the team. And then, of course, as we're looking to be operationally more rigorous, we want somebody to come help us do that. That's an area that I think is fairly obvious for us to have. There are others as well, but I just offer that as a suggestion where we can definitely level up in our operational efficiency.On the second part of the question?Mark Mahaney  AnalystFactors that could cause reacceleration.Jeff Green  Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, the factors that cause acceleration. There are so many, and it's really hard to sort of put a coefficient on all of the 15 things that we set in this quarter and all of the 10 that we highlighted in terms of secular tailwinds from before. But big picture here, we have $1 trillion TAM. We currently control a little over 1% of it.We think we have 98% of the TAM left and the CTV should be fast growing. Outside the United States should be growing faster than the United States for obvious reasons. Audio is untapped. I think, Spotify highlighted this in their earnings.I think there's a tremendous opportunity for them and for us and for the open Internet. That can come from that. I think there's a lot of inefficiencies in the supply chain, but now we're just at the right size where we can change it, where we're big enough to create changes. And those are four of them, but honestly, I think I'm leaving off a whole bunch of them.Mark Mahaney  AnalystOK. Thank you, Jeff.Chris Toth  Vice President, Investor RelationsThanks, Mark. And John, we can close out the call.Operator[Operator signoff]Duration: 0 minutesChris Toth  Vice President, Investor RelationsJeff Green  Founder and Chief Executive OfficerLaura Schenkein  Chief Financial OfficerShyam Patil  AnalystVasily Karasyov  AnalystJustin Patterson  AnalystYoussef Squali  AnalystJason Helfstein  AnalystJessica Ehrlich  AnalystMark Mahaney  AnalystMore TTD analysisAll earnings call transcriptsThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

        "content": "By Casey HallSHANGHAI (Reuters) -Alibaba will partner with Apple to support iPhones' AI services offering in China, its chairman said on Thursday, a move likely to help the U.S. company ease falling smartphone sales in its key market.For Alibaba, the partnership is a major win in China's competitive AI market that is home to DeepSeek, which made headlines this year with models developed at a fraction of the cost of Western rivals.The landmark deal also resolves months of speculation over Apple's AI strategy in the region as the iPhone maker had been in talks with Chinese tech leaders including Baidu, ByteDance and Tencent, Reuters and the Information have reported.\"They talked to a number of companies in China. In the end they chose to do business with us. They want to use our AI to power their phones. We feel extremely honoured to do business with a great company like Apple,\" Tsai said at the World Government Summit in Dubai.While Apple's phones outside China utilize a combination of its proprietary Apple Intelligence and OpenAI's ChatGPT, Tsai did not specify whether the Alibaba partnership would follow a similar model.In China, consumer-facing AI products require regulatory approval, and The Information reported earlier that both Alibaba and Apple have already submitted materials to authorities.The Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba jumped as much as 9.2% to HK$124.3, their highest since January 2022. The stock pared gains to close up 2.6%.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"Instead of viewing the Alibaba-Apple partnership through the lens of China's AI strength, the partnership is mainly a recognition of Alibaba's AI capability,\" said Lian Jye Su, a chief analyst at tech research firm Omdia.Other analysts said the impact for Apple would depend on how fast it rolled out features in China.\"It won't be an easy fight as the local competitors have been aggressively marketing their own AI features,\" said Will Wong, an analyst with research firm IDC.CRITICAL TIMEThe AI integration comes at a critical time for Apple, which has faced declining iPhone sales in China amid growing competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei.Industry analysts have pointed to the absence of advanced AI features - a key selling point in latest-generation smartphones - as a significant disadvantage for Apple in the Chinese market.Apple suffered a notable setback in China in 2024, losing its crown as the country's leading smartphone vendor. For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 28, Apple's Greater China sales plunged by 11% to $18.51 billion.According to market research firm Canalys, Apple's annual shipments in China fell 17%, allowing domestic manufacturers to surge ahead.Vivo captured the largest market share at 17%, while Huawei secured second place with 16%, pushing Apple to third place with 15% of the market.Alibaba has become a Chinese AI favourite among investors early in 2025, with its stock price up more than 40% so far this year.The firm in late January released a new version of its Qwen 2.5 artificial intelligence model whose functionality it said surpassed that of DeepSeek-V3, which caused a stir earlier this year for its capability and low cost.(Reporting by Casey Hall and Liam Mo; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree, Shri Navaratnam and Alex Richardson)"

        "content": "They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This was certainly the case for investors who took the plunge on e-commerce platform stock Shopify (SHOP) when it formed an unsightly consolidation pattern. After breaking out in early 2019, it went on to rack up gains of more than 500%.The pattern was choppy and did not fit the definition of proper bases, such as the double bottom or cup with handle. Yet, the pattern had some positive elements and was labeled a \"consolidation\" in MarketSurge's pattern recognition tool. Think of it as a catchall term for appealing chart patterns that don't quite conform to proper base dimensions.So, what exactly is a \"consolidation\" pattern? It has to fit within certain criteria. In terms of base depth, the decline can be as much as 50%. Remember, if a decline is 15% or less it is more likely to be a flat base.In terms of time, a consolidation pattern takes at least six weeks to form long and have a maximum length of 65 weeks.MarketSurge chief Scott St. Clair told Investor's Business Daily that he looks for an alternate entry whenever possible in a chart identified as a consolidation. He pointed out the handle as an especially useful tool to find an entry point. A handle needs at least five days to form, but can go on for weeks. The decline from high to low should not exceed 12%.Nevertheless, the left-side high of the pattern can always be used as a buy point. To do this you simply add 10 cents onto that prior high.From late July 2018, Shopify stock entered into a long period of consolidation. An early attempt at forming a cup with handle failed. With three main dips, the pattern also was not a double bottom. It continued to whipsaw for months, but the decline from prior highs was a respectable 33%.In December 2018, it passed its buy point of 176.60 (1) as it enjoyed multiple up-weeks in a row. The stock's relative strength line also gave a clue that a price move was underway. It started spiking in late December, and made a new high when the stock broke out, a bullish sign (2).The breakout was given further momentum in mid-February 2019, after the company reported EPS growth of 73%, which led to buying in above-average volume. The stock ended up trading up for 10 weeks in a row, an impressive achievement.By the time the stock started to form what would become its next base in late August 2019, Shopify had turned in an impressive gain of almost 236%. Continued strong earnings aided the stock's progress. Those who chose to stand by the stock, holding it up to the current day, have made a handsome gain of more than 500%.This article was originally published Aug. 10, 2021, and has been updated.

        "content": "By Divya Rajagopal and Felix NjiniTORONTO (Reuters) -Barrick Gold will resume operations at its shuttered Loulo-Gounkoto mine in Mali once authorities in the country allow it to resume gold shipments, CEO Mark Bristow said on Wednesday.The Toronto-based miner said it has been assured by Mali that gold worth about $245 million seized by authorities still belongs to the company, Bristow told Reuters in Toronto. Mali and Barrick have been locked in a dispute since last October over implementation of the country's new mining code.The miner's shares rose as much as 6% on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning after it reported that its profit surged last year, buoyed by a rally in bullion prices. Barrick also announced a new $1 billion share buyback program.Tensions between Mali and Barrick, the country's largest investor, escalated when authorities detained four of the company's employees, issued an arrest warrant for Bristow and earlier this year seized gold stockpiled at Barrick's mine site.The government had earlier blocked Barrick's shipments from Loulo-Gounkoto before seizing the gold.\"We will start the operations as soon as we get approval to ship the gold and we need to ship the gold to pay anything to the government,\" Bristow said.He said that Barrick paid $460 million to the Mali government last year and would have contributed about $550 million to the nation's treasury this year if operations had not been suspended.Barrick lowered its gold output forecast this year to between 3.2 million ounces and 3.5 million ounces due to the temporary halt at the Mali mine.Mali's aggressive push for higher taxes and a bigger state shareholding in mining projects has soured ties with its mining investors. Gold output plunged 23% to 51 metric tons last year, the nation's mines ministry said.Both Mali and Barrick are losing out from the closure of Loulo-Gounkoto, Bristow said.\"So if you calculate that to per week... and every week we don't do this it hurts everyone,\" he said.Barrick has also filed for an international arbitration against Mali to find a resolution to the dispute.Despite the tension with authorities, Barrick still considers Mali a long-term investment destination, and wants to maintain a presence in the country, Bristow said.(Reporting by Divya Rajagopal; Writing by Felix Njini; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"

Their growth has also slowed sequentially.\"Reddit shares are down in part due to Daily Active Users missing expectations, but it's not the best reason for anyone to lose faith in the company,\" said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of briefings at eMarketer.\"If Reddit keeps expanding internationally and builds on its AI advantage, it could go from a promising upstart to a true digital advertising heavyweight.\"The company has been benefiting from AI deals with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI and its conversation placement ads, where brands can advertise directly into discussion threads within interest-based communities known as subreddits.That helped Reddit forecast first-quarter revenue of $360 million to $370 million, which was above an average estimate of $358.1 million.Referring to an opportunity of data licensing deals, Huffman said, \"we are still talking to some of the big players.\"Revenue rose 71% to $427.7 million during the fourth quarter, beating estimates of $405.3 million, owing to the holiday shopping season, when brands spend heavily to promote their products and services.

Now, I will turn it over to Kevin.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we reported fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This brought our full year organic revenue growth to 12%, which was in line with our latest 2024 guidance. 2024 was a year of strategic investment for Dexcom.And through these investments, we believe we enter 2025 in a stronger position to capitalize on our next wave of growth. To recap, over the past year, we broadened our commercial reach, launched new products that define the category, built greater scale, and advanced CGM reimbursement globally. Through this work, we continue to lead the biosensing market and have positioned ourselves to impact millions of more lives around the world. We ended 2024 with more than 2.8 million customers globally on our G-Series and D-Series products as demand for Dexcom CGM remains high.This represents an increase of approximately 25% to our global active customer base compared to 2023. This increase in customers was driven by momentum both in the category and through our improving execution in the field, which we're very excited about. This was evident in the U.S., where our sales force productivity metrics showed improvement in the fourth quarter. We have now grown our U.S.prescriber base by more than 50,000 over the past year. Through these new relationships, we've successfully broadened our presence within primary care and made early inroads with emerging CGM care points like maternal-fetal medicine. Importantly, across this growing physician base, we are also seeing prescribing depth improve. It often takes only a single Dexcom experience for a physician to recognize the potential to deliver better care with Dexcom CGM.As these new physicians now expand their use of Dexcom CGM across our practices, we've seen the impact to our new patient performance build from the strong third quarter finish that we described on our last call. This helped us achieve another quarter of record new customer starts. As discussed earlier in the year, we knew that the opportunity ahead was tremendous when expanding the U.S. sales force.With this focus on execution, we look to build upon our momentum in 2025 as we further cultivate these relationships and connect with the next leg of CGM prescribers. Our team is also helping many of these physicians navigate the evolving coverage landscape within diabetes care. In the past two years alone, reimbursement for CGM has significantly expanded as we've helped establish our clinical value well beyond insulin management. As many of you remember, a key milestone on this journey was the publication of our mobile randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated significantly improved outcomes beyond intensive insulin use.This data prompted clinical societies to update their standards of care and quickly led to widespread reimbursement for anyone on basal insulin. We are now seeing similar evidence build around the benefits of CGM regardless of where someone is in their diabetes journey. In fact, some data has shown even greater health outcomes for those non-insulin when the CGM is providing them real-time feedback on lifestyle decisions for the first time. There is also a growing economic argument for incorporating CGM earlier into care plans as this has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, specialty visits, and utilization of healthcare resources.As this comprehensive body of evidence continues to grow, payers have started to act. We recently shared that as of January 2025, two of the three largest PBMs now cover Dexcom CGM for anybody with diabetes. With these national formularies leading the way by the end of the year, Dexcom will have coverage for more than 5 million people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin in the U.S. For context, this is even larger than the type 2 basal reimbursement that came less than two years ago.And yet this only represents around 20% of the 25 million type 2 non-insulin lives with diabetes in the U.S. In 2025, we will be actively pursuing coverage for the remaining 20 million lives. To strengthen our case even more, we recently announced that we initiated a randomized controlled trial for people with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin and expect to complete enrollment soon. As we advance this important work to further expand coverage in the U.S., we have already significantly broadened access to the Dexcom technology with the launch of our over-the-counter product, Stelo.In line with our mission to empower people to take control of health, this product has allowed us to reach many more people. As we said at the JPMorgan Conference last month, more than 140,000 people were on Stelo in the first four months of the launch with demand spanning across the type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and health and wellness populations. Importantly, regardless of where someone is in their metabolic health journey, we're quickly enhancing Stelo to make it more personalized and drive greater engagement across our platform. Key to this will be Dexcom's proprietary generative AI technology, which was recently launched in its initial feature in Stelo and will become a key source of personalized content as we expand this functionality over time.We're also building on this experience through targeted partnerships that will consolidate multiple biomarkers into our platform. This includes our recently announced relationship with Oura, which will integrate Dexcom glucose data with vital sign, sleep, stress, heart health, and activity data from the Oura Ring to provide an even broader picture of health for our mutual customers. Overall, we've been thrilled by customer demand for Stelo in these initial months, and we're excited to build on this momentum as we enter 2025. We see an opportunity to further elevate this Stelo brand this year through product iteration, broad awareness campaigns and new distribution channels.This will include Stelo's upcoming introduction on the Amazon storefront, which we expect to be live in the coming weeks. Finally, we ended the year on a high note across our international business. We have spoken time and time again about the importance of building greater access. And our most recent international coverage wins have again served as a nice catalyst for our business.Most notably, early in the fourth quarter, we finalized basal coverage for our Dexcom ONE Plus system in France and saw a strong demand in the first quarter of its implementation. France is another great example of our ability to leverage our product portfolio to match the needs of each customer and reimbursement system. It has also proven to be on the forefront of type 2 CGM coverage as one of the only two international markets with broad basal coverage today. In fact, across many of our markets, even type 2 intensive coverage is in much earlier stages though we're seeing interest and reimbursement steadily build.As it does, we believe we're better positioned than at any time in our company's history to participate and lead growth in this category. As we look forward to 2025, there is a lot for us to be excited about. We remain in a unique position to help pioneer a fast-growing industry that has significant potential to broaden its impact. With that, I'll turn it over to Jereme.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial measures presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as the slide deck on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we reported worldwide revenue of $1.11 billion compared to $1.03 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing growth of 8% on both a reported basis and organic basis.As a reminder, our definition of organic revenue excludes the impact of foreign exchange, in addition to non-CGM revenue acquired or divested in the trailing 12 months. U.S. revenue totaled $803 million for the fourth quarter compared to $769 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of 4%. As Kevin mentioned, new customer demand has steadily built over the past two quarters as our sales force productivity metrics continue to improve.Rebate eligibility again negatively impacted our U.S. growth rate by several points in Q4 but we expect this impact to step down in the first quarter and then be minimal over the course of 2025. In the DME channel, our share remained stable during the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations based on the strengthening performance of our sales team. While channel mix again had the largest year-over-year impact to our revenue per customer in Q4, recent DME share trends should help this impact moderate over the course of 2025.International revenue grew 17% totaling $311 million in the fourth quarter. International organic revenue growth was 19% for the fourth quarter. Our international business accelerated for the second quarter in a row as new access wins and the expanded availability of G7 and Dexcom ONE Plus generated higher demand in many key markets. In addition to France, another nice win came in New Zealand, where we unlocked broader type 1 coverage and saw a similar uptick in demand.These are great examples of how each market is unique and at different stages of reimbursement development. As Kevin mentioned, we still see a long runway ahead to build much greater global access, even within our existing markets. Our fourth quarter gross profit was $661.2 million or 59.4% of revenue compared to 64.2% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter, our gross margin was negatively impacted by a $21 million noncash charge.The majority of this was related to inventory that our quality management system identified as being mishandled by one of our shipping partners. The remainder of this charge is related to new build configurations that lowered our production yield in the quarter. As a result of these disruptions, we are currently managing channel inventory tightly for the next few weeks. Our facilities are running at full capacity to rebuild optimal supply for our distribution partners, and we expect to have these levels back to normal by the end of the first quarter.This is why we have made the investment in capacity to manage their growth and scale opportunities. Operating expenses were $451.7 million for Q4 of 2024 compared to $421.1 million in Q4 of 2023. Operating income was $209.5 million or 18.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $242.7 million or 23.5% of revenue in the same quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $300.1 million or 27% of revenue for the fourth quarter compared to $321.5 million or 31.1% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023.Net income for the fourth quarter was $177.8 million or $0.45 per share. We remain in a great financial position, closing the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. This provides us significant flexibility to both support our organic growth opportunities and assess strategic uses of capital on an ongoing basis. Turning to 2025 guidance.As we stated last month, we anticipate total revenue to be $4.6 billion, representing growth of 14% for the year. This guidance assumes continued strong category growth, steady DME share new access wins internationally, broader distribution for Stelo, and several product advancements across our platform. We also expect to see U.S. revenue and volume growth converging as the year progresses as we lap some of the unique rebate and channel dynamics discussed earlier.From a margin perspective, we expect full year non-GAAP gross profit margin to be in the range of 64% to 65%. Non-GAAP operating profit margin to be approximately 21% and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 30%. Our guidance assumes gross margins will improve at least 200 basis points in 2025 as we convert more of our installed base to G7 and drive greater scale at our high-volume manufacturing facilities. It also assumes a second half launch of our 15-day G7 system, which we expect to provide greater gross margin leverage beyond 2025 as we convert more of our installed base to the 15-day system.With that, we can open up the call for Q&A. Sean?Sean Christensen -- Vice President, Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Jereme. In addition to Kevin and Jereme, we will also have Jake Leach, our chief operating officer, joining us for our question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time. and then reenter the queue if necessary.Abby, please provide the Q&A instructions.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Again, we kindly ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and come back, join the queue for follow-up. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.Your line is open.Larry Biegelsen -- AnalystGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the taking the question. Kevin, I wanted to start with the issues you identified on the Q2 call, the sales force issue and the DME issues. And Jereme gave some color in his prepared remarks.But I'd love to hear a little bit more from you on the status of each. It sounds like your share in the DME channel has stabilized. So, how are you thinking about those issues that negatively impacted '24 in '25? Thanks for taking the questions.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet, Larry. We've made great progress on those issues since we talked about them in the second quarter. We worked very hard with our DME partners to identify opportunities to improve and to grow. We've also worked with our sales team to make sure we consider all channels across all markets and have that dual benefit offered where we can.With respect to the U.S. sales force, Larry, what we've seen is this group that we brought on board has now become more productive. I mentioned earlier that we've added 50,000 prescribers over the course of the year. And what we're seeing now, when we initially expanded that group.We saw the prescriptions per healthcare professional come down. That number has come back up even though calling on more healthcare professionals now. So, we're seeing more productivity per prescriber even as we add more prescribers. So, that group is doing what we asked them to.And I think that's really supported by the fact that we've had record new starts each in the last two quarters. So, both those things are going very well for us right now.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.Jeff Johnson -- AnalystThank you. Good afternoon, guys. Jereme, you talked on the call about narrowing that kind of volume versus revenue gap in the U.S. that has been pretty wide here in the last couple of quarters.I mean if I just put some numbers on it, it seems like in the fourth quarter, that gap was maybe 16 points, 17 points. Again, I don't have the perfect volume estimates in my number, but 16 or 17 points that's down for maybe 20, 21 points, something like that in the third quarter. Where do you think that goes? You said it falls off into 1Q. Does it fall to low double digits, just that kind of volume versus revenue gap in the U.S.? And then as it further converges throughout the year, can you get that back into the single digits into the mid-single digits, just conceptually help us understand how to think about that gap between those U.S.volumes and the U.S. revenue growth? Thank you.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSure. Yes, and thanks for the question. It will certainly converge, and we talked -- as we walk through it, I'll try to walk through it. and the cadence over the course of the year.So, certainly, as we lap the rebate dynamic here in the first quarter, then I'll start to converge a little bit here in the second quarter. As you start to compare year-over-year channels as we start to get those channels stability, you'll start to see that converge as you move into the third and the fourth quarter. I mean as we get to the tail end of the year. And so, the amount that you would expect to see it come in, it starts to get much, much closer to the numbers that you quoted.We haven't given a specific number, but what we would say is the delta between volume and price. We've talked about our patient base being about 25% higher exiting the year. You've seen our growth numbers at 14% essentially as guide. And if you exclude Stelo from that, it's more like 12%.So, you can already see implied there that the numbers are coming in, if you just assume that the patient base continues to grow into next year. So, you're already seeing it, I'd expect similar gaps as you see us exiting Q4 as we lap the rebate channel in 1Q, but you're going to start to see that coming in more and more over the course of the year. We don't have a number specifically to give you at this point. But you're right, it will start to come closer and closer, especially as we exit 2025.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.Robbie Marcus -- AnalystGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Jereme, maybe to follow up on that. There's a lot of considerations on both the top line and down the P&L between 15-day sensor lapping of some of the headwinds on pricing, how should we think about cadence through the year? Obviously, the math points to a much stronger second half on a growth rate basis.But how should we think about cadence through the year and particularly first quarter as we set up expectations here? Thanks a lot.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSure. Yeah. And as you think about the first quarter -- I'll start with the first quarter and then we can get to the year. We talked a little bit about this at your conference actually, Robbie, about how the first quarter is going to look a little bit, similar to where historical sequential patterns had taken us.So, if you look at our best sequential Q1 relative to Q4 in the past few years, it was about a 9% sequential decline. We talked about at JPMorgan to be in about an 8% to 9% sequential decline. So, it actually looks a little bit better in terms of seasonality here into Q1, and we'd expect it to do that. Nothing has changed as our guidance.We'd still expect that. And then typical seasonality over the course of the year, it should look relatively similar. I say that knowing full well that 1 percentage point in a split, if you will, can create a few different points of growth. But what I would say is there's going to be a relatively stable cadence of improvement over the course of the year.Obviously, the comps in the back half of the year make it a little bit easier. So, you would imply that. But in terms of just thinking about how you progress through the course of the year, dollar-wise, the progress through the course of the year dollar-wise, should look pretty good and consistent with, I'd say, more normal years. Last year was a bit of a unique year for us.So, that will help you get cadence from that perspective. In terms of gross margin, typically, from Q4 to Q1, we step back a couple of hundred basis points. This quarter, we talked about Q4 being a little bit burdened by some one-time charges, we've quantified those. I would expect there to be a little bit of a step back from Q4 to Q1, if you adjust for those one-time items, it means Q1 will be a little bit ahead of Q4.If you don't adjust for those items, moving up over the course of the year. We've got to move through some of the Q1 dynamics as we move forward, which is going to include certainly working through some of the yields improvements, which you talked about in Q4. We'll work through a little bit of that in Q1. But as you move into the rest of the year, based on the volumes that we're moving through our Malaysia facility and really through our entire facilities, you're going to see that continue to improve, and we have clear line of sight to our standard costs and what those margins look like, really looking good as we exit the year.So, this is a year where you're going to see a lot of the benefit of scale really drive that margin. You'll see a little bit of a benefit in the back half of the year from 15 day as well. But the big driver is going to be even without 15 day. You're seeing us -- the scale and volume that's running through our facilities will certainly make that back of the half of the year look pretty good on a margin basis.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with UBS. Your line is open.Danielle Antalffy -- AnalystHey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on the strong end to the year. Just wanted to follow up on the comment around some of the type 2 coverage.I think two of the three largest PBMs are now covering for non-insulin using type 2. And Jereme, maybe this question is for you and how to think about -- I appreciate what you're saying for 2025 as far as revenue growth converging with volume growth, but as more of these non-insulin-using type 2 patients come online, how should we think about that? So, I guess this is more over the next few years. And will that diverge again before it reconverges or how do we think about that given that this is a less intensive patient population? I'm just trying to get a sense of what you guys are seeing from a pricing perspective from those. Thanks so much.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes, it's a good question. So, maybe I can put some clarity there. So, the unit economics of each purchase is actually similar across it. We don't necessarily have a different purchase price for a month of sensors between one disease state or another.So, type 1 and type 2 non-insulin using generally is at the same price point in our contracts. So, from that perspective, profitability-wise, you shouldn't see any impact there. Now I think in the models, the one thing you will have to be mindful of is when you look at a PMPY basis, our type 2 users typically don't use the product as often. They can go a weekend without it.There's lower retention utilization. Similar to what we disclosed at JPMorgan conference where we had our persistence and use of product there. So, I think from a modeling perspective, profitability-wise, I don't think you make any changes there. From a revenue per patient and just through your modeling on a per-year basis, I think you have to make those changes.And I think we've given the retention utilization data that's up on the website. So, that will be easy to at least model as you're moving through there. But good news there is I think you're kind of implying, hey, is there an impact on gross margin, operating margin, there isn't.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerNo, Danielle, I'd just add to that. When we have coverage with these type 2 patients, our retention and utilization rates are actually quite high. It's not like it's a one month and then and you're done. These patients that this product is reimbursed.We know they stay on that because they have such good outcomes. So, while the model may be slightly different in a reimbursed world, it's still very strong. There's very good utilization, very good patient retention.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open.Travis Steed -- AnalystHey, thanks for the question. Congrats. I just wanted to ask on the G7 15-day. I know you don't usually comment but wanted to see how the process the FDA is going.I guess the question is really like what's giving you the confidence to still say a second half launch here? And once you get that approval, how should we think about that process rolling out a couple of quarters before the patient base is kind of fully converted?Jake Leach -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating OfficerYeah. Thanks, Travis. This is Jake. Yes, the 15-day review, right, we mentioned that we submitted it on the last call.So, we're basically toward the tail end of that review. We've had a great interactive review with the FDA. We feel like right at the tail end because we basically have answered all the questions that they've asked us. And we do have the confidence that we're going to see an approval here shortly.As you kind of transition over to once we have approval, we do expect to launch that product in the second half of this year. really, it's about securing coverage. We want to get the 15-day product out as fast as possible, but we are mindful of the user experience. We've got to make sure we've got coverage in place.And we have to be mindful of our pump integrations as we launch this 15-day product. So, that's why we expect approval here shortly, but we'll get it out here in the second half of the year. We're also looking forward to presenting the 15-day clinical data at ATTD next month in Europe. So, that will be one of our lead investigators from that clinical trial is actually presenting the data.So, we look forward to sharing that with all of you next month.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citibank. Your line is open.Joanne Wuensch -- AnalystThank you very much for taking the questions. Briefly, what does it take to get the 15-day integrated with the pumps? Is that a difficult process? And I'm going to also ask, I think they've heard or seen on a slide, G8. Is there anything you can tell us about that? Thank you.Jake Leach -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating OfficerSure. Yes. So, the good news is pump integration with the 15-day sensor, we thought about that as we were doing the original G7 integrations. So, it is a much smaller lift than, for example, the difference between integrating as we moved it from G6 to G7.That was quite a big lift for our partners in terms of security interfaces and the Bluetooth interface. But as we look at the 15-day, there's -- most of it stays exactly the same the pump basically interrogates a sensor and the sensor tells us it's a 15 day. There is a little bit -- once we get approval, a little bit our pump partners have to do on validations, but we do anticipate it to be quite quick in terms of the integration with 15 days across our pump partner base. So, we'll be mindful as soon as they get those done, we'll be pushing the product out harder into the channels.But that's part of it. And then your question about G8 is we are very actively in the development process on G8. It will be our next hardware platform that we'll use across our portfolio of products. I won't go into all the details, but a couple of highlights are it's a smaller wearable with even more capability built into it.And we're looking toward compatibility with pumps much closer to launch of that product. We've learned a lot through our G7 integrations. And so, we're very excited about the progress on G8. It also has a multi-analyte capability built into it.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerI'd just add to that. We look at G8 also as a series of innovations. The jump from G6 to G7, we learned a lot because we changed pretty much everything. We're going to do this more step-wise, and we'll have literally a series of features leading to that configuration talking about where you get to multi-analytes somewhere down the road.So, we're looking forward to revealing more about this product platform as time goes on.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open.Matthew Taylor -- AnalystHi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I did want to ask one about the expanding coverage in terms of the PBMs now covering these lives and also thinking through to, hopefully, next year or the year after getting the non-intensive type 2 coverage. So, I just wanted to understand how you think about the additional lives being covered as a driver this year.Do you expect that group to show in the numbers? Is that contemplated in your guidance? And if you play through the study, when do you think you'll actually get more of an uptake in that noninsulin type 2 population?Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. I can take that. The expectation -- we've included it in our guidance.Now there are all sorts of levels of uptake. And as you can imagine, every model has the ups and downs associated with it. We're really bullish on the long-term nature of it. I think it's about us getting out there and letting folks know they have coverage.So, we're very mindful that there's education that we have to continue to do and the sales force is really excited about it. I know that the materials are now out there circulating in the field, and so we're excited about pushing those. That will be some of the work we do over the course of this year. The work to be done now is you talked a little bit about the PBMs.So, it's working with -- we have two PBMs. And as you go deeper into those PBMs and you get to more customized rise will be working with those PBMs to expand access even within their knowing full well the benefits that CGM provides to those populations. We'll also be working with the third PBM and looking at ways to ultimately gain coverage there. And so, we're hard at work there.And make no mistake, on the flip side, we are also looking at how we would work with CMS, certainly to make sure that folks have access to the product. We know the benefits of folks using CGM and what it does to the system. And given the capitated nature of Medicare fee-for-service and even Medicare Advantage plans, those are real interesting things, and so we'll be working heavily there. What you generally need in those cases, not all the time, but it's always helpful is an RCT.And as we've talked about in the past, we are running an RCT. Jake would tell you we're already in enrollment right now. And we've talked about really completing that enrollment here in the first half of this year with early readouts at the back end of this year. So, we'd be using that in conjunction with all of this evidence to look to expand coverage, but it is top of mind.So, as we have our market access team, potentially even listening to this call, they all know within the goals and the year is to make sure we advance this as much as we can.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.Matthew O'Brien -- AnalystI'm not sure if this is for Kevin or Jereme or Jake, for that matter. But are you expecting a record new patient number here in '25? And if so, can you just talk a little bit about the composition of where that's coming from, just given that we're getting a little bit more saturated on the intensive side and a lot more of this needs to come from basal and then not intensively managed type 2. So, just maybe talk about the proposition that gets you to that level, if you are committing to that? And just making investors or helping investors feel comfortable you can do that given this patient population that historically you haven't been as strong with. Thanks.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYeah, sure. I can give you some -- at least how we're thinking about the year. Certainly, we do expect it to be a record patient-year. We are -- we do see continued penetration across the insulin-intensive segment.And across T1 and T2 insulin intensive. We still expect quite a bit of penetration in that market, and it still plays a very large portion of our new patient starts. We do expect a consistent penetration in basal over the course of this year. And so, as you think about basal and the progress made across that population in 2024, I would expect something similar here in 2025.And so, that's continued steady adoption in basal. Remember, basal is a big grower since it's a smaller base as part of that population. It will continue to contribute there. And then, of course, we do expect greater contribution this year on the type 2 non-insulin side given some of the coverage that's in place.And so, it's continuing to move along basal. It's continuing to move along insulin coverage, as you've said, our insulin-intensive coverage with the addition of type 2 here. And what's interesting, and this doesn't include Stelo. So, I think what's important is this is in our G-Series and D-Series approach.And so, we're not even including Stelo in those numbers. And so, what should give you a little bit more confidence as we move even beyond type 2 and prediabetes and health and wellness, where we have an over-the-counter product like Stelo, that's just even more opportunity for us to take advantage of that. Kevin, do you have anything?Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerI would add, there's also some coverage wins that really start taking effect in 2025 in our U.S. markets with basal coverage in France. Some spotty growing basal coverage in Germany. We've had wins in Canada, Australia, we've got our direct team in Japan on the street now.So, we see international growth in those markets. I just kind of go along with what Jereme said. Now that we have more type 2 non-intensive open, obviously, that's going to contribute a larger portion of the new patients than we've done in the past because we have access to those people. But we still believe there's growth in the insulin population.I mean as I disclosed earlier with 60% penetration in type 1 and 55% penetration in type 2 intensive. We've still got a lot of people that need access to this technology to better control their health. And we believe with the field force their increased productivity and all the things we're doing, we're in a good place to get after it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open.Jayson Bedford -- AnalystGood afternoon. Excuse me, I apologize if this is redundant. But it sounds like there's no change to the Stelo expectation of 2% to 3% of sales. If you could confirm that great.But can you just also talk about the Stelo trend through the year, meaning specifically the timing of drivers, it sounds like Amazon is coming on soon. But when did the $5 million newly reimbursed come online? And when do you have full app integration with Oura? Thanks.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Maybe I'll start with some of that, and I can hand it off to Jake here. So, let's start with the type 2 coverage first so that we can move into Stelo. So, type 2 coverage that we announced effective 1/1.So, it's already in place right now. So, that's good news. We all -- I can also confirm that Stelo is 2% to 3%. The expectation is 2% to 3% of revenue in the year.So, we've obviously considered the type 2 coverage in making that call. In terms of the cadence over the year and the integrations and Amazon, maybe I can hand it to Jake just to cover some of the expectations around that.Jake Leach -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating OfficerSure, yeah. So, around Stelo, we're working fast and furious on a whole host of new capabilities. We actually just launched one within the past weeks that allows users to look back at their historic data within the app. So, that was something that was one of the No.1 request we got after we launched Stelo. And so, we've got that function out in the field. We are working, as you mentioned, very closely with Oura on a deeper integration today. We do import already or data into the Stelo platform.But working with the team over at Oura, we're working on a deeper integration where we have access to a lot more of the intrinsic data from the Oura platform. And so, we're working to integrate that into our app. So, the first thing we're working on right now is just the pipes to get the data flowing in, and then we'll start working on visualization. You will start to see those integrations coming out in the first half of this year.But we'll continue to -- we got two very innovative groups with the team over at Oura and our software team. And so, I'm really excited to see what they've been developing and will be throughout the course of the year, having multiple releases that continue to build on the functionality.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYeah. And then I think the last question is in channel. And so, channel, we are seeing DME channels selling it today. You're seeing partners selling it now.And I think the Amazon is expected in 1Q, Jayson. So, we expect to see it here in Amazon very, very shortly. And so, keep your eyes out. but 1Q is when we expect to launch.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.Shagun Singh -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystGreat, thank you so much. Kevin and Jereme, I was hoping you could walk us through some of the assumptions behind the 14% growth rate for 2025. It looks like there are some areas of conservatism. I don't think you see DME share gains, you're assuming it to be flat.Why is that? You do have easy comps? You guys typically guide mid-to high teens, but you tend to exceed those. You do have a fully productive sales force, more reps year over year two new product launches and then you are looking for a record new patient starts. So, can you walk me through that through the assumptions, should we assume the 14% growth as a base case? And then just on the 15-day sensor, what is assumed in that guidance for the second half? Thank you.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSure, yeah. I can give you some of the data points here. We covered a little bit on the script, but I think it's helpful just to walk through them. So, we do expect about 1 to 2 points to be growth related to Stelo.Obviously, if it was 1% last year and it's 2% to 3% this year, there's a couple of points there. As you peel that back, you'll see that the core, I'd say, G- and D-Series business is still in the low teens growth, 12%, 13%. And as you break down what happened in our international market, which we expect to continue to perform well in the U.S. market, you can see that the U.S.OUS market, we expect to grow a little faster than the U.S. market, at least in the guidance, and that's how we've set that up over the course of the year. But you still see the U.S. performance doing quite well over the course of the year.I would say what we've given you is the figures that we think is reasonable given the year. We understand that over the course of last year, we put a few things in place. Those have us take a bit of a step back. So, we want to make sure we put out some guidance that's very reasonable, that's very achievable.And that's what we've done here. To your point, there are some tailwinds in those assumptions. Kevin alluded to it earlier, there's access wins outside the U.S., and that's going to be very interesting. In the U.S., we have a sales force that's now up and stable and running, and it's wonderful to see.They've done a really great job. And so, really looking forward to some of that obviously, with more and more coverage wins coming out there in the U.S. over type 2. These are all things that are potential upsides.And if we can achieve those, we'll certainly pass them along. But I think we wanted to be reasonable when we put through that guidance. And certainly, it's an acceleration when you look at the back half of this year. As we exit the year, we had 3% and 8%.So, 14% would be a tailwind there. We do assume stable DME share. I think it's a prudent thing to do. We will be working closely with our DME partners.I think they've been wonderful through these past few weeks as we've navigated through this quarter, and I think they're great partners, and we'll look to continue to partner with them. But I think that's a reasonable assumption to take a start into the year.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd just add one other thing with respect to 15 days, yes, that's another tailwind. But again, we don't have an approved product yet. We've talked about launching this in the second half of the year. But there is a time frame where we have to get coverage up and running with all the payers, get it through CMS for Medicare and then get it on the shelves and also integrate with our partners.There's a time frame for a launch here. We learned a lot from the G7 launch, we'll apply these to 15 days. But make no mistake about it, there's a little bit of a lag. It takes a little bit of time.Well, a tailwind is going to be helpful. It's not the big tailwind. And there's certainly some upside if things were to go very quickly. But what we've assumed is a base case based on our knowledge and what we've experienced in the past.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Nephron Research. Your line is open.Christopher Pasquale -- AnalystThanks. I wanted to follow up on Stelo. You're coming off your first holiday season first New Year's resolution season with a consumer product. Did you see an acceleration in subscription activity tied to those seasonal factors? And now with a few months under your belt of the launch, how are you feeling about your ability to keep users engaged after they've gone through their first couple of sensors.And you mentioned AI, I would just love to hear a little bit more about what role that plays in that engagement.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerI'll start a bit and then let Jake take the question. We did see a nice spike of New Year's resolutions in January as the year started. And we saw a lot of people sign up to get the year started and kick things off. With respect to users continuing to use Stelo, our subscription renewal rate for those who signed up to subscription plans has been excellent.Users have signed up and they bought more sensors. We feel very good about that ironically, or not ironically, but just as a side note, the type 2 diabetes population in Stelo certainly signs up and buys more frequently than the others. And that renewal rate has been very, very strong. So, our initial design of that product, the way we thought the app would work is really serving the audience that we targeted for and then we'll add features over the course of the year that will benefit those users in addition to the other user groups that we serve.Jake, I'll let you take the AI stuff.Jake Leach -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating OfficerYeah, sir. So, we did roll out the first generative AI capability within a glucose biosensor on Stelo. And it was really around those insight reports that the users get after a week of weat. And it's good feedback.We actually did a staggered rollout of that. We rolled it out to half the users at first, and then we quickly ramped that up so we kind of compare some of the usage patterns. And so, I think one of the key areas that I talked about earlier when I said we've got a robust sequence of releases, a lot of it will be to continue to build on the insights. The number one thing now that we've got the historic data in the platform, the next request from users has been even deeper insights, which is clearly in our crosshairs as we look at the integration with Oura data and then the further utilization of that generative AI report and feedback.The insights are going to continue to get deeper and more personalized as we go and really looking forward to releasing more of that capability throughout the year.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.Steven Lichtman -- AnalystHi. Thanks, guys. Yes, just building on Stelo, at ADA last year, you talked purposely about focusing Stelo messaging on the non-insulin type 2 first. with the coverage making real progress here, how are you thinking about that messaging changing over the next couple of years and there be more of a bifurcation between G-Series for type 2 and Stelo for maybe prediabetes and beyond?Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerThat's a great question. It's something we discuss on a regular basis. We know that if products reimbursed, we have a much better chance of getting it to somebody and then staying out and using it all the time. So, what you're going to see is a migration of some of the features we put into Stelo geared toward type 2 patients not on insulin into the G-Series app.So, our users can have the opportunity to identify their glucose spikes and interact with G7 with the AI module and things like we put into the Stelo app. And conversely, you'll see Stelo will add more features. Again, that would be more conducive to health and wellness and serving other populations, pre-diabetes along those lines. But you'll see us migrate features from one app to the other where it makes a lot of sense.And that's a credit to our software team and the software platform we've built with our ability to iterate very quickly.Jake Leach -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating OfficerOne thing I'd add is that if you look at the indication for use on Stelo, it is very, very broad, and that was purposeful, and we went and pioneered the over-the-counter indication. It's all adults, not on insulin. So, it very much is indicated for use outside of diabetes. And we intend to, over time, continue to build the feature set out to serve more and more users.We actually have quite a few of the users that have been using Stelo to date are in that category of health and wellness and longevity, just seeking to learn more about their metabolic health through using this the system. So, we did target diabetes and prediabetes at first but clearly is the capability of the platform build out, it's going to become more and more applicable to a broader group.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Issie Kirby with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.Issie Kirby -- AnalystHi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the G8 sensor and how we should be thinking around potential accuracy improvements really going after MARD on the glucose monitoring side with this device. And then you've touched upon multi-analyte, what discussions are you having with payers about the ability to perhaps look at a premium price for a sensor with these capabilities? Thanks.Jake Leach -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating OfficerYeah. Thanks for the question. Yes. So, we are always striving to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our sensors.G7 is the most accurate sensor available, but there's still opportunities to enhance this technology and make it more accurate and more reliable for broader group of users. And so, even within the G7 platform, we're still working to further enhance the accuracy of that system. And so, as we look to G8, we're actually building -- one of the things I mentioned, right it's a smaller wearable, but with more capability. And part of that capability is further ability to -- for fault detection, as well as accuracy enhancements.And so, we will -- we do intend to improve the accuracy of the system as we continue to build on the different hardware platforms. The multi-analyte is we've got different analytes in various stages of development. There's actually quite a few. And so, we're kind of early days in terms of the use case applications and whether we haven't had a discussion around premium price yet, but the way that we think about it is amplifying the value of the CGM by adding those additional analytes and broader use cases and chronic diseases around diabetes is certainly one of the areas that we'll consider once we get the technology a little further along.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Michael Polark -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, good afternoon. I want to ask about the point estimate for the revenue guidance. Jereme, you have a history of providing a range of about 5 points in recent years. So, why just one number and not a range.If you had to think about a range around this 4.6% is 4.6% the floor, a midpoint? How would you frame that? I'd appreciate any color. Thank you.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSure, yeah. I mean the reason we went with a point and obviously, we went out in January at JPM and now again. As you know, last year was a bit of a unique year for us. I think what's really important is we set everybody with what our best thoughts are around the year.And so, this is our best thoughts around the year. We don't necessarily want to couch it as good, low, high, low, etc., because we'd be putting out a range again. And so, the best way to think about it is, is we really wanted to give everybody a thought about the year in the eyes of management after a year that I know that had some folks thrown for a bit of loops over the course of the year. So, we thought it was the right thing to do.And as the year moves on and as the year progresses, we'll certainly give you guys updates, but it was really just designed around that is making sure we got everybody on the same page with us and we'll hopefully move all forward together.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.Bill Plovanic -- Canaccord Genuity -- AnalystThanks for taking my question. I'm going to go to a different angle here. We've been talking about revenue a lot. I really want to talk about profitability if we can.Obviously, '24 was a tough year. we've really kind of tapped out of that 20-ish percent operating level. You're looking for a little increase in '25, how do we think about kind of the years after? Is this going to be something where it's a 1% expansion per year in operating adjusted operating? Or are there any lever points that could really accelerate this?Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSure. Thanks, Bill. Appreciate it. I think there's a couple of things.One, obviously, one of the big things that we've been focusing on is building a bunch of levers into the business on the operating expense side. I think you've seen it over the years. Opex as a percentage of revenue has continued to come down. I would expect that to take place over a few years.That all being said, we do allocate a significant amount of money to R&D, and that's intentional because of all the opportunities ahead of us. And so, we balanced this investment, reinvestment in the business across both R&D and sales and marketing because not only do we believe there's a lot of opportunities for development and growth. We also believe as we move into these new markets, there's a lot of opportunity to spread the word. And that's why we've invested in sales force expansion, it's why we invest in marketing.So, levers are, you can invest less in the business. I don't think that's what we really want to do. We are doing a wonderful job of managing G&A as an organization, and I think we'll continue to do that. So, that's where the leverage will come from.The other piece of leverage will come from gross margin. I mean we've guided out to 65 over the years. If you look in the past year, we came in obviously lower than that in 2024. So, I think as you think about gross margin, certainly getting back to 65%, and I think you guys all know the levers with 15-day and continuing to design cost out of the product, those are opportunities that obviously can head back to the bottom line over the years.So, I think those are the two levers to play with. And as long as there's an opportunity to continue to reinvest in the business, which we believe will drive long-term growth, we'll continue to do that. If that doesn't make sense, there's certainly leverage we can get in the P&L. I think, Bill, you know this from all the years you've done this, building levers is really important for our business.And some of those levers go into reinvestment and some of those levers will go back to return of investment. And those are the two things we're going to make sure we balance as we grow the company.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Patrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThanks for taking the question. Fifteen-day, again, so apologies about that, but it's obviously a big impact. I guess, how are you thinking long term about what the average wear time will do? Because presumably, there'll be a subset of patients who may want to change their sensor a little bit more frequently for all kinds of different reasons, whether it's how they react to adhesive or gets dirty or things like that. Do you have any inflo from like early days of Stelo to get a sense for change out rates? Or I'm just trying to think where does it ultimately end up? It's obviously not completely 15 days, but I'm just trying to get a sense of where you think the average consumer is going to end up.Thanks.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerActually, our Stelo wearers are very happy with the 15-day wear so far. And as far as them being unhappy with sticky tape or something not looking right? That really hasn't been that much of an issue. The number of patients getting to 15 days with Stelo has been very strong so far. Look, 15 days is the preferred use case for this patient population and for their caregivers.Certainly, there may be groups, for example, children where they may change more frequently. We have right now a very generous and a very yet efficient service model with the sensor fails or falls off. We work with people to make sure they have the sensors that they need. We're looking at that service model as we go to 15 days to make it as streamlined as possible.So, people do have the experiences that they want. At the same time, we increase our profitability and our margins across the way. And this is something we will look at and talk about on a regular basis, Patrick. But most people really do want to wear it 15 days if they can.They'd rather not change the sensor.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think it's safe to say. I mean in the interim, you're 100% right, Patrick, the timing is going to be, who moves when they move, what they preferred. Longer term, every one of them, they're all going to be 15. So, it's just a matter of timing as opposed to necessarily how many people are going to stay on a 10-day.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. Your line is open.Unknown speaker -- -- AnalystHey, good afternoon. This is Sam on for Marie. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe I can just ask about the sustainability of international growth? And just getting your thoughts about contribution from maybe the several levers you have, whether it's expanding into new markets, going direct in other countries and just increasing our penetration through coverage ones.Thanks.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerOur primary goal internationally, again, is to go to the large international markets where sensors are approved where CGM is approved and it's a growing technology. Certainly, there are countries in this group where there's more type 1 penetration to get. Many of the countries don't even cover type 2 intensive insulin use yet. So, we're looking to drive more access there.And then basal insulin, as I said earlier in the call, it was only fully approved in two OUS markets, Japan and France. So, we're looking to build the case in those markets. So, we'll expand in the markets where CGM has already a proven technology and becoming the standard of care for insulin use. As far as other markets, when we launched our Dexcom ONE product in the beginning.We built a very efficient model to launch a digital platform in those geographies and get those geographies up and running. While we've experienced in those geographies in all fairness is oftentimes it goes to reimbursement very quickly when the government sees how many of these sensors are purchased and the great outcomes these patients have as physicians put pressure on the reimbursement authorities. So, we have good plans for those geographies where we're not. That's not where the bulk of the international growth is going to come from.It's going to become from the large markets where CGM is reimbursed as we expand Dexcom access and the category in general, similar to what we've done in the domestic market.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Mike Kratky with Leerink. Your line is open.Mike Kratky -- Leerink Partners -- AnalystHi, everyone. Thanks for taking our question. You walked through some of the growth trends across the different segments of the diabetes population earlier on the call. Maybe as a follow-up to that, have you seen any noteworthy shifts in your market share that you're capturing across the different segments? And anything in particular you'd expect to see in 2025?Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean as you look at over the course call, say, the fourth quarter, we had a really good bounce back in the third quarter and a really strong fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter, given it was record new patients and we saw strength really across the board, we saw some good really good share performance across really all of it. Now the area we -- historically, we've had -- the lease share was in the area we haven't had coverage.And so, as you fast forward into 2025, coverage is a good opportunity for us there. And so, I'd expect us to continue to do well, especially with the expanded sales force and all of the innovation we're putting into the product, as well as having Stelo in the bag, and that's really important as we call them physicians. So, I expect us to do really well in the markets we're in. And then an area we alluded to a little bit earlier on the call, where we haven't had coverage, and we're excited to see where this goes in 2025 is in the non-insulin space.I think that's an area where, with coverage, we expect to perform well. But I think you saw the performance in Q4. The new patient performance in Q4 is a precursor to really some -- a good jumping point for 2025.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Barclays. Your line is open.Matt Miksic -- AnalystHey, thanks so much for taking the question. So, just one quick clarification and then a question on some of the comments you made about economics of patients. So, the quick clarification was just -- I'm not sure if you've given a time frame for yet, approximately? Is it one year away, two years away, that would be helpful. And then the question on the economics was I think the perception is among investors that as you move and call it, to the right, lower acuity patients noninsulin and so on that the economics and the economic value of that per patient is lower.And it sounds like on a per unit basis, I think as you were describing earlier, not true. So, is that purely driven by use case utilization, renewed prescriptions and so on? Or is there different rebates? Maybe how would you sort of like dispute that kind of perception out there about that segment of the market. Thanks so much.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerLet's start with your G8 question. We've not given a timeline. Right now, we're all hands-on deck for 15-day G7. And that's the timeline we're most concerned about today as far as giving you guidance again, that's in the second half of the year as we look forward to approval in the not-too-distant future.With respect to these other markets as we get into non-intensive diabetes treatment, even basal treatment when we started. We know that utilization rates among these patient groups are a bit different, but they're not as dramatically different as one would expect. Certainly, our type 1 patients who are on an insulin delivery systems, some of which don't even function without a sensor. The utilization there is going to be very, very high, obviously.And if they're having a good experience with their system, retention is incredibly strong as well. As we move down the acuity curve, what we see is utilization may decrease some, but as long as it's reimbursed, it doesn't decrease -- like it doesn't go from 90% down to 40%, it goes down a little bit. Then mind you, as we expand in these categories and get more and more users, utilization patterns will change, and they will shift. So, maybe the value of a patient over the course of the year will come down a little bit. But if it's reimbursed, we don't expect it to come down that much.Where we have to build out models and learn more with as we're still with these cash-pay patients, how many sensors are they going to purchase cash-wise? How many they're going to use and what does that look like? And we're too early in that journey to really define it.Jereme M. Sylvain -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes. And Matt, I think the question earlier was, do the economics per transaction change? I think the answer is no. However, does utilization change? The answer is yes. So, it gets back to the per user per year.it may come down. But remember, the amount of sensors you sell comes down because it's a utilization question. So, the gross margin and the op margins remain the same. I think that's the important part of it.So, it depends. Are you talking about the economics of the transaction or the economics of the lifetime value of the customer. they are different, but I think there was a question about does the margins go down because you're moving to a different, and the answer is no.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Kevin Sayer for closing remarks.Kevin Ronald Sayer -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive OfficerWe thank everybody for participating today. We're very pleased with our 2024 results and a record new patients and the things we achieved in the fourth quarter. We're looking forward to a great 2025, many levers in place for us to have a great year, and we look forward to your continued support.

        "content": "An ETF managed by YouTube financial personality Kevin Paffrath is closing, in part, after Paffrath bet that interest rates would continue falling, and he says, after overextending himself with real estate and other projects.The Meet Kevin Pricing Power ETF (PP), with $34.5 million in assets, will liquidate by Feb. 28, according to a statement from Tidal Financial Group, which issued the exchange-traded fund in November 2022 under its previous name Toroso.The fund, started with $500,000, performed well initially thanks partly to Paffraths ability to reach more than two million YouTube subscribers, as well as bets on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA) In a video posted Feb. 11, Paffrath said assets soared to around $50 million.After a September interest rate cut, Paffrath bet on falling interest rates. The Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bull 3X Shares (TMF), a high-risk fund that aims to provide outsized returns on bets on U.S. Treasury Bonds, replaced tech companies as PPs top holding with a nearly 16% allocation. Interest rates have climbed, crushing Paffraths bets.PPs price was unchanged over the past year, compared with a 22% gain in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).The father of seven, whose website lists his real estate companies and educational courses along with photos of him with a Tesla Cybertruck and a private jet, said in a tweet that he had overextended himself.I took on too much, he wrote on X, saying his priorities are his family, YouTube classes and his HouseHack business. I made a mistake expanding into too much too quickly.He said he lost a personal investment of around $1 million due to fees, lawyers and other costs associated with running the fund.Paffrath also cited interference from his partners without mentioning Tidal or other firms. He said the partners rules forbade him from doing things like boosting the size of his bets on Tesla, and they also didnt execute trades as quickly as he would have wanted.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "Francis Chung / Politico / Bloomberg via Getty ImagesStock futures were ricking lower in premarket trading Friday as investors readied for economic data releases and evaluated the latest tariff proposals.In the news: President Donald Trumps latest tariff announcement delayed implementation of reciprocal tariffs on foreign trading partners and sent stocks higher; U.S. retail sales are expected to decline in January after several months of strength; Airbnb (ABNB) shares soar as a busy earnings week wraps up; bitcoin (BTCUSD) moved higher after reports that GameStop (GME) would begin investing in cryptocurrencies.Here's what investors need to know today.Stock futures pointed lower in premarket trading as investors reviewed the latest announcement on tariffs and watched for more economic data. Futures trading associated with the S&P 500 was down after the benchmark index added 1% in the prior session to close just shy of an all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was lower by 0.3% after its advance yesterday put the blue-chip index near its own record high, while the tech-focused Nasdaq pointed lower after adding 1.5% on Thursday. Major market indexes were in position to post gains for the week. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note were around 4.5%, while oil and gold futures ticked higher.Stocks rose Thursday after Trump signed an executive order that delayed implementation of reciprocal tariffs on countries that have their own tariffs on U.S. goods. The order instructed agencies to review tariffs applied to U.S. exports in order to find how they could be evenly matched, with reports expected by April 1. Some had expected the announcement to go further toward actually implementing reciprocal tariffs, and some interpreted the news as a sign that tariffs on U.S. imports may not be as steep as originally thought, while also raising optimism that some tariffs on experts may be lowered. The move comes after Trump laid out new steel and aluminum tariffs earlier this week.U.S. retail sales are expected to contract in January when that data is released by the Census Bureau at 8:30 a.m. EST. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires forecasted that consumers would decrease their spending by 0.2%, down from the 0.4% increase registered in December. The latest economic data is expected as strong consumer spending has helped support growth, but showed signs of slowing in December. Investors are also watching for reports on industrial production and import prices.Airbnb (ABNB) shares surged 14% in premarket trading after the vacation rental app turned a profit in its quarterly report and grew its revenue by 12%. The report capped a busy week for corporate earnings, with Cisco (CSCO), Reddit (RDDT), GE HealthCare (GEHC) and Lyft (LYFT) among the companies to issue reports this week. Walmart (WMT) highlights next weeks corporate calendar, with Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), Carvana (CVNA) and Rivian (RIVN) also scheduled to report. Many of the most closely watched big companies have already announced results, but another big one is due this month: Nvidia (NVDA), on Feb. 26.Bitcoin traded around $97,000 as market watchers evaluated corporate developments related to cryptocurrency. Shares of meme stock GameStopjumped by more than 8% in premarket trading after CNBC reported that the video game retailer was considering making investments into cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) posted full-year 2024 revenue that was more than double the prior year's number. Its shares were lower premarket.Read the original article on Investopedia"

That still had the stock up 23.6% since the start of the weeka solid return, though less than the near 30% weekly gain seen earlier Friday, which would have marked the stock's best five-day stretch since 1987.Intel was one of the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500 last year, when shares lost 60% of their value and the storied American chipmaker was dropped from the blue-chip Dow. The company has struggled to keep up with competitors in the race to develop AI chips and has invested billions in an uncertain turnaround plan.Shares got a boost early this week when Vice President JD Vance, speaking at an AI conference in Paris, said the Trump administration would take steps to ensure AI chips are designed and manufactured in the U.S. Intels foundry business, which manufactures chips for third parties, could benefit from Trump forcing tech companies to fabricate their tech domestically. Intel Foundry was a big bet of former CEO Pat Gelsinger that lost more than $13 billion last year.The stock got another boost this week from speculation that Intel may partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), the worlds largest chip manufacturer and major Intel Foundry competitor, to fabricate chips in the U.S. and benefit from protectionist policies implemented by Trump and former president Joe Biden.Citi analysts on Thursday said they werent optimistic about the benefits of such an arrangement; in their view, Intel would struggle to adapt to TSMCs processes and working arrangements. We still believe Intel should exit foundry, they concluded.The TSMC rumor was just the latest in a series of rumored tie-ups. Qualcomm (QCOM) reportedly approached Intel last year to propose a takeover, and analysts have speculated that Broadcom (AVGO) could be interested in acquiring the company.UpdateFebruary 14, 2025: This article has been updated to reflect Intel's closing price Friday.

        "content": "The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD), coming off a solid year that included outperforming the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) by nearly 2 percentage points, continues to gain appeal among investors and financial advisors as the go-to strategy against a backdrop of high equity prices and geopolitical uncertainty.But a quick look past the precious metal to gold miners suggests an even more exciting ride for investors willing to buckle in for the ride.The $14.5 billion VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which gained 10.6% last year, trailed both SPYs 24.9% gain and GLDs 26.7% gain. But the early momentum in 2025 goes to the mining companies.GDX has gained 24.3% from the start of the year, compared to 3% for SPY and a still impressive 10.6% for GLD.According to etf.com data, GDX is on this run despite $1.1 billion worth of net outflows over the past month. The $81 billion GLD has had $650 million worth of outflows over the past month.Drew Martino, wealth manager at Savvy Advisors in Calabasas, California, attributed the rising price of gold to a confluence of factors occurring simultaneously.Among the factors is the Trump administrations ongoing tariff threats.Tariffs can lead to inflation, and tend to benefit gold, Martino said. Experts anticipate a slight increase in inflation in 2025 due to potential tariffs.On top of that, Martino pointed to mortgage rates coming off their 2023 highs as being favorable for gold prices.The price of gold closed at $2,945.40 an ounce Thursday, which is down slightly from the all-time high of $2,953 an ounce set Feb. 10.But the outlook remains bullish, according to Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital in Woodbridge, Connecticut.The current rally in gold and the (mining) stocks seems more pure than the last one because the stocks are leading, he said. In other words, when the stocks lead, investors are accepting more risk and not positioning as a defensive play.The bullish indicator, Schatz explained, is because mining companies are mostly levered to the metal so when stocks lead, investors think there is real demand versus hiding in gold for safety.Martino also sees the momentum continuing.Widespread belief in a gold price rise can lead to increased buying, further driving up the price, he said.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "After producing incredible returns for investors in 2023 and 2024, the stock market got off to a great start in 2025, as well. Since the start of the current bull market in October 2022, the S&P 500 index is up nearly 70%, as of this writing. Many growth stocks have seen their prices climb even faster.While many top growth stocks might look overvalued at this point, there are still plenty of great opportunities in the market. Finding those opportunities requires diligence and a willingness to look at some beaten-down stocks that still present great long-term growth prospects. To get you started, the following three growth stocks look like no-brainer buys right now if you have $100 to invest.You might not think a company that grew revenue just 7% in 2024 would count as a growth stock, but PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), an early pioneer in internet payment processing, is currently undergoing a transition. Management is culling unprofitable products and segments to build a more profitable business in the future. While that's weighed on the company's revenue growth, it also shows up positively in important metrics, like its transaction margin.2024 saw a strong recovery in earnings per share and free cash flow, up 21% and 60%, respectively. Management expects the transition period to continue weighing on results in 2025, though, and sees single-digit growth for revenue, earnings, and free cash flow for the full year.But the short-term transition gives long-term investors a great opportunity to buy shares now at a discount. PayPal is still the leading payments network on the internet, fostering its two-sided network of merchants and consumers. That gives it a significant competitive advantage, enabling it to win more merchants and, in turn, drive more consumers to sign up for its digital wallet.Shares trade for around $76, just over 15 times management's 2025 earnings-per-share (EPS) guidance, as of this writing. That's an incredibly low price for the stock.As management focuses on improved profitability, steady revenue growth and margin expansion should result in good net income growth. Combined with management's focus on repurchasing shares, it should produce very good EPS growth over the next few years.Uber (NYSE: UBER) is the largest rideshare and delivery marketplace in the world, and that position has enabled it to grow faster than the competition. The company added 21 million new users on its platform in 2024, up 14% for the full year. Its size is a key advantage, as a large customer base attracts more drivers and restaurants, which, in turn, improves the customer experience with shorter wait times and more selections.Uber is growing the number of trips its users take, the revenue they generate, and most importantly, its profits. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved 60% in 2024 to $6.5 billion, and free cash flow grew 105% to $6.9 billion.Management sees a lot more earnings growth coming in the future. Its three-year outlook called for average free-cash-flow growth of 90%+ per year between 2024 and 2026. That could enable it to return cash to shareholders or make strategic acquisitions.The biggest threat investors see to Uber is the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, Uber sits in a great position as it presents the easiest path for AV makers to enter a market.It already has a massive consumer base and can enable AV makers to put a fleet into use quickly and efficiently with minimal downtime for their vehicles. It's no surprise that leading AV makers have already partnered with Uber to launch in several cities in 2025.Shares trade for around $77, just under 32 times forward earnings and about 24 times trailing free cash flow. For a company that's growing as fast as Uber, that's a fair price to pay.Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) is another company in the middle of a transition. It had been growing very quickly, leading it to sign a distribution agreement with PepsiCo in 2022. That pushed it to new heights in 2023, but the company ran out of energy in 2024. PepsiCo adjusted its inventory levels last year, leading to sluggish revenue growth for Celsius.The company saw a massive revenue decline in the third quarter, down 31% year over year and 33% in North America alone. That's due to Pepsi's lack of buying, along with softness in the overall market. But it's worth pointing out that Celsius' international sales continue to grow quickly, up 37% in the quarter and 36% for the first nine months of the year. International still accounts for just a tiny portion of the company's overall results.The future looks positive for Celsius as it manages through this transition with PepsiCo. It's seen strong sales in other channels, including Amazon and Costco. Its acquisition of Big Beverage to bring manufacturing in-house should help improve margins over the long run and give it more operating leverage.With a price around $22 per share, the stock trades for 23 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2025 earnings. The analysts covering it on Wall Street think that's an incredible deal on the stock as it navigates this transition.The lowest price target among analysts following the company is $26 with a median price target of $38. With all of Wall Street in agreement that the stock is underpriced, it's a no-brainer to buy.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) is an up-and-coming electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer with significant backing from the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund. The company, which focuses on luxury EVs with extended driving ranges, has drawn investor interest since its merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) three years ago.The company aims to compete with industry giant Tesla with its premium offerings. However, it has struggled to ramp up production and meet the aggressive targets laid out a few years ago when it went public. The stock reached as high as $57 per share in 2021, but is now down 95%.Lucid has had to tap into equity markets several times and continues to bleed cash. However, the company is optimistic that its newer models can help improve margins and reach profitability. If you're considering owning Lucid Group stock, here are some things to consider first.Lucid Group's luxury electric cars target a more affluent customer demographic, and the company aims to establish itself as a premium automotive brand.One element that makes Lucid's offerings stand out is the range of its vehicles. Its flagship model, the Lucid Air Pure ($69,900), attracts customers looking for range and practicality. The car offers 430 horsepower and an impressive driving range of 420 miles per charge. For those seeking higher performance, its Grand Touring model ($110,900) delivers an impressive 819 horsepower and an even greater driving range of 512 miles.In addition, Lucid recently launched its long-awaited SUV model, the Lucid Gravity Grand Touring, in early November and has begun taking orders for the vehicle, priced at $94,900. It promises 450 miles on a single charge and has fast-charging capabilities to charge up to 200 miles in only 12 minutes, addressing consumers' primary concerns around EVs. The company has begun production on this model and expects to begin deliveries sometime later this year.According to estimates from Motor Intelligence, the company sold a record 780 units in December and a solid 665 units in January, which represented a 51% increase in sales year over year. January sales included 615 of its Air sedans and another 50 Gravity SUVs.Lucid's technology is impressive, and its focus on luxury and performance makes it an intriguing stock for EV investors to consider. It is also seeing positive momentum, with sales growing every month from September through December. The company also has substantial support from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which will help it grow.However, there are some risks for investors to consider first.Last year was solid for Lucid, as the company produced 9,029 vehicles and delivered 10,241 vehicles. However, the biggest issue is that this has failed to live up to management's lofty expectations laid out when it first went public in 2021.At that time, management projected Lucid would deliver 49,000 vehicles in 2023 and another 90,000 in 2024. Instead, the luxury EV maker has delivered a fraction of that amount, showing how difficult and costly it can be for up-and-coming companies to ramp up production on a wide scale.Through the first three quarters of last year, Lucid's revenue grew a solid 31% to $573 million. However, expenses continue to be a primary point of concern. Over that same period, expenses came in around $2.9 billion, and the company's operating loss was a staggering $2.3 billion.As a pre-profit company, Lucid has had to spend significantly on research and development and ramping up its production capabilities. Because of the high costs, funding is crucial for Lucid's ongoing growth and long-term success. The EV maker has had to raise capital numerous times from outside investors, including capital raises through public equity offerings and additional investments from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.Last October, Lucid raised another $719 million by selling 262.5 million shares priced at around $2.66 per share. The PIF invested another $1 billion in Lucid, bringing the PIF's total investment in Lucid since 2018 to $8.9 billion. The move provides Lucid with enough funding for a financial runway through 2026, but those capital raises have significantly diluted longtime shareholders in the process.Lucid Group is pushing EV technology forward with its combination of power and range. The company may be able to benefit from long-term tailwinds for EVs. According to projections from consulting firm PwC, the number of EVs in the U.S. could reach 27 million by 2030 and 92 million by 2040. If Lucid can gain its footing and generate positive cash flows, it has an opportunity to be a formidable player in this industry.The EV maker has taken steps to rein in costs, but has also required further investments from equity offerings and the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund to keep things going. While it has the cash runway to fund its business well into 2026, I want to see it improve its production numbers and bottom-line results. Until then, investors should avoid or sell the stock until more positive results become visible.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Shares of S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) rallied sharply following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street estimates. For the period ended Dec. 31., the financial services intelligence giant posted a 14% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was up 20% to $3.77. If shareholders needed further good news, the company offered a strong outlook for the year ahead alongside a new share buyback authorization.The trends are solid, but considering the stock is up 24% over the past year and currently trading at an all-time high, can the rally keep going? Let's discuss whether S&P Global stock is a buy now.S&P Global is recognized as a leader in financial analytics, including credit ratings, investment research, and index data. A resilient economic environment, coupled with positive investor sentiment toward capital markets, has been a tailwind for its business.A key performance indicator highlighting the operating momentum is the billed issuance, reflecting the value of credit instruments rated. The figure reached a record $3.9 trillion in 2024, up 54% from the previous year, capturing favorable market conditions between tight credit spreads and lower interest rates.Within the 31% year-over-year revenue growth contribution from ratings in 2024, an important dynamic is the ongoing diversification beyond the traditional focus on investment-grade and high-yield debt into other types of loans and structured products. This category generated a 62% increase in revenue compared to last year.S&P Global is also seeing a strong response to its new offerings, referred to as its Vitality Index. In this case, products like the CARFAX Car Listings data tracker, Energy Transition intelligence, and LNG Price Assessments insight have gained traction.Another major development for S&P Global has been its effort to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) functionality across its ecosystem. The initiative includes the Spark Assist generative AI co-pilot, which aims to enhance user productivity and the platform's value proposition.Management comments have projected optimism that these recent innovations have positioned the company for durable, profitable growth. For 2025, the company is guiding for revenue growth between 5% and 7% against the particularly strong 2024 growth rate benchmark. The company's adjusted EPS target range of $17.00 to $17.25 represents a 9% increase at the midpoint from the $15.70 result in the previous year.Metric20242025 EstimateRevenue growth (YOY)14%5% to 7%Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)$15.70$17.00 to $17.25Adjusted EPS growth (YOY)25%8% to 10%Data source: S&P Global.The attraction of S&P Global stock as a potential investment opportunity starts with an understanding that many of its data products and credit ratings coverage are often critical in the daily operations of its customer base. Institutional investors, banks, and asset managers rely on the specialized market intelligence from S&P Global, forming an ingrained and mutually beneficial commercial relationship.The company's financial profile, defined by steady cash flows and high-quality earnings given historically strong contract renewal rates, helps justify a premium valuation. Shares of S&P Global are trading at 31 times its 2025 EPS estimate as a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Notably, this level is at a modest discount to industry competitors like Moody's and MSCI that offer alternative solutions, trading at forward P/E ratios of 37 and 34, respectively. By this measure, S&P Global offers relatively good value, with a key advantage being its larger size and more diversified platform.S&P Global also stands out as a \"Dividend King,\" with an impressive 52-year history of increasing its dividend payment. The current quarterly rate of $0.96 per share yields 0.7%, which is coupled with a $4.3 billion share repurchasing authorization as part of the company's commitment to reward shareholders.I'm bullish on shares of S&P Global going into 2025. Through its exposure to the broader themes of the financial services sector, as long as capital markets remain buoyed with low volatility and a steady rise in asset prices, the company is on track to achieve its earnings targets. Investors confident in the company's ability to consolidate market share have plenty of reasons to buy and hold S&P Global stock for the long run.Before you buy stock in S&P Global, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and S&P Global wasnt one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, youd have $850,946!*Now, its worth noting Stock Advisors total average return is 959%  a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

US stocks have posted annualized returns of 10.3% from 1994 through the end of 2023. A $10,000 investment in the market 30 years ago would have grown to $200,000 by 2023. However, missing out on just the 10 best days of the market during this period would mean $108,000 in lost returns.That's why staying invested in the market despite its volatility is the key.

I first got into investing in the late 1990s,\" he said.The investor also advised to always have a plan for downside protection.\"One of the most important things in investing (not gambling) is to have both a downside and upside strategy. For my downside strategy, it is simple  if I lose ~15-20% of my original investment dollars, I am out and ask what did I miss or were there any over-riding events (war, terrorism, ..). I will continue to watch but rarely do I average down as I view this as throwing good money after bad.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC), the famed telemedicine specialist that rose to prominence in the early pandemic years, is not performing nearly as well as it once did. Over the past three years, the company's financial results have been disappointing -- at best -- and its stock price has plummeted.Is the market too pessimistic about the telehealth company's prospects? Teladoc's shares could be a steal at current levels if that's the case. Let's find out whether it's worth investing in the company today.First, it is worth pointing out exactly what has happened to Teladoc since 2022. True, the initial tailwind it experienced in 2020 due to government-imposed lockdown orders was never going to last, but there is more to the story. Teladoc faced stiff competition from which it could not meaningfully differentiate itself due to a lack of a competitive advantage. Telemedicine is extremely convenient: It offers basic medical care from the comfort of one's home.Many other companies also wanted a piece of that pie. Consider Teladoc's BetterHelp segment, a virtual therapy unit that was once its biggest growth driver. Even with the rise in mental health issues we experienced during the outbreak, other virtual care providers took significant market share in this niche, undercutting Teladoc's efforts. So, the company's revenue growth within BetterHelp (and elsewhere) slowed considerably.Further, Teladoc remains unprofitable. What's more, the company incurred significant losses along the way, although those were sometimes due to impairment charges. The inability to grow its revenue at a good clip while turning red on the bottom line is a bad combination for any company.The good news for Teladoc is that the telemedicine market likely hasn't peaked. Analysts continue to predict that this space will grow at a good clip through the end of the decade and likely well beyond that. Telehealth isn't just convenient. It can help cut overhead costs, which are then passed on to customers. Consider BetterHelp again, a virtual service allowing therapists to practice from their homes instead of renting expensive office spaces.BetterHelp offers competitive prices partly for this reason. So, the industry is on a growth path. The question is whether Teladoc can carve out a niche for itself that will allow it to grow revenue at a good rate and become profitable. Here is how the company could do it.First, there remains a massive opportunity for Teladoc to cross-sell its products to existing clients. The company's general medical service, integrated care, ended the third quarter with 93.9 million members in the U.S., an increase of 4% year over year.That's a massive ecosystem of patients, the overwhelming majority of whom aren't using its other services. Patients on BetterHelp and chronic care enrollment were 398,000 and 1.2 million, respectively, as of the third quarter. If Teladoc can make significant progress here, the company's total visits and revenue will increase meaningfully.Second, Teladoc could ramp up its international expansion plans. The company's international revenue accounts for a decent percentage of total revenue and is growing faster. In the third quarter, international revenue came in at $104.3 million, 15% higher than the year-ago period. Teladoc's total top line declined 3% year over year to $640.5 million. If the company can maintain this momentum in international markets, that could lift top-line growth.Third, Teladoc is looking to get insurance coverage for BetterHelp, which would be a meaningful boost that will likely attract many more patients to the platform and increase its revenue.Teladoc's shares recently jumped after Citron Research, an online investment newsletter, claimed the market is not fairly valuing the telehealth company given its increasing free cash flow, investments in technology (including artificial intelligence), and efforts to cut costs. Teladoc currently trades at 10.6 times trailing free cash flow, which does seem reasonable.TDOC Price to Free Cash Flow data by YChartsHowever, in my view, and despite Citron Research's rave reviews, Teladoc still has a lot of work to do to become an attractive stock. It's cheap right now, because it has not performed well recently and doesn't yet have a clear path to profitability. Corporations with far more attractive prospects command higher valuations. Teladoc's initiatives could pay off and turn the company into an attractive stock again, but it's not clear that this will happen.Will BetterHelp secure coverage? Will the company succeed in cross-selling products when it has failed to do so in the past few years? Will it be able to keep costs down as it ramps up international expansion efforts? Until Teladoc can address these (and other) concerns, only investors comfortable with risk and volatility should consider buying the company's shares.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Dividend investors are often looking for income to replace a salary in retirement. Buying companies that pay dividends monthly is a great solution, as monthly dividends are as close to a paycheck as you can probably get on Wall Street.But is it worth reaching for yield with a stock like EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR), which has a 7.1% dividend yield? Or is it better to play it safe with the 4.3% yield that is on offer from fellow real estate investment trust (REIT) STAG Industrial (NYSE: STAG)?EPR Properties used to be known as Entertainment Properties Trust, which better illuminates the types of properties the REIT owns. Essentially, EPR invests in assets that are meant to bring consumers together into group settings. That includes places like amusement parks, movie theaters, and ski resorts, among many other types of properties. This unique focus is expected to help protect EPR's business from the ongoing transition toward digital life, notably on the retail side of the equation.That said, bringing consumers together into group settings was a terrible focus to have during the coronavirus pandemic. Such businesses were often shut down because they weren't considered necessities. EPR suspended its dividend for about a year to ensure it had enough liquidity to survive and help its customers survive through the pandemic.The dividend is now back, at a lower level, and growing again. So it did indeed survive, but it is still trying to work itself back into fighting shape.The big story here is that just over a third of the REIT's rent roll is tied to movie theaters. That business is weaker today than it was prior to the pandemic, with a rent coverage ratio of 1.5x compared to 1.7x in 2019. That said, the rest of EPR's business is stronger, with rent coverage of 2.6x compared to 2.0x in 2019. And, notably, management has been actively reducing its exposure to movie theaters.In other words, it looks like overall, EPR is moving in the right direction. But there's a cost. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO) fell year over year through the first nine months of 2024 and will likely be notably lower for the full year. Even though the adjusted FFO payout ratio was a solid 66% in the third quarter, leaving ample room to deal with adversity, it seems that investors aren't pleased with the turnaround that is taking shape, given the high yield on offer here.STAG is a bit more boring. The REIT buys industrial assets and uses a net lease approach, which means its tenants pay for most property-level operating costs. The industrial assets it buys tend to be vital to the businesses that occupy them, and include properties like manufacturing and distribution facilities. Although as it has grown STAG has reached into larger markets, it has a penchant for buying in second-tier markets where competition is lower and it has advantages over what competition there is, which is often smaller landlords.STAG is a relatively young REIT, but at this point, it has increased its dividend annually for over a decade. The pace of dividend growth has been slow, with a 10-year annualized growth rate of just under 2%. But that, in the end, is better than what investors wound up with if they had bought EPR Properties and suffered through the dividend suspension.Still, slow and steady, perhaps tortoise-like, is the story that backs an investment in STAG. It won't excite you, but it should keep paying you to stick around.If you need to ensure you have a reliable income stream to pay your bills, you will probably be better off going with STAG. Yes, it means you'll get less income. But the business has proven to be more consistent over time, and the portfolio isn't troublingly overweight in a risky property type. Indeed, only more aggressive investors will want to venture into EPR to collect its higher yield.That said, EPR is doing the right things to turn its business around, even though it isn't done with that turnaround yet. If you can accept the risk that this poses to your income stream, it might be worth it. But that's only true if you recognize that EPR's portfolio is still a work in progress, and that you'll need to monitor the REIT very closely.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Robotics is something that is transforming many industries -- and one of the biggest winners is the area of healthcare. Using robots in minimally invasive surgeries has been shown to decrease chances of complications, shorten hospital stays, and lower mortality rates. And one player in particular dominates this market, growing its system installation base, procedure volume, and revenue in the double digits in the most recent quarter.I'm talking about Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), a company that sells the world's leading surgical system: the da Vinci. The stock has delivered both over the long term and in the near term, gaining nearly 200% over five years and advancing about 13% this year so far. And from here, there's still plenty of room to run.Let's take a closer look at Intuitive and discover why it's the ultimate healthcare robotics stock to buy with $600 right now.As mentioned, Intuitive is the maker of the da Vinci, a robotics system used for many minimally invasive procedures, from hernia repair to hysterectomy and gastric bypass surgeries, just to name a few.The latest version, the da Vinci 5, has been used for more than 40 different procedure types so far. This model holds 10,000 times the computing power of the company's da Vinci Xi and offers surgeons greater autonomy and advanced data analytics capabilities. Intuitive recently launched the da Vinci 5 and continues to sell a variety of da Vinci models -- including the Xi -- to serve the various needs of hospitals and surgeons.Two things in particular stand out, ensuring Intuitive's dominance in the market and ongoing revenue growth potential. The first is the company's solid moat, or competitive advantage. A da Vinci robot represents an investment of more than $1 million for a hospital, meaning these buyers likely will aim to amortize the purchase over time -- so won't easily switch to a rival system.To further reinforce this, surgeons generally train on da Vinci robots, so they probably favor using these systems instead of learning to use an entirely new platform. This means they'll back the idea of sticking with the da Vinci.The second major strength of Intuitive is how it generates revenue. The company actually doesn't make the lion's share of its revenue through the sales of da Vinci robots. Instead, it brings in most of its revenue through the sales of accessories and instruments needed for each procedure. This is fantastic because it means that the more hospitals use their robotic systems, the more revenue Intuitive can generate. It also ensures that the company's revenue growth doesn't end when a hospital purchases or leases a system -- in fact, the revenue growth opportunity is just getting started.For example, in the recent quarter, Intuitive brought in $654 million from systems placements and more than $1.4 billion from the sales of instruments and accessories. All this has translated into steady earnings growth over time and recurrent revenue. Last year, 84% of the $8.4 billion in revenue was recurring, the company said.And the latest figures offer us reason to be optimistic about potential sales growth ahead. In the latest quarter, Intuitive placed 493 da Vinci systems -- compared with 415 in the year-earlier period -- and of those placements, 174 were da Vinci 5 robots.Now, let's consider valuation. Intuitive stock, trading for about 70x forward earnings estimates, isn't cheap. But the company's market leadership, solid moat, and recurring revenue make it worth the premium. Intuitive has proven its ability to grow earnings over time -- and the stock price has followed, delivering gains to investors. So, I wouldn't let the current valuation stop me from buying this stock.Instead, I would focus on Intuitive's performance so far and future prospects, as well as its financial stability -- the company finished the recent quarter with more than $8.8 billion in cash. And with these points in mind, Intuitive looks like the ultimate healthcare robotics company to buy now with $600 and hold on to for the long term.Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intuitive Surgical wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.The trend of institutional funds and big investment groups buying large tranches of single-family homes has been blamed for exacerbating America's housing affordability crisis. Some states, such as California and New York, have even introduced legislation that would curb or outlaw the practice entirely. Now, Wall Street investors are exiting the market, and a recent study shows this could have a reverse boomerang effect that leaves many American homes overvalued by as much as 35%.This could create a financial nightmare for millions of American homeowners, whose net worth is often tied to their home's value. The Wall Street Journal reported that real estate analytics firm Green Street reached those conclusions after analyzing the property portfolios of some of America's biggest landlords.Don't Miss:Arrived Home's Private Credit Funds has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate  This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!It revealed a huge disparity between stock prices for some of America's biggest single-family rental landlords, like Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) and American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH), and their net asset values, the report said.The analysis shows that the value of Invitation Homes shares translates to home values of around $310,000 in areas where the home's \"current market values\" are around $415,000. That large disparity is a cause for concern among Green Street's analysts. The firm's managing director, John Pawlawski, told The Journal, \"Share prices are signaling that single-family-home prices are too high and not sustainable.\"It's long been speculated that the tremendous buying power of institutional investors, who are known to buy hundreds of homes in single markets at once, is one of the main contributing factors to America's housing affordability crisis. Their simultaneous exit from the market en masse could slow property appreciation rates in many of America's biggest real estate markets.Trending: Many dont know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment  Heres how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big moveDuring their more aggressive buying sprees, institutional landlords relied on deep pockets and lower interest rates to muscle their way into the real estate market, much to the chagrin of first-time buyers who couldn't compete. Meanwhile, those already fortunate enough to be homeowners reaped benefits in the form of faster appreciation.However, that accelerated appreciation and the post-COVID run-up in interest rates appear to have changed the equation for many institutional landlords. Most institutional landlords target capitalization rates between 5% to 6% to generate passive income for investors, but current home values and interest rates are putting potential returns in the 4% range. That may explain why they slowed their buying down in Q3 2024.See Also: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAssets free tool matches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.The downstream effect of a once abundant source of capital suddenly being removed from the market is that sellers and developers can no longer rely on big-pocketed investors to take on huge chunks of housing inventory all at once. That will likely lead to homes staying on the market longer and selling for less, which would inevitably eat into current home valuations when appraisers find cheaper comps in various real estate markets.Who wins and who loses in Green Street's scenario depends on your place in the real estate market. Would-be buyers will likely cheer the potential price reductions. However, homeowners may lament the continued absence of institutional landlords if Green Street's analysis is accurate, and their properties are overvalued by 35%.Read Next:This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!This article Homeowners Beware: Wall Street Analysts Think Your Property Could Be Overvalued By Almost 40% originally appeared on Benzinga.com 2025 Benzinga.com.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has become one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street, rising around 170% since the start of November 2024. However, it's well off the peaks of its huge run, as it was up nearly 400% at the end of December.With SoundHound shares down more than 40% from their all-time high, many investors may wonder whether this stock could be primed for another huge run. Some may even consider this stock a ticket to becoming a millionaire.So, does this stock have the capability to do it? After all, one other artificial intelligence (AI) stock has already made many investors millionaires.Becoming a millionaire from one stock pick may seem like a far-fetched dream to some people, but it is entirely possible. If you invested $10,000 in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock a decade ago, you would now have $2.55 million, as long as you held on and never sold.Is it possible that SoundHound could have that kind of upside? Let's take a look.SoundHound AI's software is all about audio recognition and using that input for an AI model. Most of the generative AI models we've interacted with so far use text inputs. However, users must have access to a keyboard for this to work. That's not always a practical application.Some customers may prefer talking to a voice (think of a drive-thru at a restaurant) or need to probe an AI assistant while driving (even if the car is fully self-driving, do you really want a keyboard in the vehicle?). This is where SoundHound's technology comes in, and it has already landed some big clients.SoundHound's software has already been integrated into Stellantis vehicles in Europe and Japan. This is a massive auto brand, and if this technology becomes a hit, it's very likely that other automakers will partner with SoundHound as well. Many restaurants have also partnered with SoundHound to deploy its technology to integrate AI in drive-thrus and online order-taking.All this has allowed SoundHound to develop a diversified revenue stream, where none of the sectors in its business (automotive, restaurants, financial services, healthcare, and insurance) makes up more than 25% of the total. That's a key improvement, as 72% of revenue came from one client in the automotive sector during last year's third quarter (presumably Stellantis).SoundHound also has huge growth aspirations. It expects revenue to double in 2024, and to double again in 2025, with preliminary guidance coming in at $165 million in sales (compared to $83 million in 2024). That's massive growth, and it also sees fantastic revenue growth beyond that point.A company's booking backlog describes the value remaining on current contracts it has signed. While this is not guaranteed revenue, it gives investors an idea of how much growth they can expect moving forward. SoundHound's backlog now exceeds $1 billion and is spread out over a six-year timeframe. That's strong projected revenue, and as the use cases for its technology increase, this backlog figure will likely rise.But is that enough to make you a millionaire?First, we need to set a base investment amount. We'll use $10,000 because that's what I used in the Nvidia example above. To turn $10,000 into $1 million, a stock needs to rise 100 times in value. Currently, SoundHound is a $5.4 billion company, which means it would be valued at around $540 billion if it achieved that feat.So, what companies are valued at that threshold right now? That would put SoundHound in the same valuation range as Mastercard ($515 billion) and Oracle ($496 billion). Those are incredibly dominant companies that serve the whole globe, so this may be an unrealistic expectation.For further comparison, some of the largest software companies in the market right now are Salesforce ($310 billion) and Adobe ($199 billion). SoundHound's current revenue looks like a rounding error for these companies, even if its strong 2025 growth is incorporated.So, is SoundHound likely to make you a millionaire from a $10,000 investment? Probably not. But that doesn't mean it can't be a good investment. It has a strong product offering and is tackling an important niche in AI integration throughout society. It has strong growth ahead, but there are still a lot of risks involved in the stock, as other companies could easily offer an audio recognition platform that rivals SoundHound's.If you decide to invest in SoundHound, understand there's a high risk, but if it works out, there's also a high reward.Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and SoundHound AI wasnt one of them.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "There's been a lot of excitement in the stock market so far in 2025, mostly related to artificial intelligence (AI). The DeepSeek launch took investors by surprise a few weeks ago, and since then there's been a torrent of high-profile earnings reports like those of Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet.Despite all that, the S&P 500 index is up only 3% this year. It's just off its all-time high, and valuations are looking expensive right now. Yet, there are still bargains to be had and excellent stocks with long-term potential. Let's take a look at Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) and see if it should be on your buy list this year.Nu has demonstrated stellar growth since becoming a public company in 2021. It has grown its revenue by high double digit rates, and net income too has been increasing at a high rate, climbing from $303 million to $553.4 million year over year in the third quarter.The company operates as an all-digital bank in its home country of Brazil as well as its newer markets of Mexico and Colombia, and it's onboarding millions of new members annually. It added 5.2 million new customers in the 2024 third quarter alone and ended the quarter with 109.7 million.Most of its growth by numbers is still coming from Brazil, which has the largest population of any Latin American country. Nu had 98.8 million customers in Brazil as of the end of the third quarter, or 56% of the adult population, and 60% of active members use Nu as their primary bank account.Nu has its roots in targeting the mass consumer, who was largely locked out of the highly regulated banking system in Brazil, but it has since drawn attention from an affluent client base as well, who are attracted to Nu's all-online, easy-to-use financial app.It's growing quickly in Mexico, where it added 1.2 million customers in the third quarter for a total of 8.9 million. It's just getting started in Colombia, where it only has 2 million customers. It recently launched high-rate savings accounts in both of those markets, where its business is gaining traction, but it has a long growth runway.Besides for adding members, it's also generating growth from existing members through upsells and cross-sells. It has expanded its platform to include bank accounts, loan products, investing tools, and more, and average revenue per active user is increasing, rising from $10 to $11 year over year in the third quarter.Active members are using the platform often, indicated by an 83.6% activity rate, up from 82.8% the year before.Nu is growing by leaps and bounds, and it has a huge market opportunity in vertical and horizontal layers. However, it operates in a region with economic volatility, which creates risk. As a bank, it also deals with the challenges of economic cycles, and higher interest rates lead to higher defaults. Its nonperforming loans (NPL) have been on the rise, although third-quarter results were in line with expectations.It's also still fairly young and without an extensive track record. That's typical of almost any high-growth stock, and Nu wouldn't work for the highly risk-averse investor.Nu shares trade at a forward one-year P/E ratio of 16, which is a bargain for a growth stock. It's a higher valuation than that of a typical bank stock, but it's just a tad higher than some of the largest U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase, which is trading at a P/E of about 14. Nu is a hybrid, the quintessential fintech stock, using technology to improve the financial services sector. I see the bull case for Nu as much more compelling, and I would focus on the growth part of the company and call this a bargain.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "It's only February, but it's already been a wild year for semiconductor stocks.The launch of a new chatbot from Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek led to the biggest single-day loss ever in value for the chip sector. DeepSeek claimed to have spent just $5.5 million to train its model and used more efficient architecture to generate results that were similar to state-of-the-art \"frontier models\" from the likes of OpenAI, Alphabet, and others.Since then, investor nervousness has settled down as big tech companies have reaffirmed their commitment to spending on capital expenditures to drive progress in artificial intelligence. All of the big cloud infrastructure companies and Meta Platforms pledged to increase spending on capex, which should drive more revenue toward Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor sector.One of the stocks that is poised to win over the long term from the AI boom is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), the leading maker of lithography equipment used to make semiconductors. Let's take a look at three reasons why ASML looks like a good bet to outperform the market.The semiconductor equipment sector operates on a different cycle than chipmakers do, and demand has been underwhelming in recent quarters. Restrictions on exports to China have also weighed on the sector.As a result, ASML stock is now down 32% from its peak last July, but for patient investors, that sell-off sets up a buying opportunity.The company is on track to return to growth in 2025, forecasting revenue of 30 billion to 35 billion euros, or 15% growth from the 28.3 billion it reported in 2024.In the fourth quarter, the company also delivered solid sequential growth and reported strong bookings of 7.1 billion euros, indicating that the plunge in bookings in the third quarter was just a one-time blip. In addition to ASML's revenue forecast, the company also sees gross margin improving from 51.3% to between 52% and 53%, which should pay off on the bottom line.There's no shortage of commentary about the importance of competitive advantages, but ASML has one of the strongest economic moats in tech.The company, which has been developing lithography equipment for decades, is the only producer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) equipment in the world, and EUV machines are necessary for making the most advanced chips. ASML's machines work by using light to transfer complex circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.These machines are very expensive and complex, creating high barriers to entry, as no other company has the technology to match ASML. As billions from TSMC, Intel, and others pour into new foundries, ASML looks well positioned to benefit as semiconductor manufacturers are poised to increase spending over the coming years.While AI has taken over the narrative in the semiconductor industry, the majority of the industry is still devoted to conventional chips.However, AI demand will drive growth for ASML.On the fourth-quarter earnings report, CEO Christophe Fouquet said, \"Artificial intelligence has become the key driver for growth in our industry at this moment.\" He also noted that strong AI demand could lead to additional capacity coming online, which would lead the company to hit the high range of its guidance.Based on increasing demand for high-performance computing and high bandwidth memory, the company expects 2030 revenue of 44 billion to 60 billion euros, which represents 13% annual growth at the high end of that range.Additionally, the company sees gross margins moving significantly higher to between 56% and 66%, which would drive significant growth in profit.If AI stocks keep climbing, ASML is well positioned to be a winner.Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ASML wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The market spotlight has returned to Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) after its fourth quarter and 2024 earnings report. The e-commerce giant's figures highlighted a business that continues to expand at a brisk pace.The challenge for investors is whether that makes Shopify a buy. The stock has risen significantly since bottoming out in October 2022, and with a rising valuation, can investors still profit from it, or should they stay on the sidelines?For 2024, Shopify reported revenue of almost $8.9 billion, a 26% increase from 2023. Both of its segments contributed to this, with its platform-driven subscription services segment rising 28% and its merchant-services business increasing revenue by 25%.Moreover, in 2023, a $1.3 billion impairment charge wiped out nearly all of the company's profitability. This was not the case in 2024, when it reported just over $2 billion in net income. That was far above the $132 million profit in 2023.The one area that may have disappointed investors slightly was its revenue outlook. The company projects growth at a \"mid-twenties percentage rate,\" closely approximating the 2024 rate. Still, with revenue up 31% yearly in the fourth quarter amid the holiday rush, that forecast may have slightly dampened expectations.Indeed, Shopify has emerged as the company that merchants tend to turn to when they want to sell goods outside Amazon's massive ecosystem. Grand View Research forecasts a 19% compound annual growth rate for this industry through 2030 in what has already become a $29 trillion market.This growth should benefit Shopify since, according to e-commerce data collector Yaguara, the company holds a 10% market share globally and ranks fourth. In the U.S., its 29% market share makes it the country's most popular e-commerce software platform. The reason for these successes likely hinges on its ecosystem.First is Shopify's site itself, which offers merchants a flexible, no-code development experience and the power of rapid transactions to help maximize sales. Second, the company offers multiple ancillary services that support merchants. These include help with email marketing, raising capital, managing inventory (including goods sold offline), and other functions.Shopify's ecosystem growth may have gone too far when it tried to enter the logistics business in 2022. While it meant an increased competitive advantage, the expense of building the infrastructure and the resulting losses led management to sell this business in 2023, leading to the aforementioned impairment charge. With the sale of the logistics business, the company has returned to profitability while maintaining a notable competitive advantage.However, these successes may force investors to approach Shopify stock with caution. With that return to profitability, it is up more than 350% since the stock bottomed out in October 2022. This includes a 35% rise over the last year.Consequently, the trailing price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) recently was 77. And with Shopify selling at a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 18, its lofty valuation metrics will likely affect how investors approach the stock.Ultimately, investors can still feel comfortable buying the stock but may want to approach it cautiously.The stock is expensive, which adds to the risk. However, investors can mitigate that by adding shares slowly through dollar-cost averaging. That will allow them to benefit from the company's growth while freeing them to add shares faster should the stock fall in the near term.Over the longer term, Shopify is in a strong position, both in the U.S. and abroad, to capitalize on continued industry growth. As more merchants look to sell online, profits should swell as it serves more of the lucrative, growing e-commerce market.Before you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Shopify wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Their shoes are certainly different styles, but the businesses of Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) and Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX) aren't wildly different from each other. Each company sells shoes, both directly and through wholesale channels. But the similarities extend further.Crocs reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 on Feb. 13, so its finalized numbers aren't reflected on the chart below. But for 2024, Crocs had revenue of over $4.1 billion. For its part, Deckers has another quarter to go in its fiscal 2025, but for the full fiscal year, it expects net sales of $4.9 billion. Therefore, Deckers and Crocs are similar in scale.Deckers and Crocs are also similar in regards to profitability. For 2024, Crocs had an operating margin of about 25%, which is stellar. But Deckers isn't far behind: It expects a full-year operating margin of 22% for its fiscal 2025.As of this writing, shares of Deckers and Crocs are each down about 30% from their 52-week highs. That being the case, which of these two shoe stocks is the better buy today?In the investing world, growth isn't the only important thing to think about. But its importance can't really be overstated. Studies have shown that revenue growth is consistently the biggest factor for stocks that outperform the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). And Deckers has had better growth than Crocs.In fact, growth has all but disappeared for Crocs. Its 2024 revenue of $4.1 billion was only up 3.5% from 2023, due to the ongoing headwind of slumping sales for its other brand, Heydude. And for 2025, management only expects to grow revenue by 2.5%, at best.By contrast, Deckers has been growing. Through the first three quarters of its fiscal 2025, revenue is up 19% from the comparable period of its fiscal 2024. And for the full year, management expects to post 15% growth, boosted by ongoing robust growth rates for its two biggest brands: Ugg and Hoka.Another thing in Deckers' favor is its balance sheet. To be clear, the balance sheet for Crocs is very manageable, as I'll explain. But Crocs does still have over $1.3 billion in borrowings, whereas Deckers is debt-free. In short, Deckers has more financial flexibility.As much as it looks like Deckers stock could be a good investment, I feel Crocs stock is the better buy today, even after it jumped 24% following its quarterly report. And I don't think it's even close, as I'll explain.There are some faint signals suggesting Deckers' growth is about to slow. According to management's guidance, it expects fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of around $940 million. That would actually be down from the revenue of $960 million that it had in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. Moreover, its guidance implies a lower Q4 gross margin. This could mean that it plans to mark down prices to stimulate sales. But it still expects to struggle with growth.In this light, Crocs' outlook of 2% growth doesn't look so bad.In other words, the growth rates for Deckers and Crocs could be converging. And I've already noted that the operating margin is about the same, giving neither company a clear advantage. But from an investment perspective, Crocs stock is far cheaper, trading at less than 8 times earnings (keep in mind that the chart below isn't updated to reflect Crocs' Q4 results):Based on management's guidance, Crocs should earn $1 billion in operating income in 2025. By comparison, its market cap is only $6 billion. Based on the money it already has and the profits it expects, it could potentially pay off its debt entirely in 2025 if it chooses; I doubt it will, but the point is that the debt isn't an issue.Crocs will likely pay some of it down. After all, it repaid $323 million in 2024. But more likely it will return a ton of cash to shareholders with stock buybacks. Right now it's authorized to repurchase $1.3 billion worth, which could now buy a stunning 21% of its shares. If management decides to be aggressive at its currently cheap stock price, this could boost shareholder value in a hurry.As you can see, Crocs' business is stable and its profit margins remain stellar. And at its current valuation, it's simply too cheap to ignore. Compared to Deckers stock, I believe that Crocs stock is a far more compelling buy today.Before you buy stock in Crocs, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Crocs wasnt one of them.

        "content": "If you've ever been to a grocery store or convenience store, you know the brands that PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) sell. They are icons in the food and beverage niche of the consumer staples sector. But while they both have very attractive dividend yields right now, income investors will probably be better off focusing on the only company in this duo that is a Dividend King. Here's why.PepsiCo's dividend has been increased annually for 52 consecutive years. That puts it into the highly elite group of companies that are known as Dividend Kings. Achieving this status doesn't happen by accident -- it requires a strong business model that is executed well in both good times and bad times. If you are an income investor, PepsiCo should be of particular interest to you.That said, PepsiCo's dividend yield is \"only\" 3.6%. Kraft Heinz's yield is 5.4%. Despite the fact that PepsiCo's yield is near the highest levels in the company's history, yield-focused investors might still be more attracted to Kraft Heinz. But there's a little nuance that can't be ignored. Kraft Heinz's dividend has been stuck at $0.40 per share per quarter since it was cut at the start of 2019.This is where the difference between PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz really starts to take shape.Every company eventually faces a difficult period. If a company is around long enough, it will face many difficult periods. PepsiCo is suffering through a business slowdown today. Add in broader industry concerns about new weight loss drugs and what appears to be a shift toward increased health consciousness (among individuals and regulators), and investors are punishing the soda, snack, and packaged food giant.Still, 2024 organic sales were up 2%, and core earnings per share advanced 9%, so it isn't like PepsiCo's business has fallen off a cliff.That said, the company's outlook for 2025 was a bit subdued, with management guiding toward similar organic sales growth and earnings rates. Investors had come to expect more, given the strong performance PepsiCo exhibited coming out of the coronavirus pandemic. That enthusiasm was probably a bit overheated, since inflation was the primary driver of the price increases PepsiCo was able to push through its system. Slow and steady growth is really the norm for the company, and it's why long-term dividend investors will probably want to consider the stock today, given its historically high yield.But why not go with higher-yielding Kraft Heinz? The lack of dividend growth is one big reason, but it's the reason for the stagnant dividend that really matters.Kraft Heinz was created via the merger of food giants Kraft and Heinz, with the original goal of cutting costs to boost profits. That's a fine short-term plan, but not a good long-term plan. It quickly became apparent that this food giant needed to do something more. The new approach is to focus on the company's most important brands, which is a good idea.However, the brands on which it has been most focused have not been performing particularly well. Organic sales fell 4.5% among the \"accelerate\" brands, as they are called, in the third quarter of 2024, and then dropped another 5.2% in the fourth quarter. In other words, there's more work to be done before this company gets back on track.When you step back and look at PepsiCo and Kraft Heinz, you see two companies that are out of favor on Wall Street. Only PepsiCo looks like it is dealing with a short-term issue that it will likely weather in stride, as it has similar situations in the past. In fact, the business still appears to be growing -- just not as fast as it was a couple of years ago.Long-term dividend investors will probably find this Dividend King's story a lot more attractive than the slow-moving turnaround that Kraft Heinz is still working on. Will Kraft Heinz pull the turnaround off? Probably. But it seems likely that the dividend will be stuck in neutral for longer and that investors will have to suffer through difficult earnings reports for longer.Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasnt one of them.

        "content": "It's that time of year again. Many of us are working on our taxes or at least thinking that we need to get around to doing so eventually. Those who paid too much during the course of the year will get a refund check.For many, it can be tempting to spend that windfall on a splurge. However, the more responsible move would be to save it for a rainy day or invest it. For example, putting those funds into a high-yielding dividend stock could enable you to collect a lucrative stream of income for years.We asked some Fool.com contributors which great dividend stocks they'd recommend people buy with their tax refunds this spring. Here's why they view Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN.A)(NYSE: CWEN), and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) as standout picks.Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): The energy sector is generally viewed as being volatile. That's true of the upstream segment (energy production) and the downstream segment (chemicals and refining), but it's much less so for the midstream segment (pipelines and storage). The midstream, where Enterprise Products Partners operates, simply helps to connect the upstream to the downstream (and the rest of the world). And in that part of the industry, commodity prices aren't nearly as important as energy demand, which tends to remain fairly strong no matter what prices oil and natural gas are fetching.The consistency of Enterprise's business is highlighted by its streak of 26 consecutive annual distribution increases.The master limited partnership's distribution, meanwhile, is backed by an investment-grade-rated balance sheet and a payout ratio (against adjusted cash flow from operations) of just 55%. This is a rock-solid business that clearly places a high priority on returning cash to its unitholders.That said, there is a downside. The stock's high-yielding dividend is likely to provide most of the returns investors can expect. That's because most of the major investment opportunities in the midstream space have been exploited. Fee increases, modest capital investments, and the occasional bolt-on acquisition will help keep the distribution growing, but don't expect expansions to stray out of the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range. However, if you are focused on maximizing the income your portfolio generates, simply keeping up with inflation will likely be more than enough growth for you given the high starting yield on offer.Matt DiLallo (Clearway Energy): Clearway Energy owns one of the country's largest clean power generation portfolios. Its wind, solar, battery storage, and natural gas assets produce stable cash flows backed by long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements with utilities and large corporate customers. The company pays out 80% to 85% of its cash flow via a dividend that at current share prices yields 6.5%. Management aims to grow that high-yielding payout by about 6.8% this year and another 6.5% in 2026. Clearway has a clear line of sight toward the growth that should allow it to make those hikes. It has secured a large pipeline of investment opportunities that it expects to close as those renewable energy development projects enter commercial service and start producing cash flow. Clearway also has increasing growth visibility into 2027 and beyond. The company has already committed to a couple of new investments that should support future dividend hikes. It has also signed new agreements to sell its natural gas power at higher rates. These drivers could power dividend growth toward the low end of its 5% to 8% annual target range in 2027. Meanwhile, its strategic relationship with a renewable energy development company should supply it with a steady stream of new investment opportunities to power further dividend growth within that range beyond 2027. Clearway Energy pays a high-yielding dividend that should grow at a solid rate in the coming years. Because of that, investing your tax refund in this stock should give you a high-powered passive income stream.Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Infrastructure): A high yield can be alluring, but the best income stocks are the ones that pay and grow their dividends reliably. That's what makes Brookfield Infrastructure such a rock-solid pick. It has increased its dividend every year since its formation in 2008, and grew it at a compound annual rate of 9% over those years. Today, shares of the limited partnership (BIP) yield 5% while the company's corporate shares (BIPC) yield 4%.Brookfield Infrastructure is one of the world's largest owners and operators of infrastructure assets, but the kind of assets it invests in makes all the difference. Think utilities, gas pipelines, rail, toll roads, and data infrastructure -- all of which generate stable cash flows under long-term contracts. That explains how Brookfield Infrastructure has been able to keep paying those dividends reliably. As for payout hikes, multiple factors such as inflation indexation and capital recycling have added to its cash-flow growth. Capital recycling in particular is a key part of Brookfield Infrastructure's business strategy as the company divests itself of mature assets and reinvests in new assets with a better return potential.Brookfield Infrastructure entered 2025 on a strong note, having grown its funds from operations (FFO) by 8% and recycling assets worth $2 billion. It also announced a 6% dividend hike -- its 16th consecutive annual payout raise.Management expects this to be another strong year and has already lined up assets worth $5 billion to $6 billion to sell. With such plans, I fully expect Brookfield Infrastructure to be able to hit its goal of growing its FFO per unit by around 10% and its dividend by at least 5% every year. That makes this high-yield stock worth a bet, and a great way to make use of your tax refund.Before you buy stock in Enterprise Products Partners, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Enterprise Products Partners wasnt one of them.

        "content": "You couldn't have gone wrong buying shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) in the two companies' early days. A $10,000 investment in Costco when the giant wholesaler went public in 1985 would be worth almost $11.9 million today. If you had bought $10,000 of Amazon's shares after its IPO in 1997 and held them, you'd now have nearly $23.4 million.Both Amazon and Costco have delivered exceptional gains over the last 12 months, too. But which is the better stock to buy and hold forever?The primary reason behind the tremendous stock performances of Amazon and Costco is that both companies have great underlying businesses. However, they're very different from each other.Amazon is best known for its industry-leading online shopping platform. Its distribution and logistics operations that support this platform, though, are arguably the real secret to the company's e-commerce success. Thanks largely to these operations, Amazon has ranked as the lowest-priced U.S. retailer by Profitero for eight consecutive years.No company has been better at identifying new growth opportunities over the years than Amazon, in my opinion. It kicked off the cloud services market with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Last year, AWS generated $107.6 billion in revenue and operating income of $39.8 billion.Costco didn't invent the warehouse wholesale market. That honor belongs to Sol Price's Price Club. However, Costco perfected the business model. The company opened its first warehouse in 1983. In less than six years, its sales skyrocketed from $0 to $3 billion -- the first company to achieve such rapid growth. Costco also subsequently merged with Price Club in 1993.Today, Costco operates 897 warehouses in 14 countries. It also has a significant e-commerce business. The company has 77.4 million paid members and counting. And they're loyal customers: Costco's worldwide membership renewal rate is 90.4%.Amazon's greatest growth opportunity is in cloud services. Currently, around 90% of global IT spending remains on-premises, with roughly 10% of spending in the cloud. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes this dynamic will flip over the next 10 to 15 years.With the surging deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the cloud, Jassy's view seems realistic. As the biggest cloud services provider, AWS should be a huge winner from this shift.Jassy has a similar take on e-commerce. Physical stores still make up between 80% and 85% of the global retail market. Over the next 10 to 20 years, Jassy predicts that the equation will flip, with e-commerce dominating the retail market. Again, Amazon is poised to be a major beneficiary if Jassy is right.As it has in the past, Amazon is also expanding into new arenas. Advertising should become an even more important growth driver for the company in the coming years on its e-commerce platform and Prime Video. Amazon's planned launches of its Kuiper satellites to provide internet services is another long-term growth opportunity.Costco has a clear path to grow as well. Perhaps the most obvious opportunity is international expansion. Most of the company's warehouse locations are in the U.S.Adding products and services that boost profits at existing and new warehouses is another good way for Costco to grow. For example, the company's Kirkland Signature private-label brands are growing faster than the overall business. Costco also has great expectations for its retail media strategy. It began last year building an ad network using an extensive database of member's buying histories.E-commerce is another key opportunity for Costco. The company's digital business is growing quickly, with top sales categories including home furnishings, appliances, hardware, and sporting goods.I like both of these businesses. However, I think that Amazon is hands-down the better long-term pick.Importantly, Amazon has more growth opportunities than Costco does. Several of those opportunities, notably including cloud services, are also much larger than Costco's.Interestingly, though, higher growth expectations are baked into Costco's share price than with Amazon. Costco's shares trade at roughly 58.5 times forward earnings, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio based on five-year growth projections of 6.36. Amazon has a forward earnings multiple of 35.5 with a PEG ratio of 1.85.I don't expect Amazon to deliver the same level of growth that it has over the last 20 years. However, this stock should continue to be a winner for investors for a long time to come.Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Capital spending by technology giants remains top of mind for investors following earnings reports from Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (META), Meta Platforms (META) and others. Google stock has retreated about 10% since the company's fourth quarter earnings report on Feb. 4.The impact of generative artificial intelligence on the internet search advertising business of Google stock also remains the key issue for investors. Also, antitrust lawsuits filed by the Department of Justice have pressured Google stock. Both Google's internet search and advertising businesses are under DoJ scrutiny.Further, President Donald Trump has nominated Gail Slater for the top antitrust post at the Justice Department. Wall Street analysts haven't had much to say on Slater's appointment.As assistant attorney general for the antitrust division, Slater would oversee ongoing cases versus Google, Apple (AAPL) and other the companies.One view had been that a Trump DoJ may be more open to a settlement than the Biden administration or seek lighter penalties.In a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing, Slater said that \"resources\" will be a factor in pursuing the cases.Slater most recently was a policy adviser for Vice President JD Vance. Earlier, she worked at Fox (FOXA) and Roku (ROKU). Her government career includes 10 years at the Federal Trade Commission.Meanwhile, Google stock fell on its Q4 earnings report amid higher-than-expected 2025 capital spending.\"Advertising revenues were ahead of expectations, but Google Cloud was soft, operating income was in line and 2025 capex was well above Wall Street estimates,\" said Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee in a report.Like Alphabet, Amazon and Meta as well as Microsoft (MSFT) plan to continue high capital spending amid fierce competition in artificial intelligence. The emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek has roiled artificial intelligence stocks.Overall, Google stock has retreated about 2% in 2025. Shares trade below the 50-day moving average of Alphabet stock.Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi will take part in a Morgan Stanley conference on March 4.Amid U.S.-China trade friction, China's State Administration for Market Regulation, the nation's antitrust agency, announced it had opened an antitrust investigation into Google. The probe will reportedly focus on possible harm done against Chinese OEMs that use Google's Android operating system.Also, Google stock has dropped off the IBD Leaderboard. Also, Alphabet's technical ratings have weakened and it continues to under-perform some Magnificent Seven stocks.Generative AI startup OpenAI's ChatGPT has been slowly gaining search market share. ChatGPT delivers answers to search queries while Google's business model has been based on providing web links. Also, startup Perplexity is another new rival.Google is competing with OpenAI, Facebook-parent Meta and many others  in building new foundation models. In December, Google unveiled its new artificial intelligence model, Gemini 2.0.Google began deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid May, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. In late October, Google launched AI Overviews in 100 countriesThe AI Overviews system uses Google's in-house Gemini AI model. Advertisers utilizing Gemini AI tools see increased traffic and click-through rates, especially among younger demographics, Google says.In December, Google announced the Willow quantum computing chip. Google has been a leader in quantum research. But quantum technology faces challenges.Meanwhile, Waymo on Dec. 5 announced that the company plans to expand its autonomous vehicle rideshare service to Miami in 2026. The Waymo One robotaxi service currently operates in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with upcoming service already planned for Austin, Tex. and Atlanta. In Miami, Waymo will compete with Uber Technologies (UBER) and other rideshare services. In Austin and Atlanta, Waymo is partnering with Uber.Meanwhile, Waymo also disclosed that it has reached 150,000 trips per week, rapid growth from August levels at 100,00 per week. Waymo is widely viewed as the leader in autonomous vehicles. In October, Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round, including Google and previous investors. If Wall Street analysts start including Waymo in Alphabet's valuation, it would be a big development.Also, analysts say GOOGL stock is getting a boost from the Performance Max advertising platform. It automates buying across YouTube, internet search, display, Gmail, maps and other applications. Performance Max lets advertisers manage campaigns across all Google ad inventory.Aside from Google's core internet search advertising business, Wall Street analysts view growth at YouTube and cloud computing as key. Another question is the performance of Google's hardware business, where it's battling Apple in smartphones.Google aims to slow down the growth of TikTok with its own short video platform. How much money Google generates from YouTube Shorts is a key issue for 2024, analysts say. YouTube Shorts now generates roughly 70 billion daily views.In cloud computing, Google is still the third biggest service provider, behind Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft. Like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft' Azure business, Google's cloud unit has upped capital spending targeting the new opportunity in generative AI.Google's 2022 acquisition of cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion seems to be paying dividends. Mandiant is part of Google's cloud-based cybersecurity services.GOOGL stock popped 37% in 2024, though it pulled back from a high of 201.42 set on Dec. 17.Whether the internet giant is a buy depends on fundamental and technical factors as well as each investor's own goals, strategy and risk tolerance.Also, the Relative Strength Rating of Alphabet stock currently stands at 77 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The best stocks tend to have an RS rating of 80 or better.Google stock holds an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D-plus. That institutional ownership rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.Further, Alphabet stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a best possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.On MarketSurge, GOOGL stock has retreated back into a buy zone. But investors should be cautious. And, long-time holders could take profits.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing."

        "content": "Dividend stocks are one of the finest ways to build wealth over time, but there's more to it than just the yield. While companies that pay regular dividends to their shareholders are bankable, those that also grow their dividends regularly often generate huge returns for their shareholders over time.If you have some money to invest, here are three such incredible dividend stocks you could double up on now.Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP) has been a rock-solid dividend stock so far, and I would be surprised if it doesn't continue to be. With President Trump freezing funds for clean energy projects, some investors fear Brookfield Renewable's growth could decelerate. It is, after all, one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable energy companies with an extensive global footprint in hydro, solar, and wind power, and distributed energy.Investors in Brookfield, however, need not fear Trump's freeze. Demand for electricity won't fall, and the company has already locked in significant growth through its humongous and growing pipeline. To put some numbers to that, Brookfield Renewable has nearly 200 gigawatts, or 200,000 megawatts (MW) under development, and expects to commission around 10,000 MW per year.Last year set a record for the company, with its funds from operations (FFO) growing by 10%. Management recently announced a 5% dividend hike. It has increased its dividend every year since going public in 2011.With management targeting annual FFO per unit of 10% and annual dividend growth of 5% to 9%, Brookfield Renewable is a no-brainer stock to double up on right now. While the units of the partnership yield 6.9%, the company's corporate shares yield 5.6%.Oil and gas stocks can be volatile. Companies in the midstream energy space, however, are fairly immune to the volatility in commodity prices since they store, transport, and distribute oil and gas and other related products for a fee under long-term contracts.Nearly 90% of Energy Transfer's (NYSE: ET) earnings, for instance, come from fee-based contracts. That pretty much explains why it is also a strong dividend payer.Management made several growth moves in 2024. It acquired WTG Midstream for $2.3 billion in cash and 50.8 million shares of stock, formed a joint venture with Sunoco in the Permian Basin, and announced six major projects. WTG added nearly 6,000 miles of gas gathering pipelines to the company's portfolio in the Midland Basin.Energy Transfer delivered record numbers for 2024 and generated $8.4 billion in distributable cash flow (DCF), up almost 11% from 2023. That DCF could conveniently cover the company's dividends and leave ample leeway for it to invest in growth.In 2025, it expects to spend $5 billion on capital projects, with the bulk of it to be directed toward the Permian Basin. That's also $2 billion higher than its 2024 spending, illustrating the company's focus on growth.Energy Transfer expects to raise its dividend by 3% to 5% every year. With the stock also yielding a massive 6.6%, investors who double up on this energy dividend stock now could reap rich returns in the coming years.If you have never invested in a boring company for its dividends, you must read this. You might be surprised to know the kinds of returns some of these stocks can earn for you. Waste Management (NYSE: WM) is one such stock you would even want to double up on now, given the company's latest numbers, outlook, and dividend growth goals.Last year was big for Waste Management. It acquired Stericycle, North America's largest medical-waste management company, for $7.2 billion. Since management used debt to fund the acquisition, it has suspended share repurchases because it wants to use cash to repay debt first and fortify its balance sheet again. However, the company remains committed to growing its dividend.Stericycle has added a strong, new market to Waste Management's portfolio and is expected to be a big boost for the company. For instance, the latter expects to grow its revenue by nearly 16% at the midpoint of its guidance range in 2025, twice its 2024 figure. The bulk of its top-line growth this year is expected to come from Stericycle.Waste Management also expects its free cash flow (FCF) to grow by almost 18% in 2025. That's the most crucial number for income investors because a company pays dividends out of its FCF. In other words, growing FCF for a dividend growth stock almost assures higher dividends. And Waste Management has an incredible dividend track record: It has increased its payout for 22 consecutive years, including a 10% hike announced in December 2024.You might be surprised to see how massively rich that dividend growth, with the payouts reinvested, has made investors over the years.In just the past decade, shares have generated more than 400% in total returns. While past performance doesn't guarantee future returns, Waste Management stock has everything it needs to grow its dividends further and richly reward shareholders.Before you buy stock in Brookfield Renewable, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Brookfield Renewable wasnt one of them.

        "content": "In what's become something of a habit, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) surprised on the upside in its second quarter of fiscal 2025. Not only that, the huge, sprawling, and very well-established company managed to grow key fundamentals, a feat that isn't easy to accomplish at this size and scope.What I find particularly admirable about this quarter isn't necessarily what the company did to power that growth. It's about what it didn't do. Allow me to explain.Procter & Gamble managed to boost its net sales by 2% year over year during the quarter to just under $21.9 billion. On a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, what the company calls its \"core\" earnings landed at $1.88 per share, again a 2% increase.In pure percentage terms, 2% isn't a \"wow\" figure. But for the immense Procter & Gamble, this means a net sales improvement of roughly $500 million across that one-year span. Even some of the most famous and widely admired businesses don't earn half a billion dollars over a year, let alone add it to their already considerable top line in such a brief stretch of time.The really admirable aspect to this is that Procter & Gamble engineered this growth without raising prices, its time-honored tactic to help juice top-line increases. This was the first time in six years the company kept prices level. So that $500 million rise was entirely due to higher volume.Another feat is that, of the five main product categories, none saw a decline in volume. Beauty broke even, while fabric/home care, grooming, healthcare and, especially, baby, feminine and family care all posted gains. Happily, the latter category is the second largest of the quintet in terms of total net sales. Witness:Product CategoryNet Sales (bn)YOY GrowthFabric and home care$7,5752%Baby, feminine and family care$5,2984%Beauty$3,848n/aHealthcare$3,2492%Grooming$1,7521%Source: Procter & Gamble. YOY = year over year.Those sorts of numbers are in line with the better quarters Procter & Gamble has posted in the recent past. They also topped professional expectations -- on average, analysts tracking the stock were modeling less than $21.7 billion in net sales for the period.Better-than-average net sales growth is something of a bonus for many Procter & Gamble investors. That's because it's widely, and justifiably, considered one of the sturdier income stocks on the scene.It's one of the S&P 500 index's precious few Dividend Kings, that exclusive club of companies that have effected dividend raises at least once every year for a minimum of 50 years running. On top of that, Procter & Gamble has one of the longest streaks. At 68 straight years, that's almost the all-time record, and it beats that of luminaries such as Coca-Cola, Target, and Walmart.It's a relatively generous payout, too, with a 2.5% yield that is more than double the percentage rate of the S&P 500's 1.2% average.Procter & Gamble has indicated it will increase its spend on shareholder remuneration. So investors can fully expect yet another dividend raise in the looming future (management tends to announce such hikes in April) in addition to hefty share repurchases.It might not be the most exciting company around. Nevertheless, it's managing to do better than many thought. It's product lineup is wide and popular, and clearly management knows how to get more of those goods into consumer hands. I like how Procter & Gamble's fundamentals are developing, and as ever, I'm a fan of that dividend. This is one of the most solid stocks an investor can own.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "source": "USA TODAY",
        "content": "One of the Trump White Houses key policy reforms may be something that touches the lives of millions of Americans  but few know about.The administration will likely attempt to unshackle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage guarantors, from their current position as wards of the state, analysts believe and Scott Turner, the new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, confirmed to the Wall Street Journal earlier in February.Housing finance observers see it as an opportunity to fundamentally remake a system that hasnt been able to purge systemic racism embedded in its processes, and to close the gap on serving historically marginalized communities.Reform of the two Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), as they are often called in housing circles, is a timely and relevant conversation, said Michael Neal, a senior fellow in the Housing Finance Policy Center of the Washington, DC-based Urban Institute. \"Any discussion of the GSEs needs to be part of a holistic look at the housing finance system, making sure that historically marginalized communities have access, in whatever the final outcome is,\" Neal said.Fannie and Freddie play an important role in the housing market by buying mortgages from banks and other lenders. That allows lenders to offload risk, then extend credit to more borrowers, keeping the housing market liquid and more affordable than it would otherwise be.Before the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie were private companies. As the subprime bubble inflated in the early 2000s, they lowered their underwriting standards to remain competitive. When the bubble burst in 2008, the two enterprises were rushed into government-controlled conservatorship.That arrangement was always intended to be temporary, but for nearly two decades, the details of unwinding such massive institutions have bedeviled three presidential administrations. Meanwhile, under conservatorship and with a new regulator, the two enterprises have prioritized safety and stability.The serious delinquency rate among mortgages guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie was 0.53% at the end of 2024, their regulator reported, substantially lower than the 1.55% for all loans across the mortgage industry.That sense of stability and safety has led many housing observers to refer to Fannie and Freddie as being utility-like: staid, stable  but not innovative. Vanessa Perry, interim dean of the George Washington University School of Business, agrees with that assessment.The idea that these entities could be reprivatized is one that has some promise, Perry told USA TODAY. Because if they did not have that extra regulatory layer, they could actually start to experiment with some innovations.One of the most significant ways Fannie and Freddie could innovate to serve more people is to look at non-traditional ways of assessing borrower creditworthiness, Perry noted. One example: the two have started to allow lenders to consider a borrowers history of rental payments. But they could be even more creative if they're no longer saddled with that layer of oversight, she said.Releasing Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship toward a structure oriented more toward the private sector doesn't have to mean they'll lose their focus on mission, Perry said. Providing liquidity and serving low and moderate income borrowers and households and communities has always been part of their missions.In fact, in the years before the crisis, the proportion of Fannie and Freddies mortgages made to Black borrowers was at least double what its been under conservatorship, she said.Keeping the focus on historically underserved communities in the mortgage market is an apt way to observe Black History Month, Neal thinks.Allowing everyone the same opportunity to build wealth, especially through housing, is an important goal, he said. Certainly that brings up the need for more housing, but also highlights the importance of ensuring that everyone can access a sustainable mortgage.https://www.gannett-cdn.com/experiments/usatoday/tools/static-graphic-embeds/index.html?infogram=%3Cdiv%20class%3D%22infogram-embed%22%20data-id%3D%22_%2FVDz3EQw16pCFb2Fgondv%22%20data-type%3D%22interactive%22%20data-title%3D%22Share%20of%20home%20US%20home%20value%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3ENeal and fellow Urban Institute researchers have previously published research showing that deep discrepancies in mortgage lending lead to stubborn disparities in wealth. In 2023, mortgage applications from Black borrowers were denied twice as often as those from white borrowers. As of 2024, the Black homeownership rate was 45.3%, a whopping 30 percentage points below that of white households, at 74.4%.More: Black borrowers' mortgage applications denied twice as often as whites', report showsHomeownership is still our primary route to household wealth creation and accumulation and intergenerational transfers, Perry said. We are at a place in the United States where the growth opportunity for the housing market lies in first-time home buyers. Do we now have the opportunity to expand the market so that more people can become homeowners? That would not just be good for those segments, but great for our entire economy.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Could freeing Fannie and Freddie lead to a fairer housing system?"

        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ: TTD) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TSLA) generated monster shareholder returns of 555% and 163%, respectively, over the past five years. And certain Wall Street analysts think that momentum will carry into the future, as detailed below:Analysts led by Tasha Keeney at Ark Invest have set Tesla with a 2029 target of $2,600 per share. That forecast implies 630% upside from its current share price of $356.Matthew Cost at Morgan Stanley has set The Trade Desk with a 12-month bull-case target of $200 per share. That forecast implies 150% upside from its current share price of $80.Here's what investors should know about these monster stocks.Despite losing market share in the U.S. and China, Tesla retained its leadership position in electric car sales in 2024. But the company struggled with weak demand throughout the year, driven by increased competition and high interest rates. And price cuts meant to lure potential buyers cut deeply into profitability, which led to a series of disappointing financial results.In the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 2% to $26 billion, reflecting strong growth in the energy business offset by a decline in automotive sales. Meanwhile, operating margin contracted 2 percentage points, and non-GAAP net income increased just 3% to $0.73 per diluted share. Also noteworthy, Tesla reported an annual decline in vehicle deliveries for the first time in company history.However, CEO Elon Musk shared good news on the fourth-quarter earnings call: This June, Tesla will begin offering autonomous ride-sharing (robotaxi) services in Austin, and other U.S. cities will follow shortly thereafter. \"I expect us to be operating unsupervised activity with our internal fleet in several cities by the end of the year,\" Musk told analysts.Importantly, Ark Invest's target of $2,600 per share assumes total revenue will reach $1.2 trillion by 2029, and that robotaxis will account for about $750 billion of that figure. But that implies annual revenue growth of 65% in the next four years. Even if Tesla has a booming robotaxi business by then, that estimate seems too optimistic when the entire ride-sharing market was worth less than $50 billion last year.That said, demand for ride-sharing services could increase rapidly in the future as robotaxis reduce costs. For instance, Ark Invest estimates the addressable market will be $10 trillion by 2030. Assuming that estimate is correct, Tesla's robotaxi revenue could theoretically hit $750 billion with less than 10% market penetration. But I am still very skeptical about the timeline.Wall Street expects Tesla's adjusted earnings to grow at 22% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 147 times adjusted earnings look absurdly expensive. There is only one way that multiple looks sensible in hindsight: Earnings growth must accelerate substantially as Tesla monetizes robotaxis and robotics.Investors that lack confidence in that narrative should avoid the stock. However, investors that believe Tesla can disrupt the mobility industry should own a position. Now is as good a time as any to buy a few shares, though I doubt the stock will return 630% by 2029.The Trade Desk specializes in digital advertising. Its demand-side platform (DSP) helps ad agencies and brands automate, optimize, and measure data-driven ad campaigns across digital channels. It was among the first ad tech companies to add artificial intelligence to its software, and CEO Jeff Green says it still has \"the most advanced data-driven decision-making platform\" in the industry.The Trade Desk competes giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms, but its independence is an important advantage. Specifically, The Trade Desk does not own ad inventory, which eliminates the conflict of interest inherent to many competitors. For example, Alphabet has a clear incentive to steer media-buyers toward advertising inventory on Google Search and YouTube.Additionally, because The Trade Desk does not compete with publishers (companies that sell ad inventory), those publishers willingly share data. That means The Trade Desk can offer clients measurement capabilities not available on competing platforms. For instance, the company has partner with many the largest retailers, such that it has \"the industry's richest retail data environment,\" according to Jeff Green.The Trade Desk delivered disappointing financial results in the fourth quarter, missing its revenue guidance for the first time in 33 quarters. Specifically, revenue increased 22% to $741 million, well short of the forecasted $756 million, and non-GAAP earnings increased 44% to $0.59 per diluted share.Jeff Green attributed the revenue shortfall to a \"series of small execution missteps,\" and he detailed changes the company has made to correct the problems. That includes reorganizing to improve efficiency, building relationships directly with brands rather than working exclusively with ad agencies, and shifting product development to small weekly updates rather than larger but less frequent releases.Importantly, Morgan Stanley's bull-case target of $200 per share assumes revenue grows at 29% annually through 2027. That is plausible given that ad tech spending is projected to increase at 22% annually through 2030. But investors would also need to afford The Trade Desk a much higher price-to-sales multiple, which makes the $200-per-share target a long shot at best.However, The Trade Desk is still an attractive investment. The stock currently trades at 44 times forward earnings, a substantial discount to the two-year average of 57 times forward earnings. Investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should feel comfortable buying a position today.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have delivered explosive returns to investors since bottoming out in 2022, and the stock continues to hit new highs. The stock surged recently after the company reported strong revenue and earnings performance in the fourth quarter.Despite the stock's monster run, it still offers upside. The shares are trading at a reasonable earnings multiple of 30, consistent with the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) average. Moreover, the latest earnings report revealed a few catalysts that are boosting investor confidence in the social media leader's growth prospects.Here are three reasons the stock is a buy.Big tech companies have accelerated their capital spending over the last year to support the build-out of technology infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). But not all are seeing improving earnings growth and return on capital employed.Consider that Microsoft and Meta Platforms have roughly doubled their capital expenditures over the last three years, but Microsoft reported earnings growth of just 10% year over year in the most recent quarter, while its return on capital dipped a few percentage points to 30%.Meanwhile, Meta Platforms increased its capital expenditures by 37% to $37 billion in 2024, but its earnings per share grew an impressive 60% year over year. This stellar performance increased its return on capital to a company-record 33.6% last year.Meta's improving returns on capital and robust earnings growth is boosting investor confidence in its AI strategy.Meta's primary means of generating revenue from its social media platforms is advertising. The company's revenue grew 22% in 2024, reaching $164 billion, and there are two ways AI could benefit its future growth.Meta AI is a personalized assistant that could reach more than 1 billion users this year. As the company continues to train its AI models, this assistant will get better at learning about a user's interests and increase their engagement with Meta's family of apps. This could have a significant impact on advertising.Last year, Meta and AI chip leader Nvidia teamed up to launch Andromeda, a machine learning system that is improving advertising performance. Andromeda filters through tens of millions of ads to find a small number that will be most relevant to someone browsing one of Meta's apps.Meta has a powerful growth engine working here. Meta AI is helping increase user engagement on one end, and on the other, Andromeda is making it easier for advertisers to connect with more than 3.3 billion daily active users.Another factor that is raising investor sentiment around Meta stock is the potential for a growing number of use cases with AI over the long term. One of those opportunities is Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses that have reportedly sold more than 1 million, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is optimistic about future sales.\"This will be a defining year that determines if we're on a path toward many hundreds of millions, and eventually billions, of AI glasses, and glasses being the next computing platform like we've been talking about for some time, or if this is just going to be a longer grind,\" he said during the Q4 earnings call.It's possible Meta's Ray-Ban glasses might have hit their ceiling, considering how previous attempts have failed (e.g., Alphabet's Google Glass). But management is clearly not giving up on the potential for this to become a significant revenue contributor over time, and considering the popularity of Ray-Ban, these new glasses could find a growing audience.Importantly, this product won't hurt Meta's business if it fails, but if they take off, it would further validate Meta Platforms' AI strategy and fuel the stock higher.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "At first glance, it may not look like a great time to find \"cheap stocks.\" The S&P 500 is close to all-time highs, and some of the more prominent consumer stocks are the reason for its performance.Nonetheless, the rally has left some of these stocks behind amid temporary challenges. That means investors are not too late to benefit from the current rally. Even with a budget of $500, these three value stocks can offer budget-minded investors long-term potential for growth at a reasonable price.Energy drink company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) has thrived in recent years. Its zero-sugar approach and scientific research on energy drinks won it a following among health enthusiasts, and a distribution deal with PepsiCo made its beverages easily available to the mass market.Unfortunately, a sales slowdown prompted a major distributor, likely PepsiCo, to dramatically scale back orders in mid-2024. That reversed its red-hot revenue growth, at least temporarily. Since that time, the stock has fallen back by nearly 80%, and the slowdown in U.S. sales does not appear to have ended.The lower stock price has taken its P/E ratio down to about 30, its lowest level since 2020. Moreover, even if U.S. sales do not pick up, it has a tremendous international opportunity. Outside of the U.S., sales increased by 37% in the third quarter of 2024. Also, international sales are just 7% of Celsius' revenue, meaning the company has barely tapped the massive markets in Europe and Asia.Admittedly, as the distributor rightsizes its purchases from Celsius, the massive sales gains in recent years may or may not resume in the U.S. Nonetheless, with the fast-growing international markets becoming a larger share of overall sales, Celsius stock could prosper again as its global market expands.Tech and consumer conglomerate Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) may not be familiar to U.S. investors. However, the company operates market-leading e-commerce and fintech businesses in southeast Asia, and its gaming business claims one of the world's most popular mobile games, Free Fire.Moreover, Sea Limited was a high-flying stock during the pandemic, and its fintech arm, SeaMoney, has steadily grown even in more difficult times. Still, missteps with e-commerce outside southeast Asia and the ban of Free Fire in India led to a massive sell-off in 2022 and 2023.Fortunately, its e-commerce company, Shopee, scaled back outside southeast Asia. Now, it has followed in Amazon's footsteps by investing heavily in logistics in its home markets, expanding its competitive advantage.Also, its gaming segment, Garena, will likely benefit from Free Fire returning to India soon. Additionally, its Need for Speed mobile game has gained increased traction in Asia, which will help reverse declines in this segment.Amid those improvements, profit expectations have taken the company's forward P/E to around 34, just below the much larger Amazon at 37 times forward earnings. With all three businesses on track for increased prosperity, Sea Limited stock may have just begun to grow.Retail giant Target (NYSE: TGT) has struggled in recent years. The retailer has faced a sluggish economy and rising inflation. Internally, it had challenges rightsizing its inventory. Also, with the failure to succeed with its only international expansion in Canada a few years ago, Target's presence in all 50 states leaves it with few obvious avenues for expansion.Still, despite its slow growth, the company and its stock have some bright spots. Companies including Ulta Beauty, Starbucks, and Apple operate shops within Target, which serve as a draw to bring people into its stores.Also, the company has stepped up its omni-channel shopping experience and can often deliver goods on the same day. Thanks to its Target Circle 360 loyalty program, deliveries are free for orders more than $35.Additionally, shareholders benefit from a payout of $4.48 per share annually, a dividend yield of 3.4%. That's far above the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. Given its 53-year history of raising its payout, it is likely the Dividend King will remain an excellent choice for income investors.Also, the stock's woes have taken its P/E ratio to about 14, a level far below Amazon, Walmart, or Costco Wholesale. Assuming Target can overcome what are probably temporary challenges, the potential for multiple expansion alone could drive significant returns.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Fairfax Financial has reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of $1.15bn for the fourth quarter of 2024 (Q4 2024), a 14.7% decrease from $1.32bn in Q4 2023.Net earnings per diluted share dropped to $50.42 in Q4 2024 from $52.87 the prior year.The company's operating income for property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance increased to $2bn in the three-month-period ended 31 December 2024, up from $1.47bn in the same period the previous year.Underwriting profit rose to $658.3m in Q4 2024 compared with $579.3m in the year-ago quarter, while net premiums written increased from $5.2bn to $5.9bn.For the full-year, the company logged net earnings of $4.2bn for 2024, down by 19% from $5bn in 2023.Full-year net earnings per diluted share decreased to $160.56 in 2024 from $173.24 in 2023.The operating income for P&C insurance and reinsurance for the full year was $6.5bn in 2024, an increase from $5.7bn in 2023.The company's chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa, attributed this growth to strong underwriting performance and interest and dividends, and continued favourable results from share of profit of associates.Underwriting profit for the full year stood at $1.8bn in 2024, up from $1.5bn in 2023, reflecting growth in business volumes and higher net favourable prior year reserve development.Net premiums written by the P&C insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 11.6% to a record $25.3bn, with gross premiums written up by 12.6%.This growth was primarily due to the consolidation of Gulf Insurance on 26 December 2023, which contributed $1.6bn to net premiums written and $2.7bn to gross premiums written in 2024, and continued growth across most operating companies.On 23 January 2025, Fairfax Financial sold 80 million shares, approximately a 2.2% equity interest, in Eurobank for gross proceeds of $190.8m (183.5m), received by the holding company.This sale reduced the company's equity interest to 32.3% and will result in the recognition of a realised gain of approximately $40m in the consolidated statement of earnings in Q1 2025.Additionally, on 13 December 2024, the company increased its ownership interest in Brit from 86.2% to 100% by purchasing the remaining shares from Brit's minority shareholder.Of the total gross premiums written, the Global Insurers and Reinsurers segment accounted for $17.15bn, with Brit contributing $3.76bn.Watsa said: During the year we purchased 1,346,953 subordinate voting shares for cancellation for cash consideration of approximately $1.6bn, or $1,179 per share.We remain focused on being soundly financed and ended 2024 in a strong financial position with $2.5bn in cash, marketable securities and investments in the holding company, and an additional $2bn, at fair value, of investments in associates and consolidated non-insurance companies owned by the holding company.Earlier this year, Lloyds syndicate Ki transitioned into a stand-alone entity within Fairfax Group after completing its separation from its parent company.\"Fairfax Financial net earnings dip to $1.15bn in Q4 2024 \" was originally created and published by Life Insurance International, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "content": "If you've been around long enough, you will encounter some bumps in the road. This is true for The Hershey Company (NYSE: HSY), whose history dates back to the 1890s. The company is among the most iconic global food and beverage brands today.The stock has fallen over 40% from its peak, which is shocking considering the broader stock market is at all-time highs. The last time Hershey's stock took a tumble this bad was during a global recession in 2008. However, this time it's about the company. Hershey is dealing with crushing margin pressure and fears that GLP-1 agonists, a popular weight loss drug, are turning consumers away from sweets.I'll admit: It's not pretty at first glance. But if you dig deeper, the stock could be among the best deals on Wall Street. Here is why investors should consider buying Hershey today and holding it forever.As I said, Hershey is experiencing a crisis right now. The company recently completed its 2024 fiscal reporting and released woeful 2025 guidance, calling for earnings per share of $6 to $6.18, down significantly from $9.37 in 2024. The confectionery giant blamed the anticipated decline on higher commodity costs, rebased incentive compensation, and a higher tax rate.It's not that Hershey isn't selling sweets; management guided for 2% revenue growth for 2025. This is all about the underlying costs associated (primarily) with cocoa prices. You can see that cocoa prices have exploded like a meme stock in a market bubble:The reason? Roughly 70% of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa. Adverse weather has hurt crop yields and disrupted the global supply. Hershey has combated rising costs with price increases, but you can only do that so much. This year, Hershey will feel more of the brunt of high cocoa prices. According to industry analysts, cocoa prices should begin to ease this year, barring further disruptions to production.What about weight loss drugs? Right now, fears seem more like bark than bite. Hershey's management noted specifically on its fourth-quarter earnings call that it's not seeing any material impact on sales due to GLP-1 agonists. It will take time for things to normalize again, but this is all external to Hershey. Is this unfortunate? Of course. However, it doesn't mean Hershey is a lousy business.You never want to let share prices alone dictate your view on a business. Stocks go up and down. However, if you buy and hold quality companies, they should drift higher over the long term.Hershey is a world-class company for reasons far beyond its well-known snacks and candy brands, such as Reese's, Twizzlers, Almond Joy, Skinny Pop, and more. The business has thrived through good and bad economies, becoming a cultural staple consumers (primarily Americans) buy year-round.The business is also highly profitable and efficient. Hershey's return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged over 21% over the past five years. Additionally, $0.15 to $0.20 of every revenue dollar generates free cash flow each year. Thus, you don't need tremendous growth to create shareholder value when you're profitable and efficient with your capital.Hershey's stock has slumped in recent years; it has trounced the S&P 500 index throughout history. Shares have returned over 4,200% since 1989, including the stock's 42% drop! As I said above, Hershey's current woes likely don't reflect the business, so investors can be more optimistic about the stock reverting to its glorious winning ways of past years.Hershey faithfully pays a dividend, which management has increased annually for 15 consecutive years. The company can technically afford its dividend with guided 2025 earnings, though it will be much tighter than in recent memory, so investors should keep that in mind.That said, investors can value a dividend stock by its yield. You can see that Hershey's dividend seldom yields this much:There are two sides to the coin. Hershey's stock is the cheapest in years from the perspective of its dividend. At the same time, there's more risk in Hershey's stock than in recent memory. The key takeaway is that investors must decide whether they think Hershey's problems will disappear over time.If so, Hershey could generate tremendous investment returns as it eventually reverts to its historical norms. The evidence suggests that Hershey will rebound as cocoa prices ease. Of course, that may take time. Until then, Hershey remains a wounded blue chip stock worth rolling the dice on in a diversified portfolio.Before you buy stock in Hershey, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Hershey wasnt one of them.

        "content": "American Express (NYSE: AXP) is one of those well-established companies that can be easy to overlook, if only because it's been around for so long (the company turns 175 next month). While flashier financial stocks may be tempting to buy, there are plenty of reasons why this long-standing company has been a favorite of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.The company accounts for roughly 15% of Berkshire's holdings, making it the second-largest holding behind Apple. Here are a few reasons to follow Buffett's lead and buy American Express while it's trading below $320.American Express reported 2024 results at the end of January, with total sales rising 9% to $65.9 billion and diluted earnings per share surging 25% to $14.01. Those strong results were fueled by increased spending by customers and strong customer acquisition (more on that later).The strong top- and bottom-line results prompted management to issue impressive 2025 guidance, with revenue growth of 9% and an estimated earnings-per-share increase of 14% to $15.25, both at the midpoint.It's worth mentioning that American Express CFO Christophe Le Caillec said recently that first-quarter growth will be slower than in the previous quarter. Le Caillec said at a financial conference that fewer days in the quarter and a stronger dollar would cause lower revenue, but he also reiterated that the American Express' full-year guidance is still intact.One standout from the company's full-year results was that it added a record number of new card acquisitions -- some 13 million. Even more impressive is that 70% of those new cards are \"fee-paying products,\" meaning customers pay an annual fee to use them.Adding to the good news for American Express is that younger, more affluent customers are ramping up spending. Gen Z and millennial spending rose 16% in the fourth quarter.\"Across the industry, the number of millennials and Gen Z consumers with premium products are growing at an even faster rate, and we're adding highly creditworthy customers in these cohorts faster than the industry, with substantial room to continue this growth,\" Le Caillec said on the latest earnings call.Attracting younger customers is important to the company's long-term strategy because it helps lock in customers for years. Management noted on the call that as Gen Z customers get older, they'll be more likely to tap American Express for things like small business loans and other forms of credit.Management also added that the company expanded its coverage in international markets, reaching 80% coverage of 12 countries, up 8 percentage points from three years ago. The growth came from adding millions of new international merchants in 2024.American Express' stock has made impressive gains of 48% over the past year, compared to the S&P 500's 23% rise. But even with those gains, its shares look relatively cheap. The stock has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 20, compared to the S&P 500's multiple around 24.With American Express rapidly increasing new card members, expanding sales and earnings, and management anticipating another strong year, now could be a good time to start a position or add to an existing one. And with its shares being relatively inexpensive right now, there's little reason to wait on the sidelines.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then youll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "Is red-hot Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: LUNR) stock finally starting to cool off?Shares of the space stock roughly doubled in price over the six weeks between mid-December and late January, eventually hitting an intraday high of $24.95 on Friday, Jan. 24. As January has turned into February, however, the stock has given back much of its gains. Friday last week, for example, the stock closed at just $18.40, down 26% from its recent high.Why? In part, I suspect we're seeing the what happens when reality catches up to irrational exuberance over a momentum stock. But in part, I fear Intuitive Machines is itself to blame for its stock price rollback. On Feb. 4, Intuitive Machines announced that it is redeeming its warrants.Let's start with a definition of stock warrants, and what it means to \"redeem\" stock warrants.When a private company decides to go public by merging with a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company in a SPAC IPO, as Intuitive Machines did back in 2023, it often provides investors an incentive to entice them to buy shares. Specifically, it will sweeten the deal by giving buyers the right to purchase additional shares of the company post-IPO at a specified strike price.This right is called a \"warrant,\" and in Intuitive Machines' case, the warrants it sold at its IPO entitled investors to buy shares of Intuitive Machines stock for $11.50 (under the condition that the company's stock sold for at least $18 for 20 days straight before the offer to redeem was made, a condition that has now been fulfilled).These warrants have become increasingly valuable to investors as Intuitive Machines stock surged to prices far in excess of the $11.50 strike price. However, the warrants also hold the potential to dilute Intuitive's share count once they're exercised, and force the company to issue new shares in exchange for the warrants.To remove uncertainty about the size of its future share count, Intuitive Machines announced last week that it is exercising its own right to buy back the warrants -- to \"redeem\" them, or hold a \"warrant redemption.\"Although the warrants are very valuable if exercised right now, Intuitive Machines has valued them, unexercised, at just $0.01 each, which is the price it's offering to pay. So buying back the warrants would be all but free for the company.Investors aren't likely to think that's a great deal, however. Logically, they're going to exercise all their warrants (i.e., trading in their warrants, plus $11.50 each, in exchange for new Intuitive Machines shares) before the deadline for redemption.Intuitive Machines says \"any Warrants that remain unexercised at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date [which is March 6, 2025] will be void and no longer exercisable.\" So one way or another (or another), by the time March 6 rolls around, all Intuitive Machines stock warrants will either have (1) been exercised, generating $11.50 each for Intuitive Machines, or (2) been redeemed, costing Intuitive $0.01 each, or (3) expired worthless.Option 1 is of course the most likely outcome. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Intuitive Machines originally had 22.6 million warrants outstanding. Multiplied by $11.50 each, that means the company can probably expect to soon collect approximately $260.3 million in payments (minus the value of payments for any warrants that were exercised before the redemption announcement), and to issue 22.6 million new shares for them.The ultimate effect of these changes: Intuitive Machines' cash reserves will rise to approximately $350 million, and its share count will rise to 113.9 million.That's a significant amount of share dilution -- roughly 25% on a share count that currently stands at 91.3 million -- which isn't great news for investors and probably explains the stock's recent weakness. On the plus side, the $350 million in extra cash will come in handy as Intuitive Machines continues to build bigger and better lunar landers for NASA, and begins work on its gigantic $4.8 billion NASA contract to build a space communications relay from the Earth to the moon.Dilution notwithstanding, I have to think this development is a net positive for Intuitive Machines stock, and that investors who've been selling the stock lately are making the wrong call.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has essentially owned the data center computing market, which is a huge deal, considering the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Nvidia is one of the primary benefactors of this investment, although some of its competitors, like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), are also benefiting.However, the lead that Nvidia has surmounted looks unassailable, but all it takes is one innovation, and AMD could be neck and neck with Nvidia.So, which of these two is the better AI stock for 2025?Nvidia's GPUs and software have become the industry standard in data centers. While AMD's GPUs look like they can compete on paper, Nvidia's software, CUDA, sets it apart. This software allows GPUs to process multiple calculations simultaneously and handle the sheer computing tasks that AI computing requires.Because the industry has essentially adopted CUDA software versus AMD's ROCm, it's unlikely that AMD will ever be able to surmount Nvidia's lead in the data center race. The switching costs of moving from one supplier to another when the infrastructure is already set up for one is a massive consideration and is the primary hurdle for anyone switching.Nvidia's lead over AMD can be seen in both of their financials. Each has a data center division, and Nvidia's lead is quite impressive. In Q4 2024, AMD's data center revenue was $3.9 billion, up 69% year over year. Nvidia hasn't reported its Q4 results yet, as its financial calendar is shifted by one month. As a result, using AMD's Q3 results provides a better comparison.In Q3, AMD's data center revenue was $3.5 billion, up 122% year over year. These are impressive results by themselves, yet pale in comparison to Nvidia's.In Q3 FY 2025 (ending Oct. 27), Nvidia's data center revenue was $30.8 billion, up 112% year over year. That indicates Nvidia's data center business is around 10 times the size of AMD's, which is a massive lead. We'll learn more about Nvidia's Q4 results when it reports on Feb. 26, but with all the talk from big tech companies about AI spending, it's likely to report great numbers.Nvidia has built a massive moat with huge switching costs, which essentially blocks AMD from taking a meaningful amount of its data center business. However, if AMD is substantially cheaper as a stock, the discount could be enough of a reason to invest in AMD, as its data center business is still growing strongly, being much smaller than Nvidia.Because both companies are fully profitable, using an earnings-based metric like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio makes sense.From this perspective, AMD's stock looks far more expensive than Nvidia's, which it is. However, both companies are undergoing strong growth, and AMD's profit picture is set to improve throughout 2025, so using a forward P/E ratio is also a good idea.From this perspective, AMD is cheaper than Nvidia. However, the discrepancy between these two valuation levels can largely be attributed to the company-wide growth rate. Considering that Nvidia is expected to grow revenue by 52% in FY 2026 (ending January 2026) and AMD is expected to grow at a 24% pace, this difference seems reasonable.Nvidia is growing faster and dominating the most important computing market right now. While AMD is still a fine company, I don't think there's any reason to own AMD over Nvidia. Best-in-class stocks usually outperform their peers by a wide margin, especially when they start from a similar valuation point.Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasnt one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A potential encounter this week between President Xi Jinping and e-commerce icon Jack Ma, coming after a blistering run by tech shares, could be the next catalyst to extend the rally in Chinas stocks.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayProminent entrepreneurs including Ma have been invited to meet the nations top leaders, people familiar with the matter said last week. The potential show of support for the private sector coincides with the recent surge in equities in Hong Kong, driven by growing capabilities in artificial intelligence.The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped as much as 1.7% in early Monday trading, after reaching its highest level since February 2022 last Friday. A tech gauge in Hong Kong entered a bull market earlier this month, fueled by Chinese startup DeepSeeks AI model thats hailed as a game-changer.Such a high-profile endorsement sends a clear message of support from Chinas government, which views the tech sector as a future driver of economic growth, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea.One major driver of the rally is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., whose Hong Kong-listed shares have surged more than 60% since Jan. 13. Tencent Holdings Ltd. is also catching up, with its shares rising as much as 7.8% on Monday after the company said its integrating DeepSeeks artificial intelligence chatbot into WeChat. The stock is up almost 40% from a January low.Some investors say the rally is overcrowded and stretched, but Xis support would be a boost of confidence to the $16 trillion Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets that have enjoyed steady gains since mid-January.The recent developments align with our expectation of a short-term trading opportunity in the Chinese stock market, rather than signaling a structural shift, said Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. Nevertheless, without fresh catalysts from earnings, liquidity flows, or policy signals, the risk of a pullback is increasing.A meeting involving Xi and Ma can be a pivotal turning point for Alibaba since Beijing spiked Ant Group Co.s initial public offering at the 11th hour, halting what would have been the worlds biggest IPO, and marking the start of a regulatory campaign to rein in the sector that had grown perhaps too large and powerful for comfort. It would also send a powerful signal that Chinas Communist Party is adopting a more supportive stance toward private-sector companies.Crystal-Clear MessageHaving Jack Ma in particular would provide a symbolic end to the tech-sector crackdown, which essentially started with him back in 2020, said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. In practice, the crackdown has been over for a while now. But the optics of Xi telling Ma and other tech leaders to go forth and prosper would send a crystal-clear message that the governments stance has been completely reversed.China is well aware that innovation is the key driver for productivity growth. Xi has continuously pushed for new productive forces amid the US curbs on high-end chips to China. Thats only prompted Beijing to redouble efforts at self-sufficiency in cutting-edge technology.The valuation of the tech index doesnt appear frothy, given that the Hang Seng Tech gauge is trading at 18.2 times forward earnings, compared to 44.9 times four years ago.Chinese equities have been trading at extremely depressed valuations with most risks well discussed and reflected in the prices, said Sandy Pei, a senior portfolio manager for China equities at Federated Hermes. The DeepSeek event has acted as a catalyst, boosting sentiment around Chinese equities. Despite recent performance, the market remains attractively valued.DeepSeek has effectively boosted investor sentiment in Chinas tech sector, and the rally has been spreading beyond just tech into other sectors, including electric vehicle makers and health-care companies. Thats quite the opposite from what many Chinese investors have experienced in recent years, waiting for the government to boost the stock market, whether through stimulus roll-out or via trading purchases by ETFs known to be favored by the so-called national team.--With assistance from Lucille Liu, Henry Ren, Cecile Vannucci, Colum Murphy and John Cheng.(Updates with Mondays market moves.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "published": "2025-02-15T15:30:00Z",
        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) stock has been in scintillating form on the stock market over the past six months, rising a remarkable 55% as of this writing on the back of solid quarterly reports that point toward an improvement in the cybersecurity specialist's growth profile.Shares of the company received another shot in the arm after the release of its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 6. Fortinet stock was up nearly 3% following this report as revenue and earnings were well ahead of what analysts were anticipating. The guidance was the icing on the cake as Fortinet's 2025 outlook also exceeded consensus estimates.Should investors consider buying Fortinet stock right now following its recent rally in anticipation of more upside? Let's find out.The recent rally in Fortinet stock has brought its price-to-earnings ratio to 48, which is expensive when compared to the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's multiple of 34 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). The forward earnings multiple of 45 isn't cheap either, suggesting that analysts aren't expecting a huge increase in the company's bottom line this year.More specifically, analysts are predicting an increase of just 5% in Fortinet's earnings this year to $2.48 per share, which is a penny above the higher end of the company's guidance range. That's going to be much slower than Fortinet's 2024 earnings jump of 45%. It is worth noting that Fortinet completed three acquisitions last year, which positively impacted its billings and must have given its bottom line a boost as well.The company was originally anticipating 2024 earnings to land between $1.65 and $1.70 per share. Fortinet's earnings also benefited from a decline in inventory write-downs last year, which led to a sharp increase in its gross margin in 2024. So, Fortinet's robust earnings growth last year was driven by additional factors that are likely to be absent in 2025, thereby leading to much slower bottom-line growth.That's why investors who are looking to buy this cybersecurity stock right now may be concerned about its high valuation and slower pace of earnings growth. However, the following chart indicates that analysts are expecting an acceleration in Fortinet's earnings growth over the next couple of years.That doesn't seem surprising considering that Fortinet is gradually building a solid revenue pipeline, which should allow it to clock healthy revenue and earnings growth.Fortinet points out that it is the leading vendor in the network firewall security market, citing third-party estimates, with a market share of more than 50%. This puts Fortinet in a solid position to capitalize on the network firewall market that's expected to grow by nearly two-and-a-half fold through 2034.Additionally, Fortinet is gaining traction in the fast-growing unified secure access service edge (SASE), which combines networking and security into a single platform. Unified SASE is gaining traction thanks to the growing usage of cloud-based services as well as the surge in remote and hybrid work in recent years.This market is expected to clock 12% annual growth through 2029 and generate $17 billion in annual revenue, according to one estimate. The good part is that Fortinet seems to be growing at a faster pace than the unified SASE market. The company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) in unified SASE increased 21% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $1.45 billion.This metric refers to the total value of a company's contracts that are yet to be fulfilled. So, the pace at which Fortinet is signing contracts in unified SASE suggests that it is on track to corner a nice portion of this space in the long run.All this shows why analysts are forecasting an improvement in Fortinet's earnings growth. Assuming the company manages to generate $3.41 per share in earnings in 2027 and trades at 44 times earnings at that time (in line with its five-year average forward earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $150. That would be a jump of 39% from current levels.However, more upside cannot be ruled out if Fortinet manages to grow at a stronger pace thanks to its solid position in network security and impressive growth in the unified SASE space. So, investors can still consider buying this cybersecurity stock as it could sustain its impressive rally in the long run.Before you buy stock in Fortinet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Fortinet wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Last month, a new artificial intelligence (AI) model emerged and made headlines in the markets for its effectiveness and low cost. Chinese company DeepSeek said its AI chatbot performed similarly to ChatGPT and that it cost less than $6 million to develop, causing many to wonder whether tech giants are spending effectively when it comes to AI.One company that falls into that category is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which owns Google and has been developing its own chatbot, Gemini. But despite the alarm bells that DeepSeek has set off in the markets, one top Google executive doesn't appear all that concerned.Demis Hassabis is the CEO of Google DeepMind, which is involved with AI development at the tech company. Hassabis admits he was impressed with the DeepSeek AI model, but he also points out that it doesn't possess any game-changing abilities. \"Despite the hype, there's no actual new scientific advance,\" says Hassabis, trying to put into perspective just what the launch of DeepSeek might mean for the tech sector.The big news around DeepSeek wasn't that it was significantly better or more advanced than ChatGPT or Gemini, however. It was that a relatively unknown Chinese company, which is less than two years old and has around 200 employees, was able to catch up to big tech giants and develop an AI model at a much lower cost. That's the big takeaway from this -- that other tech companies that haven't been investing heavily to AI may not necessarily be at a huge disadvantage; they can now simply build off DeepSeek's open-source model.DeepSeek's AI model itself doesn't pose a huge threat to Gemini and other chatbots. Governments around the world have already banned it, or are in the process of doing so, because of privacy concerns. So while it may be a possible alternative to ChatGPT and Gemini, it may not end up being widely used. What Alphabet investors should be worried about, however, is whether the massive $75 billion Alphabet plans to invest in capital expenditures this year, as it focuses on AI development, will be money well spent. It's a big increase from the $52.5 billion the tech company spent on capital purchases in 2024. A more advanced Gemini chatbot may not be enough for Alphabet investors. What could be essential in helping push it higher is how well Alphabet is able to turn its investments into significant growth catalysts, perhaps by offering enhanced, AI-powered YouTube or Google Search capabilities that it can monetize. Even if DeepSeek may not necessarily be a big worry for Google, its ability to quickly bring a competitive product to market hasn't gone unnoticed in the markets. And that will put more of a spotlight on AI-related spending, which could have investors demanding to see results and a payoff from those investments sooner rather than later.Alphabet is a top tech company to invest in, and its products and services may get a big boost from AI. But getting to that point may be a bumpy ride for investors. I wouldn't be surprised to see tech companies start to scale back on spending and reduce headcount in an effort to respond to investor worries about heavy AI spending. When enthusiasm is strong and investors are bullish on AI, the spending can be easier to justify. But with investors concerned, especially in light of how advanced the DeepSeek AI model is, it may not be as easy for Alphabet and other tech companies to prove to investors that all their spending on AI is wise.If you're a risk-averse investor who isn't planning to hold on for the long haul, you may want to sit on the sidelines for now. Given how hot AI stocks have been in the past year, it's possible a correction is coming soon. Alphabet can still make for a good long-term investment, and it trades at a reasonable 23 times its trailing earnings, but in the short run, there could be significant volatility.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "The tech sector is home to some of the market's hottest growth stocks. But not all that glitters is gold, and chasing the herd can often result in painful long-term losses. So instead of simply investing in the highest-growth companies, investors should seek out companies with unique business models and wide moats.I believe these three growth stocks check the right boxes and could rise a lot higher over the next decade: cybersecurity company Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS), AI analytics company Innodata (NASDAQ: INOD), and fintech leader SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI).Zscaler develops zero trust cybersecurity services, which treat everyone, including a company's CEO, as a potential threat. Unlike other companies that use on-site appliances, Zscaler provides its tools as cloud-native services, which are stickier and easier to scale as an organization expands.From fiscal 2019 to 2024 (which ended in July 2024), Zscaler's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 48% as its adjusted net income rose at a CAGR of 76%. Its stock rallied nearly 250% over the past five years.From fiscal 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Zscaler's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 21%. Its growth is slowing down as its business matures and the macro headwinds make it tougher to land big deals, but it still has plenty of room to expand as more cybersecurity threats emerge.Its stock might not seem like a bargain at 12 times this year's sales, but I believe its growth potential justifies that higher valuation.Innodata was once considered a tiny and slow-growth analytics company. But in 2018, it launched a suite of task-specific microservices aimed at preparing data for AI applications. When a large company develops a new AI project, it often spends 80% of its time preparing that data and just 20% of the time training the actual AI algorithm.That's a waste of time for tech companies, which need to feed lots of data into their large language models (LLMs) and other AI tools. That's why five of the Magnificent Seven companies started using Innodata's microservices to prepare their data.From 2019 to 2023, Innodata's revenue grew at a CAGR of 12%. But from 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 42% as its clients process even more data for their AI applications. They also expect it to turn profitable and grow its net income at a CAGR of 23% over the following two years.Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at just 6 times next year's sales, and it could continue to grow like a weed as the AI market expands.SoFi operates a one-stop digital shop for personal loans, credit cards, insurance services, estate planning tools, and stock investment services. It also opened a digital-only direct bank after it obtained a U.S. bank charter in 2022.From the end of 2020 to the end of 2024, SoFi's number of members quadrupled from 2.52 million to 10.13 million. Its payment processing subsidiary Galileo, which it acquired in 2020, hosts 168 million accounts on its own. During those four years, its adjusted revenue grew at a CAGR of 43%. It also finaly turned profitable in 2024.SoFi continued to grow even as interest payments on student loans were paused from March 2020 to September 2023 and rising interest rates throttled the demand for other loans. But now that the freeze on student loans has thawed as interest rates are stabilizing, SoFi should continue to grow at a faster rate than its brick-and-mortar competitors.From 2024 to 2026, analysts expect SoFi's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 20% as its net income increases at a CAGR of 9%. It isn't expensive at 5 times this year's sales, and it could have plenty of room to grow as the fintech market expands.Before you buy stock in Innodata, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Innodata wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST) stock has been all over the place during the past few years, soaring to stardom before losing 90% of its value. It has more than doubled during the past year despite continuing net losses, though it's still down about 80% from its all-time highs.The market celebrated its fourth-quarter report, and 2025 could be a transition year for the fintech company. Let's see where it might be a year from now.Investors have been excited about Upstart because it offers something truly disruptive and valuable in a huge industry -- a credit evaluation platform it says can approve more loans without increasing risk to the lender. Increasing a lender's capacity to extend credit without adding risk of default is a game changer for the industry.However, higher interest rates have made it harder for the platform to identify more good borrowers. When rates are high, default risk is higher, too. Beyond that, demand for loans declines because fewer people are looking to borrow money when rates are high.Upstart's loan volume fell in recent years, but it increased 68% year over year in 2024's Q4. As rates fall and borrowing resumes, volume likely will increase more.In the meantime, Upstart is launching new products and expanding. It recently introduce its first home product, a home equity line of credit, and it's now live in several states and Washington D.C. Management is working on credit card products and innovative loan products, and its small-dollar loan product grew 115% year over year in the quarter.It added 28 lending partners to the platform in 2024, and that number should keep rising during the next 12 months.Revenue is a similar story to volume. Although it fell for about two years, it increased 56% year over year in Q4. For the full year, revenue rose 13%. Revenue follows business trends, and as business picks up, revenue should, too. Upstart is also improving the artificial intelligence (AI) models that power its platform, and management expects its newer models to be in operation as more people shop for loans.For 2025, management is projecting revenue of $200 million in Q1, or 56% more than last year, and $1 billion for the full year, or a 57% increase.The outlook is based on interest rates remaining unchanged. Interest rate reduction could easily lead Upstart to boost its forecast.Although volume and revenue are growing again, Upstart is still reporting net losses. That's not surprising, since profitability typically takes time for new businesses. Startups almost always need to reach a certain scale before positive net income follows.But the financial results are moving in the right direction. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $38.8 million in Q4, up from $600,000 last year, the second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. The net loss was $2.76 million, a big improvement from the net loss of $42.4 million a year earlier.The exciting news in the report was that Chief Executive Officer Dave Girouard said he expects Upstart to be \"at least breakeven\" based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by year-end.Upstart stock has been volatile since the company's initial public offering in December 2020, and that hasn't changed. It trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 12, which is quite pricey considering its financial position. There's some growth built into that price, but as Upstart recovers, the market thinks it will grow fast enough to warrant a rich price tag.Upstart's model should become the go-to for lenders over the next few years, and over time, it should be able to prove itself under more favorable macroeconomic conditions. I still wouldn't take a huge position in Upstart stock, but risk-tolerant investors could make a small purchase as the company begins its comeback. If everything goes the way management expects, Upstart stock could go much higher in 2025.Before you buy stock in Upstart, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Upstart wasnt one of them.

        "content": "A lot has changed at PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) recently. Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss took over a year and a half ago and set new strategies into motion, and the stock price is up more than 30% during the past year. It was up even more, but the shares fell after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings report last week.Investors had been excited about a turnaround, and there's been healthy progress, but the market was disappointed in the latest update.Revenue growth hasn't been PayPal's problem, although it has decelerated since the early days of the pandemic lockdowns, when everyone was shopping online and the company had some of its best quarters ever. In the latest quarter, revenue increased 4% year over year, and it was up 7% for the full year.An excellent indicator of how the business is doing is how its active accounts and monthly actives are changing over time.MetricQ1 2024Q2 2024Q3 2024Q4 2024Active accounts427 million429 million432 million434 millionActive accounts % change (YOY)(1%)0%1%2%Monthly active accounts220 million222 million223 million229 millionMonthly active accounts % change (YOY)2%3%2%2%Data source: PayPal. YOY = year over year.PayPal reached a peak of 435 million active customers in 2022's fourth quarter, and its loss of customers in subsequent periods was an indication of its slowing momentum. Now that metric is growing again. It's still not back to its peak level, but it's getting close. Engaging with customers is the first step to unlocking more of the platform's value.Top-line gains could continue to slow down in the near term as it prioritizes higher-margin growth over general revenue growth.What's been bothering investors about PayPal during the past few years is that despite its revenue growth, margins have been narrowing and profits have been underwhelming.Part of the problem is that a lot of its growth has been coming from its Braintree business, or what it calls \"unbranded checkout.\" Braintree was a company that PayPal acquired, and it provides white-label financial services to business clients. Because it's a type of wholesale business, its gross margins are lower than those of the PayPal branded checkout business. Since this is where volume has been growing, these lower margins are trickling through to the entire company.You'll notice that there's been a recent uptick, and that's because one of Chriss' goals has been to shift the company toward a price-to-value strategy -- basing prices on what customers view as the value of its services, as opposed to what they cost to deliver or the prices that rivals charge for similar offerings. He's working to price Braintree products at their true value to clients. That should widen margins, although it's also costing PayPal some business.The market wasn't thrilled with the fourth-quarter results. Management highlighted a 7% year-over-year increase in transaction margin dollars, or 5% adjusted. Operating income, however, fell by 17% year over year, and earnings per share (EPS) declined to $1.11, a 15% fall from a year earlier. Full-year EPS increased 4% to $3.99.Management has forecast for significant EPS increases for 2025's first quarter and for the full year. As the changes PayPal is making start kicking in, expect higher profit.Even though PayPal still doesn't have quite as many active accounts as it did at its peak, it has a vast active customer base that's more than the populations of the U.S. and Canada combined. It's starting from an excellent position, and if it can reengage customers who have fallen away, as well as increase its engagement with its existing base, it will be well on its way toward reigniting its business. The way it's doing that involves completely revamping its checkout options, and so far, the results have been positive.I envision incrementally higher engagement over the next year, along with more innovation and improved features to keep up with the competition. Chriss has proven adept at figuring out the tech part of this equation, which is the key to unlocking greater value from its active member base.Before Chriss's arrival, management was focused on adding customers at the expense of active customers. PayPal has flipped that dynamic, and although the number of active customers is now on the rise, the growth in the average number of transactions per customer is decelerating, and the total number of transactions declined year over year in the fourth quarter. Management says this is a short-term result of its pricing increases in the Braintree segment, and asserts that it will result in higher margins and profitability over time. Investors will want to keep an eye out for progress on that front over the next year.At its current price, PayPal stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of  about 19 -- close to a 10-year low. That looks like a great entry point for investors who have been on the fence.Although you can never know with certainty where any stock will be in a year, PayPal's outlook is harder to predict than average because there's so much about the company that is in flux. I see it continuing to demonstrate steady progress, and its new CEO is inspiring confidence. Although PayPal stock isn't a great candidate for the risk-averse investor, it should reward patient investors over the next year and beyond.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "It's very possible for cryptocurrencies to spend a bit too much time in the spotlight, leaving latecomers to crypto investing to take heavy losses, when having a bit of foresight would have spared them a lot of pain.In that vein, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) is currently priced around $2.50 (as of Feb. 13), but is it still worth an investment if its price surges higher than $3 this year? Let's investigate this question, because in many ways, it isn't even the right thing to be asking.XRP's price today is, like all other cryptocurrencies and publicly traded assets, determined largely by the psychology of the investors buying, selling, and holding it.People buy and hold assets they think will be worth more in the future; they sell assets they think will be worth less. The fair market value of an asset itself on any given day is just a representation of where the center point is in the endless tug-of-war between buyers willing to pay a bit more for the asset just to hold it, and sellers willing to get a bit less just to get cash instead.If the price of a digital coin like XRP goes up over time, it's because there's more money that wants to acquire the coin and keep it than there is money locked up in the coin that wants to escape into cash. In other words, investors are, on average, more hopeful about getting more money by waiting and holding the coin than they are fearful of losing the equivalent amount of cash. Why would investors think this?For one, if there's a solid investment thesis for an asset, which describes how and why the asset will be worth more in the future than it is today, it goes a long way toward getting investors to hold. But think for a moment about what that implies about the price on any given day.If you thought this means the price itself simply doesn't matter much, only the sentiment about where it's going, you're on the right track. And that's precisely how you should be thinking about whether to invest in XRP.Whether XRP is above $1, $2, or $3 is immaterial to whether it can continue to gain in value from any given point. As long as there's a good set of reasons suggesting that it will continue to produce value, it has a clear runway to continue increasing from whatever price it's at to whatever arbitrary price point you pick in the future.That doesn't mean it's guaranteed to go up, just that spending time analyzing the price of the coin at any one point in time is much less fruitful than understanding the factors driving its rise, which we'll get into next.As it turns out, XRP has a good chance of rising above $3 and beyond in the future because it's a good cryptocurrency investment.The coin is used by financial institutions including Santander and JPMorgan Chase to process transfers of money across international borders. Using XRP is useful for these businesses because it enables them to avoid paying hefty international wire-transfer fees, and it allows transactions to close within a few minutes instead of a few days.It also enables those companies to avoid paying international currency exchange fees, which are levied as a percentage of a transfer's total value, and which therefore tend to be major expenses.And that's why XRP's blockchain processed more than $5.1 billion in transactions in the 24-hour period ended on Feb. 11. Each of those transactions generated a small quantity of fees that goes toward maintaining and upgrading the network.It's clear that there's a lot of institutional buy-in here already. More adoption is likely on the way, especially if regulators approve new financial instruments that hold XRP in traditional financial accounts, like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).In other words, there's ample reason for investors to be optimistic about XRP being more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Jump ahead five or six years, and it might be vastly more valuable, especially if it can continue to beat out competition from other fintechs trying to gain ground in international money transfers.If you buy it today and hold it for that long, you probably won't even remember when the price crosses $3. Keeping a healthy long-term view of your investments tends to make you forget what the price was during any given period, especially when you still have evidence that they'll be worth even more in the future.Before you buy stock in XRP, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and XRP wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The energy sector can be a great source of durable passive income if you know where to look. While commodity price volatility can affect the cash flows of many energy companies, others have business models designed to mute the impact of that volatility on their earnings, so they can generate steadier cash flow to help support their growing dividends. Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP) have been dividend stalwarts in the energy sector over the decades. They're in strong positions to continue paying high-yielding and steadily rising dividends in the future. That makes them great energy stocks to buy for passive income right now. Enbridge has paid dividends for more than 70 years. This will mark the 30th consecutive year it has increased its dividend. Enbridge has grown its payout at a 9% compound annual rate over the past three decades, including 3.1% this year. The Canadian pipeline and utility company's dividend currently yields an attractive 5.9%. The energy company backs its high-yielding payout with a very low-risk financial profile. About 98% of the company's earnings come from stable cost-of-service or contracted assets. Meanwhile, the company pays a reasonable 60% to 70% of its stable cash flow in dividends. Enbridge also has a strong investment-grade balance sheet with a leverage ratio trending toward the low end of its target range. The company's conservative financial profile puts its dividend on a very sustainable foundation. It also provides Enbridge with lots of financial flexibility to expand its energy infrastructure operations. It currently has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured capital projects under construction that should enter service through 2029. These projects primarily support lower carbon energy, like new natural gas pipelines, natural gas utility expansions, and renewable energy projects.That backlog provides Enbridge with lots of visibility into its growth potential. It expects to grow its cash flow per share at a 3% compound annual rate through 2026 and by around 5% per year after that. This growth should support dividend increases in the 3% to 5% annual range. Brookfield Renewable has grown its dividend by a 6% compound annual rate since 2001. Meanwhile, this year marked the 14th straight year that Brookfield Renewable has increased its dividend by at least 5%. The leading global renewable energy producer's dividend currently yields 5.5%. That high-yielding payout is also on a very sustainable foundation. Brookfield Renewable produces very stable cash flow because it sells the bulk of the power it produces under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with utilities and large corporate customers. Since most of those PPAs link rates to inflation, its large power generation portfolio produces stable and growing cash flow of about 2% to 3% annually. Inflation-linked rate increases are only one growth driver. Brookfield also expects to capture higher market rates for electricity as its existing PPAs expire. Margin enhancement activities like that should add another 2% to 4% to its cash flow per share each year. On top of that, Brookfield is investing heavily in developing additional renewable energy capacity. It has a staggering 200 gigawatts (GW) of projects in its development pipeline, more than four times its current operating capacity of 46 GW. The company expects to ramp up its development capabilities from 7 GW last year to 10 GW annually by 2027. These projects should add 4% to 6% to its cash flow per share each year. Finally, Brookfield has a long track record of making accretive acquisitions. The company and its partners deployed or committed to deploy a record $12.5 billion -- $1.8 billion net to Brookfield -- into new businesses last year. It has ample liquidity to continue making new investments as opportunities arise. Brookfield believes its growth drivers will power more than 10% annual cash flow per share growth for the next decade. That should enable it to continue growing its dividend in the 5% to 9% annual range. Enbridge and Brookfield Renewable have proven the durability of their dividends over the decades. The companies produce very stable cash flow and have conservative financial profiles, which puts their high-yielding dividends on rock-solid ground. With lots of financial flexibility to capitalize on the abundance of opportunities to continue expanding their operations, they should be able to continue increasing their high-yielding dividends in the decades ahead. That makes them ideal passive income stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.

        "content": "Vanguard ETF are some of the most popular exchange-traded funds among investors, and for good reasons. Not only are there Vanguard ETFs that allow you to invest in virtually any stock market index, sector, or category of stocks, fixed-income, or commodities you want, but Vanguard funds give everyday investors a cost-effective way to do it.Some Vanguard ETFs have expense ratios as low as 0.03%, which means the annual costs of a $1,000 investment are just $0.30. To be clear, an ETF's expense ratio isn't a fee you have to pay. It will simply be reflected in the fund's performance over time.As of this writing, there are 88 different Vanguard ETFs listed on the firm's website. And to be clear, there's a solid investment case to be made for most of them, especially for long-term investors trying to build a diversified portfolio. However, there are some that could be better ways to put your $1,000 to work than others. Here are three in particular that look interesting right now.Regardless of stock market conditions or the economic climate, it's tough to make the case against owning the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) as a long-term investment. This ETF tracks the S&P 500 benchmark index, which is widely considered to be the best overall barometer of how the U.S. stock market is doing.Over long periods of time, the S&P 500 has produced annualized returns of 9%-10%, depending on the exact period you're looking at. To put this in perspective, a $1,000 investment compounded at 10% for 40 years would be worth more than $45,000. Now imagine if you invest $1,000 in the S&P 500 at regular intervals over time. It's important for new investors to realize that not all stock market millionaires get that way by choosing individual stocks. Many get there by simply buying the S&P 500, investing regularly, and holding for a long time.While real estate is one of the official stock market sectors, it is often considered to be a different asset class than stocks. The Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) tracks an index mostly composed of real estate investment trusts, or REITs (pronounced \"reets\"). Just to name a few of the largest REITs you might have heard of, Prologis (NYSE: PLD) owns over a billion square feet of warehouses, Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) owns thousands of self-storage properties, and Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) owns some of the busiest shopping malls in the world.In order to be classified as a REIT, a company must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders, which makes these excellent dividend stocks. As of this writing, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF has a dividend yield of about 3.8%. Over the long term, the combination of dividend income and appreciation of real estate values can result in excellent total returns.Last but certainly not least, the Vanguard ETF I have been buying for my own portfolio recently is the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO). This tracks the Russell 2000 index, which is the most popular index of small cap stocks in the market.There are a few reasons why the Russell 2000 looks especially attractive right now. For one thing, small caps can be major beneficiaries of falling interest rates, as smaller companies (as a group) are more debt-reliant than their large-cap counterparts. They could also be big winners of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce regulations on businesses.It's also worth mentioning that small cap stocks are trading for their lowest valuations on a price-to-book basis, relative to large caps, in over 25 years. The average Russell 2000 stock trades for a price-to-book multiple of 2.0, while the typical S&P 500 component has a P/B of 4.8. The last time the valuation gap was this wide was in 1999, and small caps went on to outperform for more than a decade.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Are you on the hunt for a few good growth stocks? Here's a little secret: The longer you can hold them, the more likely you are to reap their full reward.Or, as the brilliant Benjamin Graham once explained it, \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.\" It just means that while a company's true value eventually shines through, a stock's price can be unpredictably erratic in the near term.To this end, here's a closer look at three brilliant growth stocks that are not only solid long-term prospects but are arguably best utilized as long-haul positions.Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) isn't a household name, but there's a good chance you or someone in your household regularly benefits from its technology. This company supplies the semiconductor industry with the software and foundry tools like etching, cleaning, and measurement equipment required to manufacture state-of-the-art silicon.Such advanced products weren't always necessary. As other aspects of computers have improved, however, the need for higher-performance chips has exploded. Better manufacturing processes have proven one of the best ways for semiconductors to rise to the occasion, so to speak. That's why Lam Research sells on the order of $16 billion worth of this technology per year, although its top line can be inconsistent at times.Sure, the stock's been a subpar performer since the middle of last year, when it became clear its business was running into a cyclical headwind after a fantastic growth streak just the year before.Now, take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The world's reliance on chips is only going to continue growing, particularly now that artificial intelligence is proving itself.The thing is, each generation of this silicon is going to be expected to be better than the last. For that to happen, the industry is going to need to get better and better at extracting maximum performance from a minimal amount of material. Lam Research is one of only a few names in the support and equipment sliver of the semi manufacturing business that can effectively help make that happen.Speaking of artificial intelligence, most investors recognize that this game-changing technology is here to stay, and rightfully so. Some investors may have even tinkered with consumer-friendly AI-powered apps like ChatGPT or Microsoft's Copilot.The real monetization potential of artificial intelligence is on the enterprise front. However, it helps institutional-sized organizations make good use of the mountains of digital data they've been gathering for years.Enter Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR).In simplest terms, Palantir provides data-driven decision-making services; you know these better as artificial intelligence platforms. More than just a bunch of well-arranged data nuggets, this company's tech seems to understand the more nuanced, complex, and arbitrary details that aren't quantifiable in even the most advanced spreadsheets. From tactical assistance on a field of combat to analysis of investment portfolios to the optimization of oil and gas drilling assets (and more), Palantir's platforms provide real value.This isn't merely theoretical software. Palantir Technologies has been selling commercialized access to its tech for some time. It even partnered with the U.S. Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services during the COVID-19 pandemic to make the agencies' effort to curb the contagion more effective, in many ways putting the up-and-coming company on the proverbial map.There's still more opportunity for growth ahead of it than behind it, though. Industry research outfit Precedence Research says the decision intelligence market is poised to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 16% through 2034.As a market leader, however, Palantir looks positioned to capture more of this growth. Analysts are calling for top-line growth of more than 32% this year to slow to a still-impressive 26% next year en route to 2027 revenue growth of a little more than 40%. Earnings are projected to improve at a similar pace.Last but not least, add Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) to your list of brilliant growth stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.It's another name you've probably never heard of. As was the case with Palantir Technologies and Lam Research, though, don't let that dissuade you. Customers are going to need its technological solutions a great deal more in the immediate future than in the recent past.Wolfspeed makes a range of silicon carbide solutions, from power modules to diodes to MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors). That won't mean much to most people, but this will: Silicon carbide tolerates more heat and higher voltage than ordinary silicon does, thus allowing it to be used for higher-voltage and higher-amperage applications like electric vehicles, data center power supplies, solar power systems, and EV charging stations, just to name a few.While it's not a brand-new application of a fairly simple idea, the benefits of this resilient silicon-based material are just now starting to be fully appreciated. That's why Global Market Insights expects the worldwide silicon carbide market to grow from last year's $4.2 billion to $80.2 billion by 2034.Being one of only a few names in the business -- not to mention one of the biggest -- Wolfspeed has much to look forward to over the course of the coming decade. Indeed, it might take that long for this company to work its way out of the red and into full profitability mode.It's arguably worth the wait, though, at least according to the analyst community. The current consensus price target stands at $9.07, which is 76% better than the stock's present price. You should be looking further down the road than this target is, but that's still not a bad tailwind to start a new position.Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 is near its all-time high. The deadline for funding the U.S. government is rapidly approaching with no budget deal finalized yet. Inflation rose more than expected in January. Many economists predict that President Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to increase even more.Am I selling stocks hand over fist in light of all the uncertainty? Nope. Here's why I've backed the truck and loaded up on these three high-yield dividend stocks.If I were focused only on the near term, I might not touch shares of Honda Motor (NYSE: HMC) with a 10-foot pole. The auto stock is down 20% over the last 12 months. Honda's planned acquisition of Nissan fell through. Tariffs could negatively impact the company, too.However, I think Honda's long-term prospects remain strong. The 2024 Axios Harris Poll 100 ranked Honda as the most reputable vehicle brand in the U.S. market. Honda's brand came in seventh place overall in the survey. Like its vehicles and power equipment, Honda is built to last.There are reasons to like Honda in the short term, too. Its forward dividend yield of 5.15% is a big plus for the stock. The company is also committed to stock buybacks, recently repurchasing nearly 121.5 million shares.I also suspect that tariffs won't hurt Honda as much as some expect. President Trump paused his planned 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico. If this delay becomes permanent (which I think is likely), Honda's shares could rebound since around 80% of the company's vehicles made in Mexico are sold in the U.S.I also recently got a bigger piece of the rock and added to my position in Prudential Financial (NYSE: PRU). It gives me comfort knowing the financial services company has been in business for over 145 years and is still going strong.This longevity isn't the main reason I invested more in Prudential, though. I like the stock's valuation with shares trading below 7.6 times forward earnings. That's much lower than the average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.4 for the S&P 500 financial sector.I'd be lying if I said Prudential's juicy forward dividend yield of 4.87% wasn't enticing. So is the company's track record of 17 consecutive years of dividend increases. Prudential's stock buybacks (almost $3 billion last year) add to the attraction.Could President Trump's focus on deregulation help Prudential? The chances look pretty good to me. The first Trump administration lifted Prudential from extensive government oversight as a systemically important financial institution. I wouldn't be surprised if the company benefits from further relaxation of regulations in Trump's second term.I'll readily admit that I bought more shares of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) largely because of its dividend program. The telecommunications giant has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years. Verizon's forward dividend yield stands at 6.7%, which gives it a big head start in delivering double-digit percentage total returns.Valuation was another key consideration. Verizon's shares trade at below 8.7 times forward earnings, which is significantly cheaper than the multiple of top rival AT&T.Importantly, Verizon's business is strong. Total broadband connections jumped 15% year over year during Q4. Wireless service revenue rose 3.1% year over year in Q4, marking 18 consecutive quarters of sequential growth.I also think artificial intelligence (AI) is important to Verizon's growth strategy. The company is using AI to increase its operational efficiency and boost profitability. It's offering AI tools to personalize customer experiences. Edge AI apps running close to the edge of networks could also provide a major tailwind for Verizon. CEO Hans Vestberg said in the Q4 earnings call that edge AI \"has already created an opportunity for us as we had revenue and EBITDA impact in the fourth quarter.\"Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasnt one of them.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON) is finally breaking up. The rationale for the breakup makes perfect sense, and it could release a lot of value for investors. Still, does that make the stock a buy right now? Here's what you need to know before deciding on the stock.Having previously announced the spinoff of its advanced materials business (due in late 2025 or early 2026), Honeywell's management decided to take the next step and separate its automation and aerospace businesses in the second half of 2026. As of yet, it's not clear which company will be the \"RemainCo.\"The breakup is pretty much along the lines that activist investors have been pushing for. Indeed, Elliott Investment Management pushed for change at Honeywell, arguing that a breakup could lead to a value per share between $321 (base case scenario) and $383 by the end of 2026 -- figures representing a 54% and an 84% increase on the price at the time of writing.Elliott's case rests on believing that Honeywell's businesses would be better run as separate companies than within a conglomerate structure. In addition, Elliott's argument, echoed by many other investors, is that the market would grant the separate businesses higher valuation multiples. The prescription is simple: Break up the company, and the businesses will generate higher earnings, which would be valued more.In short, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.Naturally, Wall Street analysts were interested in asking about the subject, with Morgan Stanley's Chris Snyder inquiring as to the primary driver of the decision. CEO Vimal Kapur argued that it was a strategic decision based on the increasing divergence in the needs of aerospace and automation, with Honeywell Aerospace needing to work on capacity expansion and supply chain transformation and Honeywell Automation needing to focus on artificial intelligence, digital transformation, and energy security.Kapur argued, \"It's primarily driven by our conviction that there's more growth momentum and more value to create as a separate company.\" .Kapur's argument is fair enough, and it's what you might expect a CEO to say. After all, he's responsible for Honeywell's operational performance and can't control how the market values the stock. This is not to argue that CEOs don't keep a close eye on valuations; after all, generating shareholder value is key, and a stock's valuation does influence its ability to raise capital or sell equity.Moreover, Honeywell named its \"representative comparable companies\" in its earnings presentation, and when you compare them with Honeywell, there appears to be a compelling case that Honeywell is undervalued.First, here's how Honeywell stacks up against the named comparable aerospace companies in terms of forward enterprise value, or EV (market cap plus net debt), to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).Second, here's Honeywell with its named comparable automation companies.The answer is yes, but not as much as the charts suggest. For starters, Honeywell Aerospace's 26% segment margin is nowhere near TransDigm's near 53% EBITDA margin. Moreover, GE Aerospace has 74% of its revenue coming from commercial aerospace compared to 60% for Honeywell, and the former has several decades of lucrative aftermarket revenue coming from servicing its engines on commercial narrowbody and widebody planes. The same is true of RTX. Meanwhile, Honeywell Aerospace is more about avionics, propulsion systems, and business jet engines.Turning to Honeywell Automation, a business that combines industrial and building automation, Rockwell is more of a comparable pure-play automation company, while Emerson Electric has made great strides to become one with investments in industrial software and automated testing and measurement. Johnson Controls is a pure-play building automation, software, and controls company. Honeywell Automation also has its warehouse automation and productivity solutions and services business, which reported 5% and 7% organic sales declines in the fourth quarter.All told the breakup makes sense, and the sum-of-the-parts argument does apply, but not by as much as many investors might think it will. There are reasons why Honeywell trades at a discount to many of its peers, and it's not just because of the conglomerate structure.As such, investors must be patient and hope management can improve earnings over time. Honeywell looks like a decent value, but buying it depends on management's execution rather than the prospect of a valuation expansion resulting from a breakup.Before you buy stock in Honeywell International, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Honeywell International wasnt one of them.

The plane maker has been trying to revive production that was dented last year by a strike, and an accident that raised concerns about the safety of its jets.In January, Boeing's shares rallied after the company said it was making progress to stabilize production, despite a $11.8 billion loss.Some other investors also placed bets that Boeing's share price will rise. Soros Fund Management, the family office of billionaire George Soros, increased its stake in the plane maker, while macro hedge fund Discovery Capital Management unveiled a new stake.The $45.3 billion equities long/short hedge fund showed a new stake in carmaker General Motors, with 2.6 million shares worth $137.4 million.FINANCIALSAndreas Halvorsen's hedge fund reinforced bets on financials, increasing stakes in JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Charles Schwab.JPMorgan's was Viking's biggest stake in dollar amount at the end of December, worth $1.8 billion, the filing showed. The fund roughly doubled its stake to 7.5 million shares.It also had over $1 billion in positions in Bank of America and Schwab.The fund's positions were revealed in quarterly securities filings known as 13Fs.

Earnings per share increased 2.5%, to $1.23.The Pittsburgh-based companys order backlog was $7.68 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to a year ago.The Wabtec team delivered a strong 2024 as evidenced by higher orders, sales, margin expansion, increased earnings and robust cash flow, Chief Executive Rafael Santana said in a statement.I am encouraged by the underlying momentum of our business, and the teams unrelenting focus on execution and delivering for our customers. And just as importantly, we continue to lay a solid foundation for us to build upon. Looking ahead, I believe Wabtec is well positioned to drive top quartile returns over time, he added.Wabtec is in discussions with Class I railroads regarding orders for new locomotives as well as additional modernization programs for older units, executives said.In the fourth quarter, Wabtec won $1 billion worth of orders for new locomotives and modernizations. The North American modernization orders include $165 million from Ferromex of Mexico and $190 million split between two unnamed Class I railroads.In addition, Wabtec has taken orders worth $74 million for upgrading Trip Optimizer and Locotrol on locomotives in North America.Internationally, Wabtec recently received new locomotive orders worth $401 million from six customers, as well as a $248 million order for the Simandou mining project in West Africa.Most of Wabtecs fourth-quarter growth, however, came from its Transit segment. Transit revenue was up 7.1% for the quarter thanks to original equipment and aftermarket sales.The companys five-year outlook includes mid-single-digit growth in sales, a 3.5-point improvement in profit margin, and double-digit growth in earnings per share. The profit margin expansion is expected to come primarily from cost improvements and the pruning of lower-margin product lines.Related coverage:US rail volume still up in latest weekly statisticsTax credit would upgrade, expand US rail freight car fleet Short line eyes Cali market, buys hydrogen locomotive builderThe post Wabtecs earnings and outlook disappoint Wall Street appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "Unless youve been living under a rock for the past year, youll know there is one man out there who plans on changing everything. Whether it be cultural pastimes, corporate balance sheets, national budgets, or even international capitalism, Donald Trump wields unprecedented influence on the financial arena and all market participants. Whether you love or hate him, the all-conquering former real-estate tycoon is now the most powerful man in the world, drafting policy initiatives that could terraform international economics to the same degree as the Marshall Plan. The same man also happens to be the co-owner of a NASDAQ-listed media and tech company called Truth Social (DJT) while serving his second term as U.S. President.Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  Your Smart PortfolioWhat are the chances of this stock providing upside for investors in the short-term or value for long-term investors?Surprisingly, roughly 50% of Donald Trumps net worth is tied up in Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT), also known as Truth Social, or TMTG. Trumps total stake in DJT is worth about $4 billion. While DJT stock has clear upside potential driven by speculative fervor surrounding Trumps celebrity status, I remain neutral on the investment because the underlying business is highly overvalued and unrealistic.And thats precisely the point: DJT is a purely politically motivated sentiment-driven spec play on one of historys most iconic political figures. The idea is that despite the gruesome performance metrics underpinning DJT, Donald Trumps position and influence will protect the stocks value irrespective of everything else  simply because he is the U.S. President and has the power to do so.DJT posted just $3.4 million in revenue over the last 12 months but carries a market cap of $6.6 billiona valuation unmistakably inflated by marketing hype rather than financial performance. Broadly speaking, this stocks fundamentals are awful  from an accountants perspective. Currently, DJT stock is rated as Underperform and scores 1 out of 10 on TipRanks Smart Score.From a pro-Trump investors perspective, DJTs bloated valuation and balance sheet malaise can be reconciled with the stroke of a pen and the publication of a press release from the U.S. President or his entourage.Trump has been making strong political moves, including securing the return of Hamass hostages, pushing for peace negotiations in Ukraine, and maintaining a stable but firm relationship with China. However, political success doesnt guarantee success for DJT stockunless the market continues to push its price higher based on sentiment rather than substance.The companys primary asset, Truth Social, has just 2 million monthly active users, a fraction of the 600 million on X or the 3.98 billion across Metas platformsmaking it a relatively puny competitor in social media.Further afield, DJT also plans to expand into financial services with Truth.Fi, a fintech brand offering investment products focusing on cryptocurrencies. While this venture could unlock significant upside, it remains highly speculative. That said, Trumps connections with prominent tech figures, such as Elon Musk and other billionaire entrepreneurs, could eventually turn DJTs financial arm into something far more substantial.The proposed push into ETFs is an excellent example of potential price catalysts coming down the track for DJT. For bullish speculators, the hope is that Trump and Musk push financial access and crypto acceptance into total ubiquity while pocketing enormous rewards for themselves.Currently, DJTs price action is inextricably tied to the news cycle and Trumps political activities rather than the companys fundamentals. For example, in October 2024, DJT surged 130% purely on investor optimism surrounding Trumps electoral prospects. However, post-election, the stock struggled to maintain its gainsa sign of caution in the market regarding its long-term investment case.The real turning point for DJT could be its financial division. If Truth.Fi generates meaningful compounded returns; sentiment-driven investors will realize there is value in DJT after all. Additionally, if Trump continues to broker geopolitical stability and remains highly visible alongside power players like Larry Ellison, Rupert Murdoch, Sam Altman, and Elon Musk, DJTs momentum could be sustained purely on sentiment and brand value.Its no secret that were in an era where fundamentals dont rule the market. While fundamentals remain the ultimate driver of long-term value, were seeing stocks with massive valuation multiples for extended periods without a single profitable dollar to show for it. Trumps startup could still sustain high valuation multiples simply because Trump is the most famous person on the planet with a knack for surprising everyone. This makes DJT an ideal speculative investmentbut to turn sentiment into sustainable long-term value, its financial services arm must deliver.High-multiple stocks can sustain elevated valuations but remain highly vulnerable to volatility, particularly in response to macroeconomic conditions and operational setbacks. Timing is key for any potential DJT investors, with short-term entries and exits possibly being a viable strategy. However, getting caught in the price gyrations likely to ensue this year will be precarious.From a technical perspective, DJT looks moderately bearish right now. The 50-day moving average has exceeded the 200-day moving average, signaling short-term upward momentum. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing 40, indicating the stock is under selling pressure. Better entry points may emerge in the near term. On TipRanks, the technical sentiment on DJT is skewed to the downside.Ultimately, DJT is a sentiment-driven stock that doesnt align with my investment strategy. I seek to allocate capital toward highly productive businesses with strong cash flows and reasonable valuations relative to their fundamental performance. However, for those with greater risk appetite than I and those who want an exciting entry into political intrigue via the stock market, then DJT may just be the ticket. Allocating a small portion of ones portfolio to DJT simply for the joyride could appeal to politically astute speculators.Wall Street analysts have not issued any public ratings on DJT, mainly because the company has generated minimal revenue and substantial losses since its inception. Its latest income statement reports $3.4 million in trailing 12-month revenue and a net loss of $372.4 million.Given its speculative nature and lack of fundamental support, DJTs extreme market volatility has kept it off Wall Streets priority list as analysts focus on more established businesses.While Truth Social lacks significant growth potential, Truth.Fi has a real opportunity to create long-term value if it is correctly executed. The Trump brand alone adds intangible asset value, which could keep DJT trading at a premium for an extended period.Moreover, if Trump lives up to his promises and changes the way America operates, including legitimizing cryptocurrencies, boosting the domestic U.S. labor market, protecting domestic industries, fastracking AI infrastructure, and funding large-scale building projects, the potential rewards of those enterprises could be immense, for the U.S. as a nation, the man himself, DJT as a company and DJT investors to boot. Winners all around.However, for value investors like me, DJTs value is far too intangible to warrant an investment. As the most powerful man in the world, the U.S. President wields tremendous influence, making DJT a speculative swing for the fences that could end up paying off for investors. However, it could all turn to tears if outcomes dont match giddy aspirations  which is often the case in politics and economics. In fact, most hypes, memes, and fads tend to come and go rather quickly while reminding investors that what looks too good to be true usually is, especially in the stock market.Disclosure"

        "content": "Rumble (NASDAQ: RUM) stock is slumping in Wednesday's trading. The company's share price was down 3.9% as of 3 p.m. ET and had been down as much as 5.8% earlier in the day.Rumble's valuation is moving lower in conjunction with insider selling disclosures submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday. The stock is also seeing pressures related to the higher-than-anticipated inflation in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Rumble submitted a series of filings to the SEC disclosing recent stock sales from company managers and members of its board of directors. On Feb. 7, CEO Christopher Pavlovski sold 354,849 shares of Rumble Class A common stock at a price of $7.50 per share. Following the sale, Pavlovski owned 522,927 shares of the company's class A common stock and also held much larger positions in other share classes. Chief Financial Officer Brandon Alexandroff also sold more than 8.8 million shares of class A common stock at a price of $7.50 per share on Feb. 7. Meanwhile, Chief Content Officer Ramolo Claudio sold more than 6.2 million shares of class A common stock at $7.50 per share, and Chief Operating Officer Tyler Hughes sold more than 312,000 shares at the same price. Five other company officials and board members also sold stock on Feb. 7. In addition to the insider selling news, Rumble stock is also seeing pressures connected to inflation news today. The latest core CPI data showed that inflation came in at 3.3% in January, which topped the average estimate for inflation of 3.2% in the month. Meanwhile, the core CPI increased at a sequential monthly rate of 0.4% -- ahead of the average economist forecast for an increase of 0.3%.With the latest inflation data, investors are starting to think that it's more likely that the Federal Reserve will hold off on any additional interest rate cuts this year. For Rumble and other growth-dependent companies operating at losses, that could mean a more challenging valuation backdrop.Before you buy stock in Rumble, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rumble wasnt one of them.

        "content": "This story was originally published on CFO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter. San Jose, California-based Super Micro Computer said it had received subpoenas late last year from the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission which were seeking certain documents following the publication of allegations in a short seller report published in August, according to a securities filing and release Tuesday. The company disclosed the requests as part of an announcement on preliminary unaudited results for its Q2.The AI server makers accounting has drawn scrutiny in the wake of a highly critical report from the now defunct Hindenburg Research on Aug. 27. Subsequently, the company delayed its 10-K filing for its fiscal 2024 to assess internal controls and its auditor EY resigned and was replaced with BDO. In December, the outlook appeared to brighten when the SEC granted it an extension to file this month without risking delisting and separately, an internal probe of the integrity of the companys audit committee and management found no evidence of misconduct even as it recommended the company transition to a new CFO.  The company did not respond to a request for comment on the subpoenas, but noted in the filing it was cooperating with the agencies request for documents. Nicole Wright, an associate professor at James Madison Universitys School of Accounting, said it is highly likely that an investigation has been launched by both the SEC and DOJ. Subpoenas dont always mean an investigation is underway, but given the high publicity, the resignation of the independent auditors, and the impact on investors when EY walked away  I would be very surprised if the SEC and DOJ arent investigating, she wrote in an email.In a Tuesday conference call on preliminary unaudited results for the companys fiscal Q2 period ended Dec. 31, Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said he was confident that the 10-K and 10-Qs of two quarters of fiscal 2025 would be filed by the Feb. 25 extended deadline. He also asserted the company will continue to add more top experienced leaders to build a stronger corporate foundation for our rapidly growing and expanding global business, including the CFO, CCO and other positions.The company also reported mixed preliminary financial information for its Q2 that included some signs of strong growth. It expects fiscal Q2 net sales to be in $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion range, reflecting 54% year-over-year growth. Looking ahead, Liang expects fiscal year 2025 revenue in the $23.5 billion to $25 billion range, rising to $40 billion in 2026. With our leading direct-liquid cooling (DLC) technology and over 30% of new data centers expected to adopt it in the next 12 months, Super Micro is well positioned to grow AI infrastructure, Liang said in a statement included in the release. At the same time, the companys filing also revisited some previous accounting, saying it needed to make adjustments to preliminary unaudited results in the Q4 of fiscal 2024 announced in August, including a charge related to an increase in inventory reserves of about $45 million related to an unexpected decline in the market value of certain components. Collectively, these changes resulted in a downward adjustment to the previously announced preliminary unaudited fiscal year 2024 and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share of approximately $0.09 based on post-split diluted shares outstanding, the filing states. The foregoing adjustments are to previously announced preliminary unaudited financial results and, as such, do not constitute a restatement.JPMorgan analysts writing in a Tuesday report said the fiscal Q2 earnings fell short in terms of revenue and margins, but called the updated outlook for fiscal Q425 and fiscal 2026 a nice upside surprise. Super Micro remains in a strong position in the AI server market with next-generation GPUs and broader technical capabilities encompassing areas like liquid cooling, but the SEC compliance issues raise challenges around working capital that the company has to manage while looking to preserve their market leadership, the report states.  A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment and the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment."

The growth was largely seasonal as most of the enterprise business occurs towards the year's end, Steil said.On the U.S. market, he noted slightly improved sentiment among the company's customers and partners following the presidential election there. Prior to the election, TeamViewer had experienced uncertainty and slower purchasing from its customers.The Americas region contributes about 35% of the company's total revenue.($1 = 0.9653 euros)(Reporting by Amir Orusov, additional reporting by Anastasiia Kozlova; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"

Analysts had predicted a figure at the bottom end of that range.The company  the largest seller of networking gear  also raised its fiscal 2025 target by about $1 billion to just more than $56 billion. That compared with a $55.97 billion average estimate.Corporate clients have been bolstering their networking systems to help speed the creation and use of artificial intelligence. The outlook suggests that spending by those customers is helping make up for weaker orders from the federal government, which had put some projects on hold after the change of administration in Washington.As AI becomes more pervasive, we are well positioned to help our customers scale their network infrastructure, increase their data capacity requirements and adopt best-in-class AI security, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in the statement.Cisco shares climbed as much as 6.4% after markets opened in New York on Thursday, their biggest same-day gain in six months.Ciscos switches and routers are the key pieces of equipment that direct data traffic in and out of networks and around the internet. The company has also pushed further into software and services, a shift accelerated by last years acquisition of the data-crunching business Splunk.Product orders rose 29% from a year ago in the fiscal second quarter, which ended Jan. 25. Minus the contribution from Splunk, new orders were up 11%, the company said.In a separate filing, Cisco said that Gary Steele, president of the companys go-to-market division, is leaving. The executive, who previously ran Splunk, is taking a CEO job at an unidentified business.Government SlowdownThough public sector demand isnt at levels that Cisco has previously experienced, the weakness is mainly confined to a slice of that market. Cisco gets the majority of its US government business from the Department of Defense and only about 25% from other agencies. Its those civilian divisions of the government that are ordering less, Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said in an interview.During a conference call, executives fielded questions about proposed tariffs on goods imported from Canada, Mexico and China. Analysts asked whether customers were rushing orders now to avoid the possibility of higher prices later.Cisco downplayed concerns, saying that it learned valuable lessons from the supply crunches of the pandemic. The company now has a more diverse supply chain and uses contract manufacturers with facilities in multiple locations.That will help the company make adjustments to mitigate the impact of tariffs, Herren said. Raising prices will be the last lever it pulls. The companys financial projections include the impact of tariffs on costs, he added.I feel like weve de-risked that, Herren said.Recurring RevenueSales rose 9% to $14 billion in the second quarter, just above the average estimate of $13.9 billion. The revenue expansion in the period was the companys first in a year.Profit climbed to 94 cents a share, minus some items. Wall Street projected 91 cents.Under Robbins, Cisco has been trying to become less reliant on one-time sales of big-ticket equipment. That company has made headway on that front. Products such as security and remote management tools, which are hosted in the cloud, have helped add billions of dollars in recurring revenue.Deferred revenue  a sign of future sales  now totals $27.8 billion, the company said. Thats up 8% from a year ago.The companys board also approved the addition of $15 billion to its stock repurchase program. That brings the budget for buybacks to $17 billion.(Updates with share move in the sixth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musks DOGE Is a Force Americans Cant Afford to IgnoreJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "By Christoph Steitz and Tom KackenhoffFRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp raised its free cash flow outlook on Thursday due to a strong performance at its warship division, which has gained momentum in light of a tighter focus on security after the outbreak of the Ukraine war.Thyssenkrupp said a major submarine order from the German military in December had led to an advance payment of 1 billion euros ($1.04 billion) during the first quarter, in what it says is a \"changed security policy environment\" for defence firms.The news highlights the strength of Thyssenkrupp's marine business, TKMS, which makes submarines, frigates, and sensor and mine-hunting technology, ahead of the planned spin-off of a minority stake either this year or next.Germany approved the purchase of four submarines manufactured by Thyssenkrupp in December in a deal worth 4.7 billion euros, highlighting the division's appeal as governments ramp up defense spending due to the Ukraine war.Analysts at Barclays, highlighting TKMS's order backlog of more than 16 billion euros, said the timing of the spin-off made sense \"and should assuage some concerns that ongoing peace talks around Ukraine may dampen valuation\".Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday. Trump ordered top U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.As a result of the advance payment, Thyssenkrupp now expects free cash flow before M&A - a key indicator for investors on the group's ability to earn money - of between 0 and 300 million euros in 2025, having previously forecast a negative range of 200 million to 400 million euros.Shares in the company, which is active in materials trading, steel and automotive parts, rose as much as 11% to their highest level in nearly nine months.Citing a \"persistently very challenging market environment\", Thyssenkrupp also cut its sales outlook for the year, and now expects revenue to be flat at best and possibly down as much as 3%. It had previously expected a rise of as much as 3%.First-quarter adjusted operating profit more than doubled to 191 million euros, mainly boosted by the group's steel division, which paid less for raw materials and energy.Order intake rose by more than half to 12.48 billion euros, boosted by the German submarine order.Finance Chief Jens Schulte said that even though Thyssenkrupp had received significant interest from strategic players regarding TKMS, the group was not running a dual track process and was solely focused on the spin-off.($1 = 0.9602 euros)(Reporting by Christoph Steitz and Tom Kaeckenhoff; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Rachel More, Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Jan Harvey)"

Among metropolitan areas where its opening new locations, the branch share was 5.7% in Houston as of June 30, and 5.3% in Atlanta, compared with 13.1% in its home base of Pittsburgh.The bank has added 14 new branches since the beginning of 2024 as part of its plan to open more than 200 locations and invest $1.5 billion in branches. It added nearly 600 locations with the acquisition of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SAs US business for $11.5 billion in 2021.The next area PNC will focus on is Salt Lake City, one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, Chief Financial Officer Robert Reilly said Tuesday at a UBS Group AG conference.Were going to do in Salt Lake City what weve done for the better part of the last 15 years, he said.PNC is now established enough in its new geographic regions to grow at a pace exceeding expansion in its legacy markets, according to Demchak. Even with the momentum, PNCs deposit growth, by an absolute amount rather than a percentage, is still slower than at far-larger competitors such as JPMorgan & Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp., he said.Weve been very public for a long time about the need for scale and our pursuit of scale both organically, and if the opportunity arises in the right form, through inorganic acquisitions, Demchak said.In terms of mergers and acquisitions, regional banks with about $150 billion to $250 billion of assets appear to be more interested in buying or growing on their own  and if such banks are unwilling to sell, thered be no way to move the needle on M&A, Demchak said. People dont feel an immediate impetus  my view  to want to do something, he said.One reason for that is that banks predict tailwinds to boost earnings organically. They see paths to unlock loan growth with lower interest rates and President Donald Trumps plans to juice the economy. At the same time, the need to invest is also growing in a broad range of matters, from cyber security and tackling fraud to marketing and broadening services. The lack of scale for smaller institutions is an inherent constraint, Demchak said, considering how much  and how quickly  big institutions can invest.If smaller regional banks were to consolidate among themselves, there is an opinion in the marketplace that five years from now theres another PNC, Demchak said. But, in that time frame, giant banks would be able to increase their market share as well, he said.People who dont realize that they need to be ultimately part of a very large organization are going to struggle, Demchak said.PNC last month announced the departure of Michael Lyons, who was appointed the companys president less than a year ago. The move surprised investors who saw Lyons as the eventual successor to Demchak, 63, when he ultimately retires.Demchak, whos been with PNC for more than 23 years, doesnt see an urgent need to fill the vacancy, and the company has no shortage of talent who are familiar to the board, he said. Hell retake supervision of the primary operating lines, and regional presidents will once again report to him.We take succession seriously and weve gone through an exercise, and well go through it again, Demchak said. But theres no big race or rush, and well do just fine.(Updates with CFOs comments in fourth, fifth paragraphs.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Fast Food Could Be MAHAs Next TargetTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of DeclineThe Game Changer: How Ely Callaway Remade GolfTrump Promised to Run the Economy Hotter.

        "content": "Despite a hotter-than-expected inflation report this morning, Chinese tech stocks shook off the bad news and marched higher. The beaten-down sector continues to advance since the emergence of China's DeepSeek artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot.Shares of the large search and e-commerce company Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) had risen 4.4% as of 11:34 a.m. ET today. Meanwhile, shares of the digital finance company Futu Holdings (NASDAQ: FUTU) had surged 8.4%, and shares of the large tech and videogame company Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY) were up 3.5%.After January's inflation data came in above estimates, most major market indexes sold off as investors further doubted whether the Federal Reserve would be able to cut interest rates more this year with inflation still well above the Fed's preferred 2% target.The emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for AI language models to be built more efficiently has some investors taking another look at Chinese tech stocks, which have performed well as of late. The Hang Seng Index has rocketed nearly 16% over the last month despite continued struggles in China's economy from deflationary pressure and an ailing property sector.\"China has established a stronger presence in AI-powered applications,\" JPMorgan Chase strategists wrote in a report on Tuesday. \"The combination of increasing AI adoption and relatively low valuations positions Chinese tech for potential outperformance.\"Alibaba rose today on media reports that the consumer tech giant Apple has tapped Alibaba to bring more AI features to iPhone users in China. The Information first reported the news. The move will reportedly bring more AI functionality that Chinese users specifically want but also in a way that's compliant with China's strict AI doctrine. The move will also likely make the iPhone more competitive against companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. It's also a testament to Alibaba's AI capabilities because Apple reportedly considered technology and AI models from several other large Chinese tech companies.Futu also surged after analysts at Bank of America reiterated a buy on the stock yesterday and upped their price target from $108 to $129. Bank of America expects the online financial platform to see a significant 30% quarterly increase in new paying clients, while total client assets are projected to rise by 7%. Strong asset inflows and the ability to maintain a gross profit margin of nearly 93% have made analysts bullish.I'm not seeing anything specific about Tencent, but as one of the largest Chinese tech companies specializing in content and video gaming, it's not surprising that it's joining in on the rally. More efficient AI would be a big deal for the company, especially as the U.S. continues to contemplate further chip restrictions.Because of the country's economic struggles, Chinese tech stocks have not enjoyed the same run as U.S. stocks. But many of these tech companies are large, highly innovative, and can grow earnings nicely, all while trading at cheaper valuations. The advantage of cheaper valuations is that they can get going quickly on any good news, which is why many investors are starting to look internationally as U.S. valuations remain elevated.Alibaba, Futu, and Tencent all have strong potential. However, due to economic struggles and the Chinese government's influence, they are likely to be more volatile, so investors need to be aware of this and have the stomach to weather more erratic moves.Before you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alibaba Group wasnt one of them.

        "content": "As the fourth quarter of 2024 wrapped up, freight brokers everywhere were left with a collective headache. With the earnings reports of publicly traded brokerages now out in the open, the numbers told a story that most in the industry had already lived through  and it wasnt pretty. In fact, it was the kind of quarter that had many brokers double-checking their calendars as Q4 historically has been a gangbuster quarter.C.H. Robinson managed to put up better numbers year over year, but sequentially, its performance was down. Uber Freight, for its part, continued to struggle as it extended its more than two-year run of losses on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Meanwhile, Landstar disappointed with its guidance, giving investors pause.RXO, which now has a full handle on the Coyote Logistics integration, was anticipated to keep its streak of decent quarters alive, boosted by the Coyote business. That optimism didnt fully pan out. Investors made their stance clear  RXOs stock promptly dropped 14.92% on the day of the companys Q4 earnings call.The cost of purchased transportation was on the rise, while sales rates were still recovering from their long, painful decline. RXO CEO Drew Wilkerson put it bluntly: We were forecasting some sort of recovery in the freight market ... and if that did not happen, that we would sacrifice a little bit of volume and potentially a little bit of EBITDA as well. And that is what played out.Shippers continued to push for lower rates, while carriers, squeezed by their own rising costs, werent exactly in the mood to negotiate. The result? Margin compression, lower gross profit per load and a whole lot of frustration  the exact scenario that is played out every day and that is a surprise only to Wall Street.The situation raises the ever-looming question of when the freight market will finally turn for the better. There is stability, and hope is growing that the turn has arrived, but is it showing up on the balance sheet?According to Wilkerson, the first signs of rate increases have started to appear, with purchased transportation costs rising year over year for the first time in two and a half years. While that might be a silver lining, its not exactly cause for celebration just yet.At least everything is basically on an upward trend. Its certainly better than this time last year.TRAC Tuesday. This weeks lane goes from Los Angeles to Denver, a lengthy 1,017-mile jaunt over the Rocky Mountains. The Los Angeles market remains one of the largest in the country courtesy of imports at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Spot rates on this lane are the lowest since the end of October. There is little to suggest that rates will increase, as capacity is loosening in Denver but not experiencing much change in LA. Denver has dropped 1.14% in outbound tender rejections week over week for a 6.28% rejection rate. The good thing about Denvers dropping OTRI is that shippers and brokers can expect stronger contract carrier compliance.Whos with whom. We havent made it out completely unscathed in the tariff world yet. President Donald Trump has announced 25% tariffs on all metals imported to the U.S. Both steel and aluminum are subject to these tariffs regardless of the country of origin, meaning the casual $11 billion in steel and $9 billion in aluminum imported from Canada and the $6.5 billion in steel and $686 million in aluminum imported from Mexico will take a massive hit.In his first administration, Trump did have a 25% tariff on steel with exceptions for Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Those exemptions dont appear to be in play this time.This tariff will impact countless manufacturing industries, from cars, buildings and planes all the way to consumer goods such as canned soda.The back and forth in tariffs has spurred talk about starting to renegotiate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) now to refashion free trade among the three countries. The current agreement is set to expire in 2026.There are talks on levying reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. goods. For example, the European Union charges a 10% tariff on U.S.-made cars and the U.S. only charges a 2.5% tariff on cars imported from the EU. Trumps plan is to change that 2.5% import tariff to a 10% tariff to match what is charged on U.S.-manufactured cars.The more you knowBorderlands Mexico: Diverse supply chain can limit tariffs impact, expert saysUpwell secures $6.5M to automate logistics billing practicesAuto hauler Jack Cooper shutting down: CEO letter to workersTMS provider Alvys launches integrated marketplaceWhite House pauses de minimis ban on Chinese e-commerceThe post Check Call: 2024 quarterly earnings miss the mark on Wall Street appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "In timing that couldnt have been more perfect if it had been scripted, auto carrier Proficient Auto Logistics released its fourth quarter earnings Tuesday and then held a conference call with analysts just a day after one of its biggest competitors shut its doors.But that did not mean that management of the newly-created publicly traded company rushed to issue optimistic boasts about how much better Proficients business would be with Jack Cooper exiting the market. Instead, the statements were cautious with the occasional bullish outlook coming through.Even if Proficient (NASDAQ: PAL) management werent popping champagne corks during the call, that doesnt mean investors were required to hold back. Proficient stock, which has been trading only since May, hit a historic high at $11.37 Tuesday before closing at $10.75, a gain of almost 2%.More importantly, the stock overall is up from about $8 per share at the start of Monday, when the news of Jack Coopers closure began to filter through trucking and financial markets.Rick ODell, Proficients CEO, referred to attention and speculation...regarding disruption in the auto hauling landscape, but he did not mention Jack Cooper by name in his opening remarks. As a matter of policy and to adhere to confidential reality around OEM carrier relationships, Proficient will not comment about specific competitors or customers, ODell said.But even with Proficient coming off a quarter that reflected market weakness, ODell did express some optimism. The reported closure of a top five carrier will reduce near-term capacity and likely have widespread impact in the industry, he said. We remain confident that with our service capabilities and the related value proposition, well be able to do more for our OEM customers, and expect to benefit over time through market share gains.Analysts on the call were more direct in their questioning. One analyst referred back to data provided by Proficient during its road show prior to its IPO, when Jack Coopers market share for hauling autos was estimated in the low teens. The road show, according to the analyst, also estimated that Jack Cooper revenue was, north of a billion dollars.When asked if Proficient was comfortable whether the low teens number from the road show was still in place, Amy Rice, the president and chief operating officer of Proficient, said the company, does not have any updated view of the market relative to what was shared at the investor road show, so that would be a reasonable estimate of our understanding at the time.ODell said Proficient doesnt have visibility into Jack Coopers revenue, but that Proficients fleet was not as large as Jack Coopers.Proficient, in its first-ever 10-Q report filed after the second quarter of 2024, said it had utilized 1,130 auto transport vehicles and trailers on a daily basis, a number that includes about  645 company-owned transport vehicles and trailers. It also said at the end of April it had 643 dedicated employees.As for now, the collapse of Jack Cooper has not provided any quick-hit opportunities for Proficient, Rice said. We are seeing what I would describe as episodic spot opportunities and not pervasive spot opportunities in general, she said.ODell ticked off some statistics that reflected the weak market Proficient was up against in the fourth quarter. Revenue from spot market business was 5% of total revenue, versus 14% a year ago. (Year-ago comparisons are against an aggregate of the various auto carriers that were rolled up to create Proficient). The spot market premium over contract pricing was 16% in the fourth quarter. But in the first two quarters of the year, it was more than 100%.Market conditions are not likely to return to the heady levels of the post-COVID period, ODell said. While we believe this current spot market to be unusually weak, we also do not expect to return to the levels of a year ago, he said.Rice was asked what constitutes normal these days. Given that post-COVID hangover is a drag on business, and without mentioning it, a market without Jack Cooper in it, she said, I think were  trying to learn what a normal auto haul market looks like.Rice also provided a multi-point answer in response to a question about how Proficient might go after new market share that will presumably open up with the closing of Jack Cooper.It wont be just a mad dash, she said. Volume that fits our existing network is very attractive to us, and were bidding on all those opportunities that tie into an existing base of driver assets and terminals, Rice said. But Proficient is calculating before it enters a market that it could secure a, concentrated, sustainable level of volume...and then we build around that, both organically and through action.Given that Proficient was created by several acquisitions all at once, with the legacy Proficient business at the head of the pack, ODell was asked about further opportunities in M&A.He said the company has a pipeline of opportunities that will be a nice fit for us, providing synergies and adjacent geographic capacity. ODell said he expects one or two smaller acquisitions to be completed this year.Among some key financial metrics at Proficient:Company delivery volumes fell to 181,961 vehicles from 190,700 in the fourth quarter of 2023; revenue per unit for company deliveries dropped to $179.22 from $193.53; subhaulers delivered 339,515 vehicles compared to 351,417 vehicles; and revenue per unit at the subhaulers fell to $163.49 from $198.59.Proficients adjusted operating ratio was 98.3%, a slight improvement from 98.8% sequentially but well down from 91.7% a year ago.Total operating revenue was down to $95 million from $113.1 from the fourth quarter a year ago. Adjusted operating income plummeted to $1.63 million from $9.35 million.

        "content": "The higher-for-longer narrative returned with a vengeance Wednesday as new inflation data came in hotter than expected, and the rate-sensitive bond market proxy iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) dropped 1.7% to start the days trading.The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) released Wednesday morning revealed a 0.5% increase for January, coming in higher than the consensus forecast 0.3%, bringing the annual rate to 3%. Treasury yields climbed on the news, with the 10-year yield reaching 4.64%, indicating concerns over potential prolonged higher interest rates. Concurrently, this weeks announcement of new steel tariffs, on top of last weeks broader tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods, has heightened inflationary concerns. Economists warn that these tariffs could exacerbate inflation by increasing consumer prices on imported goods. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston estimates that new tariffs could add as much as 0.8 percentage points to core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices.Following yesterdays CPI, the CME FedWatch Tool, which tracks Fed Funds Futures to gauge investor expectations, now forecasts just one rate cut in 2025.TLTs price was off its morning lows in afternoon trading but remained negative.Other than the CME FedWatch Tool, a good gauge of market sentiment around inflation is ETF fund flows, which reveals where assets are flowing. Year-to-date, investors have poured nearly $4 billion into the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV), according to data from etf.coms Pulse Tool. This compares to $841 million in flows for TLT.Other top ultra-short-term bond ETFs, the JPMorgan Ultra-Short Income ETF (JPST) and the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) had inflows of more than $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively.The key takeaway from this data is that investors are betting more on higher-for-longer rates than they are on rate cuts, as ultra-short-term bonds pay higher yields with very little interest rate risk; whereas long-term bond ETFs like TLT are much more rate sensitive, meaning prices will fall much more when yields are rising on inflation concernsPermalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "S&P 500 ETF giant Vanguard just slashed fees on 87 of its funds  the largest fee cut in its 50-year history. And that means $350 million in potential savings for investors is up for grabs just this year.Starting this month, Vanguard lowered the annual expense ratios on nearly 170 share classes including some mutual funds and ETFs. And given that fees have a huge influence on long-term returns, these cuts stand to save investors roughly a billion dollars in just the next three years. \"The impact to existing shareholders is larger than before as there is more money invested in these ETFs than before,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of research at TMX Vetta Fi.Vanguard has now lowered its annual expenses on its funds more than 2,000 times, said Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji in a statement.\"(Vanguard Founder Jack) Bogle had a great phrase, 'You get what you don't pay for,' \" Ramji said. But how can ETF investors take advantage of these new fee cuts?When looking to put fresh cash to work, you'll definitely want to check out the Vanguard ETFs first. Vanguard took down fees on some of its most popular funds.Take $143 billion-in-assets FTSE Developed Market ETF (VEA) as an example. The fee on the fund is now 0.03%, cut in half from the previous fee of 0.06%. This makes an already inexpensive way to invest in key companies in developed nations even cheaper.Invest $100,000 in the fund and you'll only pay $30 as a fee in the first year, down from $60. And it's also a savings from rival ETFs. The $125 billion-in-assets iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA) charges 0.07% annually. That will cost you $70 in the first year on a $100,000 investment.If you already own the competing and higher-priced ETF, your next move is more complicated.First, check if you have an unrealized gain or loss on the costlier ETF. If you have a loss on the position, selling and switching to the lower cost Vanguard fund might make sense. You can use losses on positions you've held for more than a year after you sell to offset realized gains on positions held more than a year. Up to $3,000 of unused losses can also reduce your taxable income each year. Just know you must wait more than 30 days after selling until buying the cheaper ETF if they're equivalent.The decision is tougher if you're sitting on a paper gain on the costlier ETF. You must calculate how much money you'll save on fees. It's then a judgment call if that savings warrants triggering a taxable event on selling. \"If (you) own a competing ETF than the Vanguard products, (you) should decide if the fee savings is enough to warrant selling and having to pay capital gains if in a taxable account,\" Rosenbluth said.Saving money on ETF fees is great. But it's not the only consideration. Some costlier ETFs might be worthwhile if they work better in your portfolio, Rosenbluth says.Vanguard's VEA, for instance, owns Canadian and South Korean stocks that are not found in iShares' IEFA, he says. \"So the performances of IEFA and VEA will be different due to the exposure more than fee savings,\" Rosenbluth said. \"Do you want to have Canada in your developed international equity ETF or not?\""

On Monday, retail investors only purchased a net $34 million in Nvidia's stock based on Vanda's research.Retail investors have also begun \"dumping\" positions in the 2X Bull Nvidia ETF.Yet, Nvidia shares have started to come back up  they are up 5% in February compared to a slight decline for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). The stock is up 13% from its February 3 closing lows.Shares are still down 2.5% year to date.\"By process of elimination, if retails stepping aside, the smart money crowd must be behind the latest recovery [in Nvidia]. However, institutional option flows in the name have yet to rebound strongly, which is something that would give us greater confidence around this view,\" Vanda Research said.\"Still, we believe we can take the above as a vote of confidence by parts of the institutional world in the stock and the sector now that analysts have had time to better digest the potential ramifications of DeepSeeks launch. The verdict from these latest developments? DeepSeek doesnt appear to threaten AIs growth trajectory.\"The Nvidia bulls have been dealing with negative sentiment as of late, somewhat a rarity for one of the most popular stocks in the world.Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis said in a recent note there are three reasons for the weakness: 1) DeepSeek lowering AI demand in aggregate, 2) DeepSeek shifting AI compute cycles away from Nvidia GPUs and to ASICs [custom chips], and 3) Blackwell chip delays.China-based DeepSeek surprised markets in late January after unveiling RI, its AI model that gives a ChatGPT-esque performance at a cheaper price tag. RI cost a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Fears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia chips.Conventional wisdom all of last year was that training amazing models was going to be possible for only a handful of companies, Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below). What DeepSeek has done over the past few weeks is shatter that belief by saying they can train a model for $6 million.This embedded content is not available in your region.The Street has moved to defend Nvidia heading into earnings on Feb. 26, underscoring the view of the smart money rotating into the name.\"Nvidia remains the platform of choice for hyperscalers customers,\" Lipacis explained. \"The robustness of its software ecosystem and breadth of its development community put it 5 to 10 years ahead of anything else in the market. AMD and Amazon AWS ecosystems are a distant #2 and #3.\"Bank of America's Vivek Arya reiterated the chipmaker as his top pick for 2025 earlier this month.Arya has a $190 price target, which assumes about 45% upside from current trading levels. It's one of the highest price targets on Nvidia on the Street.\"The [earnings] call could mark the trough in investor sentiment as: 1) we expect Nvidia to reassure on Blackwell execution, 2) Signal confidence around fiscal year 2026/calendar year 2025 with 60%+ year over year growth in data center sales (still leaves headroom vs. Taiwan Semiconductor's call for AI to grow 100%+ year over year in calendar year 2025 end), and 3) create excitement ahead of flagship GTC Conf. (Mar 17) where focus shifts to solid pipeline (GB300, Rubin), and physical AI (robotics),\" Arya wrote in a note to clients.Watch: why Amazon's stock has a few surprising catalystsSo where are retail investors gravitating to if they are exiting Nvidia? Another classic tech momentum name in Palantir (PLTR).The stock is attracting record retail investor demand, $339 million in the trailing week, says Vanda Research. Interestingly, this is happening despite \"relentless insider selling\" which is usually a bearish indicator.Yahoo Finance data shows there has been almost 77 million shares sold by Palantir insiders in the past six months.\"For now, retails demand has been able to overcome this negative flow dynamic, but should retail disengage even just temporarily, and insiders continue trimming their allocations, that could spell trouble for the stock,\" Vanda Research notes.Palantir's stock is up a sizzling 55% year to date.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hertz Global Holdings Inc. said it finished selling off 30,000 electric vehicles, many of which were Tesla Inc. models, as the rental giant moves on from an ill-advised bet on plug-in cars that customers didnt want and were expensive to maintain.The headlong push into EVs contributed to a loss of $2.9 billion in 2024, Hertz said Thursday in a statement that detailed fourth-quarter earnings. The company lost $1.18 a share on an adjusted basis in the quarter, worse than the 73-cent deficit expected by analysts, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Hertz shares pared an early drop of as much as 14%, falling 11% to $3.79 as of 9:40 a.m. in New York.Since taking over in April of last year, Chief Executive Officer Gil West has sought to get rid of the battery-powered models and start with a fresh fleet of lower-maintenance cars, positioning the business for more profitable growth. His plan is to match Hertzs fleet more closely with consumer preferences in the rental market, and move forward with operational improvements that it expects to complete by the end of 2025.The company showed improvement in depreciation costs, which fell 16% to $422 a vehicle per month, but that is still high compared with historical levels of less than $300. Hertz said its changing over vehicles in its fleet to bring depreciation costs in line with more normal levels.Hertz improved its utilization rate slightly to 79%. It has targeted 80% or better in the past.(Updates from third paragraph with opening shares.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com2025 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.s iPhones will use Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.s AI technology, the Chinese firms chairman said, affirming reports the e-commerce pioneer had scored a coveted role in helping power the iPhone in the worlds top mobile arena.Joseph Tsais comments came after his companys shares rose to a 2022 high in Hong Kong following a report about the partnership between the two leading tech firms. The stock, which had risen as much as 9.2% on Thursday, pared much of its gains after Tsais comments.A local partner could help revive iPhone sales in China, which have suffered as rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co. move ahead with AI-enabled smartphones. Apple has yet to provide its full suite of AI features in China because of regulations that require it to partner with a locally accredited company. Tsai expects that to be the case for the long term, but didnt specify if Alibaba would be the exclusive AI provider for Apple.For Alibaba, securing Apples endorsement marks a win in the highly competitive domestic AI market. On Thursday, Baidu Inc. announced it was making its flagship AI chatbot free, making its own foray to grab a larger slice of the market.Apple has been very selective. They talked to a number of companies in China, and in the end they choose to do business with us, Tsai told Jeffrey Katzenberg during an interview at the World Government Summit in Dubai. They want to use our AI to power their phones.The iPhone maker has yet to officially unveil a long-term partner for its AI offerings in the country, after signing a landmark deal with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones internationally.China is Apples most important market after the US, the biggest market for smartphones, computing and artificial intelligence. But it reported an 11% decline in revenue from China over the holiday quarter, in part because its struggling to fend off Huawei and other rivals. Representatives for the company didnt respond to requests for comment.Alibabas win comes at a pivotal moment for Chinese AI and the company in particular, which gained more than $80 billion of market value in 2025 following a turbulent few years.It marks a surprise reversal of fortunes for a once-dominant internet leader that fell out of favor among investors during Beijings clampdown on tech behemoths and a post-Covid consumption slump. Behind the rally is optimism about Alibabas efforts to develop its own AI services and platform, which gained traction after AI startup DeepSeek unveiled technologies that caused a rout on Wall Street.Alibabas financial results scheduled next Thursday are expected to offer investors an opportunity to learn about the companys progress on its AI models.The emergence of DeepSeek has sparked a new AI-related catalyst for Chinese tech stocks, said Andy Wong, investment and ESG director for Asia Pacific at Solomons Group. Within this space, we see Alibaba as having more tangible and well-established earnings growth prospects in the medium term.Tsai, one of Alibaba co-founder Jack Mas earliest lieutenants, paid tribute to his former boss in Dubai. He spent much of his time talking up Ma as a visionary leader, recounting the early days of their founding story.We need an old pair of hands, Tsai said onstage.--With assistance from Charlotte Yang, Claire Che and Mayumi Negishi.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com2025 Bloomberg L.P."

(GS) has expanded its cryptocurrency ETF strategy with direct holdings in spot bitcoin and Ethereum funds and options positions, underscoring its growing embrace of digital asset-focused investments.Goldman increased its total crypto ETF holdings to $2.05 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, up from the $744 million it held in the third quarter, according to the banks latest 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The banks bitcoin ETF holdings reached nearly $1.6 billion, with its largest position in BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at $1.2 billion.The investment banks new options strategy includes $527 million in put positions and $157 million in call options on IBIT, according to the filing. An additional $84 million put position was established in the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).The filing reflects the investment banking giant's reversal of its prior skepticism about crypto. As recently as last year, the chief investment officer of the bank's Wealth Management division told The Wall Street Journal that the bank did not \"think it is an investment class.\"Goldman's options strategy also suggests that the firm is looking to address crypto's volatility by providing downside protection if crypto markets falter without relinquishing the potential for gains.Goldman also dramatically increased its Ethereum ETF exposure from $25 million in the third quarter to $476.5 million in the fourth quarter, according to the SEC filing. This was split between multiple funds, including around $235 million in both the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and $6.2 million in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH).While building these direct positions, Goldman closed out several smaller ETF holdings from the previous quarter, including positions in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), the filing shows.The data reveals Goldman maintains a $3.6 million position in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), down from the $71.8 million in the previous quarter, according to the SEC documents.With 44 ETFs traded on the US markets, Goldman Sachs ETFs have total assets under management of $36.3 billion, according to etf.com data.

        "content": "Wall Street appears to like CVS (CVS) CEO David Joyner's conservative approach to the company's 2025 financial outlook, rewarding the stock with a nearly 15% bump by market close Wednesday. Joyner also used the opportunity to defend his pharmacy benefit manager unit, which, along with others in the business, has been under fire.The company reported a beat on earnings, with $372.8 billion in full-year 2024 revenues and $97.7 billion in fourth quarter earnings  more than Wall Street's expected $96.8 billion. But for 2025, CVS didn't provide full-year revenue guidance. It did, however, estimate adjusted earnings per share at $5.75 to $6.Joyner just completed his second full quarter at the helm of the $80 billion market cap healthcare giant and ended the full year 2024 by beating Wall Street estimates, despite several headwinds pressuring the company throughout the year, resulting in weaker earnings throughout the first nine months.Joyner told Yahoo Finance he chose to be conservative in order to regain confidence from the Street after the company's health insurance business slowed amid higher-than-expected utilization by seniors last year  a problem all Medicare Advantage players struggled with.\"We did not create a lot of confidence in our ability to predict both the margins or the operating income, and, for that matter, even some of the revenues. So I have been cautious and prudent, and also guiding what I believe we're going to be able to hit. So that's the most important thing from an investment standpoint,\" Joyner said.Wall Street agreed, even though it did not get revenue guidance for full-year 2025 from the company.\"We reiterate our positive view on CVS post-4Q as the company introduced guidance that was ahead of buyside expectations and displays a degree of conservatism from new CEO David Joyner,\" JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.Joyner has started off the year strong but acknowledged that the problems from last year have not disappeared with the start of a new year. Despite a new administration under President Donald Trump, the company is still facing pressure for its pharmacy benefit manager and the role it plays in the US healthcare system.Congress is eager to curb what it deems to be middlemen who are driving health costs higher by keeping savings meant to help reduce costs for patients and setting reimbursements of prescription drugs that squeeze smaller pharmacies. Prior to the departure of his predecessor, Karen Lynch, in October last year, Joyner oversaw CVS's PBM business, Caremark.During the earnings call Wednesday, Joyner defended the role of PBMs in the healthcare system, as he had done in his previous role.\"No one has demonstrated more success than the PBMs that are driving down drug prices,\" Joyner said.Still, the company has started to pivot away from the traditional system of negotiating drug prices and keeping a portion of rebates, instead adopting a similar strategy to Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs, which focuses on a flat rate plus a small markup fee for prescriptions.Joyner said the company believes that combining the new PBM strategy with its healthcare services is going to create a more efficient system.\"This will be a bold statement, but I believe we changed the market. We are driving changes and rationalizing the pricing formulas in this marketplace. So this is not a one-off. This is truly where I believe the marketplace is going,\" he told Yahoo Finance.Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Edwards Lifesciences (EW) stock surged Wednesday  and retook both its key moving averages  after beating fourth-quarter forecasts for its heart-valve replacements.The company is known for its transcatheter aortic heart-valve replacements, or TAVR. This is a means of replacing a faulty heart valve without resorting to open-heart surgery. During the fourth quarter, TAVR procedures generated $1.04 billion in sales, growing 6% year over year, or 5% in constant currency. That beat forecasts for $1.01 billion, according to FactSet.TAVR is used in patients with high, moderate or low risk of complications from surgery. The company is working to expand its use to patients who don't have symptoms of their disease, William Blair analyst Margaret Kaczor Andrew said in a client note.\"While we acknowledge there is more to prove on TAVR growth accelerating toward the high end of 2025 guidance beyond the first quarter, cath lab workflow inefficiencies should be transient and do not take away from the long-term growth opportunities, particularly with asymptomatic indication expansion in the near term and moderate risk over the next two years,\" she said.In morning trades, Edwards Lifesciences stock climbed more than 5% higher to 74.90. Shares are narrowly above their 200-day line and have solidly retaken their 50-day moving average, according to MarketSurge.Across all products, Edwards earned an adjusted 59 cents per share on $1.39 billion in sales. On a strict, as-reported basis, sales rose more than 9%. Both metrics topped forecasts for 55 cents and $1.36 billion, respectively.The biggest beat came from the mitral and tricuspid therapies business, where sales topped forecasts by $10 million, William Blair's Andrew said. These products replace other parts of the heart that can become diseased. Sales came in at $105 million, ahead of the FactSet-polled analysts' call for $94 million.\"The continued strength in TMTT is encouraging for the company's longer-term share position and market growth, with data and new product catalysts on the horizon,\" she said.Andrew kept her outperform rating on Edwards Lifesciences stock.The surgical segment generated $244 million, up 6%  or 5% excluding exchange rates  and narrowly topped the Street's call for $243 million.For the year, the company guided to earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share and 8% to 10% sales growth, excluding the impact of exchange rates. Analysts forecast earnings of $2.44 per share and $5.84 billion in sales.Follow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD."

        "content": "Gilead stock surged above a buy zone Wednesday after the company obliterated fourth-quarter forecasts and issued an upbeat profit outlook for 2025.During the three months ended Dec. 31, Gilead Sciences (GILD) earned an adjusted $1.90 per share on $7.57 billion in total revenue. Earnings jumped about 10.5% and easily beat forecasts for $1.74 a share. Sales rose 6% and topped projections for $7.15 billion, according to FactSet.The beat largely came from Biktarvy, an HIV treatment and Gilead's single biggest moneymaker. The drug brought in $3.8 billion in sales, growing 21% to beat the forecast for $3.47 billion.Next up, Wall Street is closely watching lenacapavir, a potential HIV prevention drug that Gilead could launch in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, the U.S. pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, market grew 16%. This bodes well for the lenacapavir launch, Needham analyst Joseph Stringer said in a report. Gilead's Descovy owns about 40% of the PrEP market.Gilead stock broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 98.90 on Feb. 3. Shares have since slipped below their entry, but not far enough to trigger a sell rule. In morning action, Gilead stock jumped 8.9% to 104.68, topping its buy zone.The only drawback in Gilead's report was Veklury. Sales of the Covid treatment plummeted 53% to $337 million due to lower hospitalizations from Covid, particularly in the U.S. Sales lagged calls for $386 million. Excluding Veklury, total revenue climbed 8%.In addition to strong Biktarvy sales, Gilead reported $616 million in sales of Descovy. Sales of the HIV drug grew 21% and handily beat expectations for $566 million.Revenue from liver disease treatments rose 4%, while revenue from Gilead's cell therapies for cancer treatment edged 5% higher to $488 million. The latter topped forecasts for $476 million. Trodelvy, another cancer drug, brought in $355 million, growing 19% and beating calls for $324 million.Gilead also issued upbeat guidance for 2025. The company expects to earn $7.70 to $8.10 per share on $28.2 billion to $28.6 billion in product sales. The midpoints of the outlook beat Gilead stock analysts' forecasts for $7.61 and $28.35 billion, respectively.Follow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD."

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent of the internet and its mainstream proliferation began changing the business world forever. Though this transformation didn't occur overnight, investors have been waiting quite some time for the next game-changing innovation to come along and bolster the long-term growth prospects of corporate America. After an extensive wait, artificial intelligence (AI) appears to have answered the call.Software and systems are being empowered by AI to make decisions, reason, and evolve, all without the aid of human intervention. With use cases in most industries around the globe, it's perhaps no surprise that the analysts at PwC are forecasting a $15.7 trillion benefit to the global economy from AI by 2030.No public company has taken the bull by the horns more during the early stages of the AI revolution than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) have quickly become the standard for high-compute enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models and running generative AI solutions.But with lofty growth expectations already baked into Nvidia's nearly $3.2 trillion market cap, there are three very specific reasons to believe Nvidia stock is poised to underwhelm following the release of its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter operating results after the closing bell on Feb. 26.To give credit where credit is due, no chip company is particularly close to matching the computing speed of Nvidia's successor Blackwell chip, or even unseating the Hopper GPU at this point.However, the company has also benefited immensely from AI-GPU scarcity. Overwhelming demand for Nvidia's hardware, coupled with limited supply, has helped it book orders well in advance, as well as charge a premium price for its AI-GPUs. Whereas Advanced Micro Devices was netting in the neighborhood of $10,000 to $15,000 for its Instinct MI300X AI-accelerating chips in early 2024, Nvidia was commanding up to $40,000 for its Hopper chip. The result was a gross margin that peaked at 78.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.The concern for Nvidia on and after Feb. 26 is that computing speed isn't everything in the AI space. It's dominated because it's been able to supply the in-demand hardware businesses are asking for. But as AI-GPU scarcity wanes, so will the company's pricing power and its supercharged gross margin.While most investors have focused on direct competitors, such as AMD, the bigger threat is the possibility of losing out on valuable data-center real estate from its top customers by net sales. Most members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are internally developing AI chips of their own. Even though these GPUs are unlikely to surpass the computing potential of Nvidia's Hopper and/or Blackwell chips, they're substantially cheaper and not backlogged. This is a recipe for future orders of Nvidia's hardware from America's most-influential businesses to disappoint.We've already seen Nvidia's gross margin retrace by 380 basis points from its all-time high of 78.4% over the previous two quarters. Don't be surprised if growing internal and external competition, along with waning AI-GPU scarcity, weighs on Nvidia's gross margin and its stock.If there's one thing Wall Street tends to reward, regardless of valuation, it's predictability. Unfortunately, various uncertainties regarding tariffs and export limitations may lead to Nvidia's outlook containing more unknowns than usual.While on the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump was forthcoming about his willingness to use tariffs if elected to promote American interests. The idea behind tariffs is that imposing them on select imports can help domestic manufacturers be more competitive on price. Last week, Trump instituted a 10% tariff on select goods from China.However, a December-released analysis from Liberty Street Economics, which publishes research for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, found that the stock of public companies exposed to Trump's China tariffs in 2018 and 2019 performed notably worse on the days tariffs were announced than companies that had no exposure. These underperforming businesses also, on average, saw their profits, employment, sales, and labor productivity decline from 2019 to 2021.While Nvidia doesn't import products from China, the world's No. 2 economy is one of its largest hardware purchasers. Strained trade relations between the U.S. and China could jeopardize billions of dollars in quarterly sales for Nvidia.To make matters worse, the Biden administration restricted the export of Nvidia's high-powered AI chips to China for three consecutive years (2022 through 2024). Although President Trump and former President Joe Biden don't see eye-to-eye on much, protecting U.S. AI interests is one of those rare shared points. Trump or his administration are unlikely to loosen the regulations surrounding AI-GPU exports to China.These limitations are likely to be reflected in Nvidia's outlook and may result in cautious commentary from its management team.The third very specific reason Nvidia stock can underwhelm after reporting its fiscal 2025 operating results on Feb. 26 is historic precedent. History has a flawless track record when it comes to next-big-thing innovations, and that's bad news for the face of the artificial intelligence movement.One of the more prevalent concerns for Nvidia is that every game-changing technological innovation for three decades, including the internet, has navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event. Bubbles form because investors have a terrible habit of overestimating how quickly a new technology will be adopted and/or gain mainstream utility. Although there are plenty of use cases, on paper, for AI, most businesses lack well-defined blueprints for optimizing the technology and meaningfully improving their sales and profits from it.If there's a silver lining for Nvidia, it's the company's well-established business segments that pre-date the AI revolution. If the proverbial AI bubble were to burst, Nvidia stock would be partially buoyed by GPU demand for gaming and cryptocurrency mining, as well as demand for its virtualization software.The other historic battle Nvidia will be fighting is against its pricey valuation. In June-July 2024, Nvidia stock surpassed a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 40, which has historically been a level that's signaled a top for other market-leading businesses of next-big-thing innovations. Even though Nvidia has backed off its P/S ratio high of last summer, its stock remains pricey -- especially given the laundry list of challenges described above.Even though every Wall Street analyst expects Nvidia stock to rally in 2025, the table appears to be set for it to underperform.Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Chinese start-up DeepSeek rocked the artificial intelligence (AI) market when it announced one particular accomplishment. The company said it trained its model in two months for less than $6 million. This is compared to the billions of dollars big tech companies are pouring into their AI programs. Immediately, investors worried this would prompt the tech giants to rein in spending and follow in the footsteps of DeepSeek -- and that would weigh on the revenue of many AI companies, such as chip powerhouse Nvidia.But a closer look at the situation paints a brighter picture. Tech companies aren't likely to change their spending strategy overnight, and experts have even said that DeepSeek probably spent more on the project than it originally announced. Consultant SemiAnalysis says the figure looks more like $500 million, and that's just for the chips to power the training.But whether DeepSeek's news is game changing or not, certain AI stocks still remain excellent long-term buys and aren't likely to be hurt by the company's progress. Let's check out these two AI players to buy now.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is benefiting from AI across its two businesses: e-commerce and cloud computing. In e-commerce, it uses AI to streamline operations, for example, by identifying the best delivery routes for packages. In cloud computing, it develops and sells a variety of AI products and services.In fact, the cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), already has reached a $115 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to the company's push into AI. AWS has gone all in on AI, offering customers everything from the basics, like chips, to a fully managed service that offers them popular large language models (LLMs) tailored to their needs. On top of this, AWS also develops AI applications, such as Amazon Q, an AI assistant for software development.Customers can come to Amazon for premium chips, such as those sold by Nvidia, but the company also has developed its own line of chips for the cost-conscious customer. Known as Trainium, they can be 30% to 40% more economical for computing in the cloud than other chip options, Amazon says.And since AWS is the world's leading cloud player, it already has a solid customer base. These are customers that may find it very convenient to opt for AWS, a service they know well, for AI projects.Today, Amazon trades for 36 times forward earnings estimates, down from about 44 times just a few weeks ago, offering you a fantastic entry point for this top long-term stock.You may know Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) best as a social media giant as it owns Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. But the company also has become a major player in the world of AI. It's trained its own LLM, known as Llama, and is working toward several big AI goals. And to potentially reach these AI goals, the company can't rely on a small AI budget.Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has been vocal for quite some time about the company's AI ambitions and the need for aggressive spending to achieve them. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, he said Meta would invest as much as $65 billion in infrastructure this year and expand its AI teams too. Meta also said that by the end of the year, the company would have more than 1.3 million graphics processing units (GPUs) on board.All of this should help Meta as it marches toward goals such as the development of an AI assistant for all of its users. The company already offers Meta AI, the most used assistant globally. How does this translate into revenue? Meta generates sales through advertisers that pay to reach users on Meta's apps. Meta assistants could increase their time spent on Meta, and that means advertisers will have even more reason to spend here to contact users. And Meta's AI leadership could lead to other products, services, and revenue opportunities down the road.All of this makes Meta look particularly cheap today, trading at 28 times forward earnings estimates, especially for investors who aim to hold on to the shares as this long-term story develops.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then youll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If youre worried youve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before its too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, youd have $336,677!*Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, youd have $43,109!*Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, youd have $546,804!*Right now, were issuing Double Down alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.Learn more *Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "By Arasu Kannagi Basil(Reuters) -Carlyle Group's distributable fourth-quarter earnings missed market expectations on Tuesday, eclipsing a strong growth in the alternative asset manager's capital market business and sending its shares down 6.1%.The profit miss was largely due to lower proceeds from asset sales, resulting in a 24.1% slide in earnings at its private equity business.The asset manager's profit available to shareholders stood at $384 million, or 92 cents per share, 4 cents short of analysts' expectations, according to LSEG estimates.Its realized performance revenue, mostly driven by asset sales from its private equity arm, fell 4.7% to $245.7 million.Carlyle expects declines in its private equity business to be significantly less in 2025 and growth to resume based on some capital raise in its next U.S. buyout fund, which is slated to launch later this year.The company achieved the financial goals laid out at the start of the last year. Under CEO Harvey Schwartz, Carlyle has prioritized margin growth and investment performance by rejigging leadership and realigning its compensation model.Credit, Carlyle's biggest business by assets, saw distributable earnings jump 20.6%, helping soften the blow in the quarter.While the management continues to improve the platform, based on investor conversations, the pace of gains is likely well below expectations, TD Cowen analyst Bill Katz said.Carlyle's fee-related earnings jumped 13% to a quarterly record of $287.4 million, while assets under management rose 4% to $441 billion.Inflows stood at $14.2 billion in the quarter, driven by its credit business. Carlyle retained $84 billion of unspent capital and deployed $17.6 billion in investments.It anticipates FRE to increase 6% this year, while inflows are expected to be similar to 2024 levels.The reactivation of a cycle of private equity realizations being recycled by investors back into the buyout funds would be key to get the stock moving higher, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said.CAPITAL MARKETS SHINEIn a bright spot, Carlyle's transaction and portfolio advisory fees more than doubled to $80.6 million in the fourth quarter, exceeding Street expectations of $55.3 million.Capital markets has been a major focus area for Carlyle since Schwartz took the mantle in early 2023. For 2024, the business had a record year.Rival KKR last week reported strong growth in its capital markets business.Carlyle's corporate private equity funds and real estate funds rose 1%, while global credit funds gained 3%.In terms of exits, Carlyle in October took portfolio companies StandardAero and Rigaku public in the U.S. and Japan, respectively.The asset manager had in December agreed to sell Italian component maker Forgital to U.S. alternative investment firm Stonepeak in a deal valued at more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.55 billion).($1 = 0.9691 euros)(Reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Pooja Desai)"

        "content": "Shares of Spire Global (SPIR) have fallen $9.89, or 50%, to $9.96 in morning trading after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing earlier that Kpler Holding has failed to consummate the closing of an agreed upon deal. In the filing, the company stated: As previously disclosed, on November 13, 2024, Spire Global, Inc. entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Kpler Holding SA, a Belgian corporation, pursuant to which the company agreed to sell its maritime business to the buyer and enter into certain ancillary agreements. The maritime business to be sold pursuant to the transactions does not include any part of the companys satellite network or operations. The purchase price to be paid by buyer to the company at the closing of the transactions is a cash payment based upon an enterprise value of $233.5M, subject to customary adjustments. The offer also includes a twelve-month transition service and data provision agreement for $7.5M. The purchase agreement provides that the closing of the transactions is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions set forth in the purchase agreement. The company disclosed in November 2024 that it anticipated closing the transactions during the first quarter of 2025. The company believes all conditions to closing contained in the purchase agreement have been satisfied or could be satisfied. Notwithstanding the companys notice to buyer to that effect, buyer has failed to consummate the closing. Buyer has cited various reasons for declining to close, which the company has rejected. There is currently no governmental order in effect prohibiting closing and, in the purchase agreement, buyer agreed to use best efforts, and to take any and all actions necessary, to eliminate each and every impediment that is asserted by relevant government entities so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions promptly. The company believes that buyers failure to close is not consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, which do not give buyer the option to delay closing once all closing conditions have been met. As a result of the foregoing, on February 10, 2025, the company filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against buyer seeking a grant of specific performance ordering buyer to satisfy its obligations under the Purchase Agreement and consummate the closing in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement. In the complaint, the company also requests a declaratory judgment declaring that buyer has breached its obligations under the purchase agreement and is not excused from performing its obligations under the purchase agreement, including proceeding with the closing. There is no assurance as to what action the Delaware Court of Chancery will take with respect to the proceeding initiated by the company and there is no assurance as to whether or not the transactions will be consummated on the terms contemplated or at all. Whether or not the transactions are consummated as required, the company reserves all of its rights under the purchase agreement and in law and equity, including the right to seek damages and other remedies from buyer. The amount of any damages which may be sought or obtained from buyer cannot be determined at this time.Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  Your Smart PortfolioPublished first on TheFly  the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

        "source": "Reuters",
        "content": "By Anton BridgeTOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's SoftBank Group booked a surprise $2.4 billion quarterly loss on Wednesday, hit by a decline in the value of e-commerce platform Coupang and other tech companies held by its Vision Fund investment arm.The result is likely to raise more questions about how founder Masayoshi Son aims to fund one of the tech investment giant's most ambitious undertakings yet - a series of huge bets on artificial intelligence.These reportedly involve tens of billions of dollars to be invested in Sam Altman's Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the Stargate project - to build AI infrastructure in the United States - and Cristal, a joint venture with OpenAI to develop AI services in Japan for corporate customers.While Son's deep-pocketed pledges mark a return to the aggressive SoftBank of old, so did Wednesday's loss. SoftBank rocked the technology investment world by taking big stakes in startups through its Vision Funds. While some of those have paid off, others, like WeWork, have flamed out.SoftBank CFO Yoshimitsu Goto said that investment activity had slowed in the third quarter but would likely pick up in 2025 as the Stargate project develops.Our goal to raise net asset value hasnt changed. One way to climb this mountain is to invest in OpenAI, others are through Stargate and Cristal. Well keep looking for new trailheads.SoftBank reported a net loss of 369.2 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in the October-December quarter, hit by unrealised valuation losses at South Korea's Coupang, Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global and AutoStore Holdings.The third-quarter result compares to an LSEG consensus estimate of a net profit of 234 billion yen ($1.5 billion) drawn from four analysts and a profit of 950 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.EYEING CORE AI INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENTSoftBank's last investment spree ended in 2022, when rising interest rates prompted a precipitous drop in valuations for high-growth startups, forcing SoftBank into defence mode to stem losses.The Vision Fund 2 portfolio was hit particularly hard and is yet to recover. It has booked a cumulative loss of $22.2 billion since its inception in 2019.SoftBank is now hoping to establish itself at the core of AI infrastructure development, even as valuations for AI-related companies such as Nvidia are sky high.Sources have told Reuters that SoftBank has committed to invest $15 billion in Stargate, the joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank which U.S. President Donald Trump said would invest up to $500 billion to build AI data centre capacity in the country.Goto said on Wednesday that SoftBank's investment would only come in the form of equity.The enterprise will primarily be funded through project finance, which is often used in energy infrastructure projects and will bring in debt financing from other investors such as banks and insurance companies, Goto added.SoftBank's cash and cash equivalents dropped to 4.7 trillion yen as of the end of December from 6.2 trillion yen in March which was the end of the previous financial year.Total returns for SoftBank, comprising share gains and dividends, are up more than 11% over the 12 months, outperforming a 4% return for the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.($1 = 153.8500 yen)(Reporting by Anton Bridge; Editing by David Dolan, Edwina Gibbs and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Shares of electric vehicle (EV) stocks were on the rise Thursday, including Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and EV-related power chipmakers Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) and Indie Semiconductor (NASDAQ: INDI). These stocks were up 5.7%, 14.9%, and 5.1%, respectively, as of 1:30 p.m. ET.There was no company-specific news for these three stocks today. That means investors were likely reacting to positive incremental news for EVs generally. Plus, given how beaten down these stocks were, even \"less bad\" news was probably enough to generate short covering.While each of these stocks is experiencing a big move today, all three have been beaten down severely. Indie Semiconductor is down 78% from all-time highs, but Rivian and Wolfspeed are down a stunning 93% and 96%, respectively. Meanwhile, short interest in each of these stocks is relatively high: Rivian's short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding is 14%, and Wolfspeed's and Indie's short interest are both around 25%.All three companies are currently losing money as they invest in an attempt to capture their share of the future EV industry. Rivian is attempting to scale its manufacturing plants and best rivals in terms of technology, which is expensive. Wolfspeed has invested huge sums of money in silicon carbide chip-production plants in the U.S., but thus far has little revenue to show for it. And Indie is a small-cap stock that produces both sensors and power chips for autonomy and electrification.However, with last year's severe slowdown in electric vehicle sales, all three are seeing muted demand for their products after making big investments. The demand slowdown has been especially painful since each stock has to invest capital up front but isn't receiving as much revenue from those investments yet.It was unclear exactly why beaten-down EV-exposed stocks moved today. The rise could be related to a media story published today that the State Department was planning to buy 400 armored electric vehicles to transport diplomats and other high-level officials. The story is likely getting attention because it was initially reported the contract would go to the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Cybertruck. Given CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump Administration, the story highlighted a potential big conflict of interest.A department official later clarified that in December, the State Department issued a request for information from private companies about building an armored EV and that only one company had responded, likely Tesla. The official then went on to say the next step would be an official solicitation to manufacturers to bid on the project. However, the solicitation is on hold for now.Still, the news may have spurred buying or short covering in EV stocks, given that investors have thought the current administration was less EV-friendly. Seeing the State Department's interest in purchasing armored EVs would reverse that narrative.While the story may be considered a positive today, investors should know that this initial request happened in December under the previous administration. Currently, the project is on hold, and a department official said there are no current plans to issue the bidding request. Additionally, in a post on X, Elon Musk denied the $400 million award:Therefore, investors shouldn't take today's EV stock action as a sign of a recovery. It's likely just a dead cat bounce. A real recovery in these stocks will come only from a broader resumption of EV demand growth after a big slowdown last year. That would happen either due to technological innovation that lowers EV prices and spurs demand and/or lower inflation and interest rates.Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rivian Automotive wasnt one of them.

The transportation division generated $3.33bn in revenue, up 4.8% from 2023 but down 3.5% from Q4 2023.Grupo Mexico's copper production reached 1.086 million tonnes (mt) in 2024, aligning with the company's forecast, mainly due to a 10.7% production rise in southern Peru and a 4.3% rise at Minera Mexico. Production recovered by 5.5% from 2023.Molybdenum production reached 6,994 tonnes (t), reflecting a 2.6% decline compared with the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily attributed to reduced production at Caridad and Toquepala, although these losses were partially balanced by gains at Cuajone and Buenavista.Zinc production for Q4 2024 amounted to 43,148t, an increase of 154.9% from Q4 2023, driven by the commencement of operations at Buenavista Zinc and enhanced output at Santa Barbara.Silver production in Q4 2024 totalled 2.76 million ounces, representing a 25.2% decrease from Q4 2023, while gold production stood at 8,003 ounces, 4.2% higher than the same period in 2023.The mining divisions capital investment programme for this decade exceeds $15bn, focusing on key projects in Mexico such as El Pilar in Sonora and El Arco in Baja California.In Peru, the company is advancing projects including Tia Maria in Arequipa, Los Chancas in Apurimac and Michiquillay in Cajamarca.\"Grupo Mexico reports 12.6% revenue growth in 2024, led by mining division\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.

The stock is up 23% year to date and is the best-performing component of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" The stock is up 5% in February alone, besting the relatively flat performance for the S&P 500 (^GSPC).Nowak believes there is a lot to like fundamentally about Meta.The first is the raw numbers, powered by several years of improving the platform and better advertising industry dynamics.Earnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 50% from a year ago.Its app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) saw sales improve by about $7 billion year over year. The business added close to $7 billion in operating profits too.In the last seven days, Yahoo Finance data shows 23 analysts have pushed up their earnings per share estimates on Meta for 2025. A total of 20 analysts have hiked their EPS projections for 2026 in the past seven days.54 out of 63 analysts that cover Meta rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy.\"They're analyzing more instances of when you scroll up and down the feed, where do you stop, where do you stall, where do you scroll faster? And they're using more data points to essentially improve the relevancy of all the content that their users see by daypart,\" Nowak explained.\"And then they're able to also take that data and use it on the advertising side and determine are you more likely to click on ads in the morning when you're catching up from the night's news? Or is it, are you more likely to click on ads in the evening when you're scrolling through your daily catch up or your sports.\"The next catalyst for Meta shares could be how the issues surrounding TikTok play out.TikTok is working again after briefly going dark in the US to comply with the divest-or-ban law that kicked in on Jan. 19. A final decision on the platform's fate by President Trump has not been made, though he has leaned toward pushing for part US ownership.\"I still do think there is some uncertainty about what happens with TikTok  if TikTok is acquired, who ends up acquiring it, it does matter for Meta. If TikTok is instead shut down, that also really does matter for Meta. That is sort of all related to President Trump as well,\" Nowak added.Three times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "The big attraction right now with Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE: IIPR) is likely to be its huge 10%+ dividend yield. That's a really high yield for a real estate investment trust (REIT). There are both opportunities and risks to examine here when considering whether or not this highly focused landlord is a millionaire maker in the making.Innovative Industrial Properties is an industrial REIT, which means it owns physical properties with industrial purposes and leases those assets out to tenants. That's not unusual. What makes Innovative stand out is that it is specifically focused on owning marijuana-related properties, especially grow houses. These are highly specialized industrial assets that require material additional investment.This is where things get interesting, because the marijuana industry's legal status is a bit murky. It is legal in some states, but not all. And it isn't legal at the federal level. Banks and other lenders have been reluctant to lend marijuana related companies money. Innovative has stepped into the void, effectively helping to finance its tenants' expansion efforts. This is a big deal.Given the heavy investment needed to make a grow house, Innovative not only buys the building but often also pays for the upgrades. These costs get rolled into the lease deal, meaning that Innovative can generally charge very high rental rates. Given that its tenants have few other financing options, they are willing to pay higher rents. However, there's a risk here, since a tenant that gets in financial trouble could risk leaving Innovative with assets that it can't easily release at the same terms.Right now, Wall Street is highly worried about Innovative Industrial's business model. It has been dealing relatively well with tenant issues for a while now. But at the end of 2024 the REIT's largest tenant, PharmaCann, defaulted on the leases for 11 properties. That was a big blow to Innovative's investment story.The two companies have since come to an agreement over the issue, in which two of the properties will be transitioned to new tenants (assuming new tenants can be found) and PharmaCann will pay reduced rent for the remaining properties. PharmaCann will also issue Innovative an interest-bearing note, presumably to make up for at least a portion of the rent lost in this transaction.This is a reasonable outcome, but it highlights the risks inherent in Innovative's highly focused approach. That said, the marijuana sector is expected to continue expanding and to be quite large. Innovative believes it will be larger than the beer and spirits industries, each taken individually, by 2028. Being one of the largest players in this niche, Innovative could be a huge beneficiary of that growth.Assuming the REIT doesn't continue to face tenant challenges as the still-young industry matures, the stock could rise back toward previous highs (most likely slowly and over time). And then there's the huge yield that investors can collect. It could compound quickly if reinvested in the stock. And don't forget that 10% is roughly the return investors expect from the broader market over time. Investors are getting that with Innovative's dividend alone right now.If things go well, Innovative could indeed be a millionaire-maker stock. But that assumes that things will go well. Tenant issues have been an ongoing problem and are likely the biggest risk to the stock's long-term investment thesis. So far, management has managed the issue reasonably well, but there's no guarantee that will continue. If things get worse the dividend could be at risk, which would upend the investment thesis.Conservative dividend investors should probably sit on the sidelines with Innovative Industrial Properties. There are material risks that are, very clearly, impacting the REIT's business. That said, the business model has largely held up to the stress so far, helped along by a very conservatively managed balance sheet.More aggressive investors may want to consider adding Innovative to their portfolios. Just go in understanding that a dividend cut is a possibility if tenant problems continue. That seems like it is priced into the stock, however, so it may not derail the upside potential in the share price as Innovative looks to grow along with the highly specific industry it serves.Before you buy stock in Innovative Industrial Properties, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Innovative Industrial Properties wasnt one of them.

        "content": "CVS Health (CVS) topped fourth-quarter earnings estimates, but still saw profit slide 38% from a year ago. However, the pharmacy chain, which has a new CEO, offered a 2025 outlook that envisions a return to growth. Though the earnings outlook is below what analysts had penciled in, it was strong enough to make CVS stock the No. 1 performing S&P 500 name in Wednesday's early action, running neck and neck with Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\"We have continued to see growth in key areas of our business, including the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, while we address the industrywide challenges that have impacted our Health Benefits segment,\" CEO David Joyner said in a statement.Results: Adjusted earnings per share tumbled 44% to $1.19, but easily beat forecasts of 92 cents. Revenue rose 4.2% to $97.71 billion.CVS said it completed a three-year store closure plan, but will further optimize its footprint in 2025.Outlook: CVS Health expects adjusted EPS of $5.75 to $6 a share, up from $5.42 in 2024. The midpoint is just above the FactSet consensus $5.86. However, anther estimate aggregator had a $5.97 consensus.CVS said that the low end of its EPS outlook would represent about 10% growth vs. 2024, after adjusting for an 18-cent gain related to reserves held for benefit payments.Revenue should be \"at least\" $385.9 billion vs. $372.8 billion in 2024 and a FactSet consensus of $385.9 billion.In December, it seemed like CVS was near the center of a political storm, as Congress nearly advanced legislation to rein in pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) including CVS Caremark. Bipartisan legislation was introduced to go much further, requiring PBMs divest their pharmacies.For now, though, aggressive PBM reform may be on the back burner, while other areas of health care like Medicaid are on the hot seat for potential spending cuts.Republicans are generally seen as supportive of Medicare Advantage, a focus of the CVS health benefits business. One of the outgoing Biden administration's last moves was to propose a bigger-than-expected rate increase for Medicare Advantage in 2026.CVS stock leapt 10% to 60.47 in early Wednesday stock market action. The move will carry CVS past its 200-day moving average, with a break above its 10-month trend line.Be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column after each trading day to get the latest on the prevailing stock market trend and what it means for your trading decisions.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Join IBD Live Each Morning For Stock Tips Before The OpenThese Are The Best 5 Stocks To Buy And Watch NowIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis TodayHow To Make Money In Stocks In 3 Simple Steps"

        "content": "The January Barometer is one of the most well-known stock market indicators, based on the idea that the markets performance in January sets the tone for the rest of the year. Dating back to 1950, when the S&P 500 Index (SPX) gained in January  like this years 2.7% rise  it averaged a 12% return for the rest of the year, with positive returns 87% of the time. Conversely, when January was negative, the index averaged just a 2% gain for the rest of the year, with 60% of returns positive.In this article, Ill further explore this concept by finding individual stocks that exhibit their own January Barometer. Perhaps this will give us additional insight into what to expect from those stocks for the rest of 2025.Using a decades worth of data, I identified SPX stocks with January returns that predicted the rest of the year most often. That is, if January was positive, so was the rest of the year. If January was negative, then the rest of the year was also negative.The stocks listed below were positive in January and have a history of that return correctly predicting direction. The first two tickers on the table  D. R. Horton (DHI) and Cooper (COO)  had returns for rest of the year follow the same direction as their January return 90% of the time (as is indicated in the January Barometer column). Based on this table, mega caps Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also have a high probability of moving higher for the rest of the year.The next table shows stocks likely to go down according to their own January Barometer. Notice the first ticker on the table, Digital Realty Trust (DLR), which is the only stock in the SPX with a January return that has correctly predicted the rest of the year in each of the past 10 years. With a 7.6% loss in January, this does not mean its 100% certain to go lower rest of the year, but its an interesting stat.Microsoft (MSFT) is a mega cap that made the list, but in the last 10 years, its been lower in January three times, and after two it was higher the rest of the year. This means investors should take this information with grain of salt. Campbells (CPB) might be more interesting. Over the past 10 years, its been negative in January four times, and every time its been down for the rest of the year, averaging a return of about -14%.Based on the January Barometer, the SPX has an increased probability of moving higher over the next 11 months. Hopefully, weve gained insight into the direction of some individual stocks for the rest of the year, given their individual January Barometer performance."

The health care benefits segment, which includes its various insurance products, was down slightly, with ongoing Medicare and Medicaid headwinds, which have also impacted its peers, dragging the company's revenue.Still its retail pharmaceutical business, at a time when the business model is struggling, increased, as well as the health care services segment.CVS reported its medical loss ratio (MLR), which provides insight into how much the insurance arm is spending compared to the premium dollars it takes in, at 92.5%. That's a slight improvement from the record high it reported in October for third quarter earnings, at 95.2%. The Affordable Care Act mandated insurers spend between 80%-85% of premium dollars, and Wall Street views the lower end of that scale as most favorable.In addition, even with a new White House administration in place, the company remains exposed to attempts to curb the role of pharmacy benefits managers, which CVS boasts being the largest.CVS is also coming off a tumultuous year that ended with a new CEO, David Joyner, taking the helm towards the end of the year. In addition to the government insurance business headwinds, CVS also battled an activist investor and weighed breaking up the company. The company's profits continued to trend down, 38% year over year, with a reported $8.5 billion for the full year in 2024 compared to $13.7 billion the prior year.Shares fell 40% last year, and the company previously withheld 2025 guidance. CVS announced its guidance for 2025 Wednesday, estimating adjusted earnings per share of between $5.75 and $6  but it didn't provide annual revenue guidance.\"We have continued to see growth in key areas of our business, including the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, while we address the industry-wide challenges that have impacted our Health Care Benefits segment,\" Joyner said in a statement Wednesday.Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Hims & Hers Health (HIMS), a high volatility stock with high IBD Ratings, is a telehealth company offering a range of health and wellness products and services.The company faces a backlash over a provocative Super Bowl commercial that criticized the makers of weight-loss drugs and the U.S. health care system.Sens. Richard Durbin and Roger Marshall have requested the FDA investigate Hims & Hers Health for potentially misleading patients. They say the ad failed to include comprehensive safety and side effect information.High volatility means high option premiums. That can be great for investors that are looking to buy the stock.One way to take ownership of a stock for less than the current price is via a cash-secured put option trade.Let's take a look at how a cash secured put might look on Hims & Hers Health.A cash-secured put involves writing an at-the-money or out-of-the-money put option and simultaneously setting aside enough cash to buy the stock.The goal is to either have the put expire worthless and keep the premium, or to be assigned and acquire the stock below the current price.Anyone selling puts must understand they may be assigned 100 shares at the strike price.Let's assume we're happy to buy 100 shares of Hims & Hers at a price of 40 between now and March 21.Selling a March 21, 40-strike put would generate around $410 in premium. The put seller would have the obligation to purchase 100 shares at 40 if called upon to do so by the put buyer.The breakeven price for the trade can be calculated by taking the strike price less the premium received. In this case, that's 35.90. That's 17.62% below Tuesday's closing price.If the stock stays above 40 at expiry, the put expires worthless. That leaves the trader with a very high 11.42% return on capital at risk. That works out to around 109% on an annualized basis. But remember, that risk and return go hand in hand.The main risk with the trade is similar to outright stock ownership: If the stock falls sharply, the trade will suffer a loss. However, the premium received will partially offset the loss.The maximum loss on the trade would occur if Hims & Hers fell to $0. That would see the trade lose $3,950. But most traders would cut their losses before then.Cash-secured puts are a fantastic way to generate a nice return on stocks the trader is happy to own.If the put does get assigned, the investor takes ownership with a reduced cost base. The trader can potentially begin selling covered calls to generate additional income from the position.According to the IBD Stock Checkup, Hims & Hers is ranked No. 1 in its industry group. It has a Composite Rating of 98, an EPS Rating of 90 and a Relative Strength Rating of 99.Hims & Hers Health is due to report earnings on Feb. 24 after the market close.It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment.This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

        "content": "Looks like Nvidia's (NVDA) run as the top S&P 500 stock is taking a breather. Make room for a new champ.Shares of security software firm Palantir Technologies (PLTR) are up 49.6% this year  making them easily the top stock this year so far in the S&P 500, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSurge. Palantir is leaving Nvidia in the dust, as shares of the AI superpower are down 0.7% this year.That's a huge difference. Had you invested $10,000 at the start of the year on Palantir, you'd have $14,958 now or a gain of $4,958. That same $10,000 plunked down on Nvidia would be worth just $9,930 for a loss of $70.\"There are some transformational tech stocks that come along every decade and change the landscape,\" said Dan Ives of Wedbush. \"Palantir is one of them in our view and proved it for all the tech world to see.\"Seeing such a massive run so far in Palantir is out of the ordinary for the market this year. The average S&P 500 stock is only up 2.9%.Year to date, less than two-thirds of the stocks in the S&P 500 are higher at all. And of those, just 16 are up 20% or more. Palantir is the only S&P 500 stock to be up more than 40%.Much of the enthusiasm for Palantir's stock happened on Feb. 3, when the company reported December-quarter results. The company wound up making 14 cents a share, topping estimates by more than 27%. Shares are racing higher, driving the RS Rating to a perfect 99.But it's not just speculation. Analysts think the company's earnings will rise 30% in 2025 and another 25% in 2026. But don't rush into this one. Palantir stock is extended. It needs to form a base to be actionable, according to MarketSurge.But don't think Palantir can claim the title for the best S&P 500 stock just yet. Nvidia isn't even close to catching up, but there's still some competition.Baltimore-based utility Constellation Energy (CEG) is runner-up so far, with its shares up 38.6% for the year. Shares are benefiting from increased demand for electricity to power AI models. The stock's 96 RS Rating is only slightly below Palantir's. And analysts think the company's profit will jump 10% in 2025 following an 89% rise in 2024.And then there's Super Micro Computer (SMCI). Shares are racing higher 29.6% this year after falling in 2024 on accounting worries. Super Micro carries an RS Rating of 75 and EPS Rating of a perfect 99. But it also late Tuesday cut its revenue forecast for the year.So while Palantir is untouchable now, it still has competition for the top spot.In 2025 so farFollow Matt Krantz on X (Twitter) @mattkrantz"

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) stock dipped back below an entry point after the company gave lower-than-expected sales guidance with its fourth-quarter results last week. Still, shares of the tech behemoth are near highs amid a five-month rally.Amazon's overall gains in the past year have been powered by investor optimism about the company's expansive e-commerce and cloud-computing operations. But as Amazon's Q4 results highlighted, there are still ongoing investor debates for Amazon stock.Analysts are scrutinizing the position of the Amazon Web Services' cloud business in the battle for enterprise artificial intelligence spending against Microsoft (MSFT). Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce dominance is facing challenges from Walmart (WMT) and China-based upstarts such as Temu and Shein. Investors are also debating whether the AI-powered rally for big tech stocks can keep up the pace into a third year, particularly after DeepSeek shook up the market.So is Amazon stock a buy? Here's what to know about recent stock action and news for the tech giant:Amazon stock traded a fraction lower on the stock market Tuesday, hovering near 232.60 in recent action.Shares are trading just below a former 233 flat base buy point on its weekly chart, according to MarketSurge. Shares rallied  past the entry on Jan. 24.The stock is also finding support at its 21-day moving average with Tuesday's action.After a sluggish start to January, Amazon stock is up about 6% on the year as of Tuesday.Meanwhile, Amazon's Relative Strength Rating sits at 88 out a best-possible 99. That means Amazon has outperformed 88% of stocks in the IBD database over the past 12 months. IBD recommends focusing on stocks with at least an 80 RS Rating.The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows Amazon stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.Investors also will want to check out IBD's Big Picture column for the current market direction before considering any buy points. Here is a guide to understanding IBD's rating system.Amazon stock fell following Q4 results on Feb. 6, despite the tech giant's results for the December period beating estimates.Earnings increased 86% year-over-year to $1.86 per share, beating expectations. Sales grew a better-than-expected 10% to $187.8 billion.But the company's outlook for sales and operating income for the current quarter came in below expectations. The company said a strong dollar provided a headwind to its outlook.Amazon Web Services sales, meanwhile, advanced 19% to $28.79 billion for Q4, just below views.Chief Executive Andy Jassy said AI represents the biggest \"technology shift and opportunity in business since the Internet.\" Amazon will spend at least $100 billion this year on capital expenditures, with a focus of cloud AI capacity. But Jassy also cautioned that constraints on cloud capacity will make revenue growth \"lumpy,\" echoing comments by cloud rivals Microsoft and Google.Amazon stock fell by 3% following the report.The 30-year-old Amazon is among the world's most valuable companies. It is a leader in e-commerce spending and in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services business. It is also quickly growing its advertising business into a challenger to Google (GOOGL) and Meta (META). Amazon joined the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average last year.Wall Street analysts still see room to run for Amazon. Of the 72 stock analysts following Amazon, 94% have a buy rating, according to FactSet.And despite the lower-than-expected Q1 outlook, Amazon's average target price from analysts increased following the report. Analysts hold an average target price of 267.12, according to FactSet, implying roughly 15% upside from Amazon's price as of Tuesday.Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak reiterated a buy rating and maintained a 260 price target in a client note following Amazon's earnings results.\"The shares have pulled back 4% in the aftermarket on the guidance and the fact that 2025 is likely an investment year, but we expect by (second-half 2025) this heavy capex investment and accelerating AI adoption  which we believe will also accelerate the move to the cloud  should begin to materially re-accelerate cloud revenue.\"You can check for Amazon's current stock price here.

Classmates include Duolingo (DUOL), Samsara (IOT), Dutch Bros (BROS), P10 (PX) and AppLovin (APP), one of the best stocks of 2024. Another is Toast (TOST) stock.Few industries were harder hit during Covid than restaurants. And while Toast  a provider of technology solutions for restaurants  initially sank after going public, it learned to stand the heat and now stands poised to launch a fresh breakout. It also has joined AppLovin and its other IPO classmates on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index.In addition to landing on the IBD Breakout Stocks Index, Toast and Internet of Things leader Samsara have secured placement on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks. Language-learning platform Duolingo and coffee shop chain Dutch Bros also make this screen.On Monday, AppLovin was featured as a member of IBD Leaderboard, a list of stocks to watch curated by IBD market experts.See Who Joins Toast, AppLovin On The IBD Breakout Stocks IndexToast provides a cloud-based platform developed specifically for the restaurant industry. Toast's technology gives restaurants everything they need to run their business across point of sale, payments, operations, digital ordering and delivery, marketing and loyalty, and team management.With a 94 Composite Rating, Toast outpaces 94% of all stocks in terms of the most important stock-picking factors. Fellow leaders in Investor's Business Daily's Credit Card/Payment Processing group include Shift4 Payments (FOUR) and Paymentus (PAY), with both earning the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating. The group ranks No. 32 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.Albeit based on comparisons to prior-year quarters that showed a loss, Toast has delivered two consecutive quarters of triple-digit earnings growth. Analysts expect that to continue when the Boston-based company reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 19. Still based on prior-year quarters that showed a loss, analysts forecast 250% earnings growth to 17 cents per share, followed by a 467% gain to 17 cents a share for the first quarter of 2025.Sales growth has been solid and steady. Although gains have slowed somewhat, revenue growth has ranged from 26% to 53% over the last eight quarters. In the third quarter, Toast generated slightly more than $1.3 billion in sales.Five Reasons To Watch Samsara. A Pending Breakout Is Just One.Since bottoming out in November 2023, shares of Toast began a post-pandemic climb, generally holding or quickly regaining support at the 10-week moving average.The stock gapped up in heavy volume after reporting third-quarter earnings on Nov. 7 before pulling back to begin forming its current base late that same month.Toast is now working on a second-stage cup with handle. The buy point is 41.50. On Jan. 31, the restaurant technology firm initially cleared that entry, but has since floated in and out of buy range.On Tuesday, Toast pulled back as its relative strength line dipped. But the stock came off the day's lows to close 3% shy of the buy point.Meanwhile, fellow Class of 2021 IPOs Samsara, Duolingo and P10 are in or near buy range. Dutch Bros has climbed beyond buy range.The IBD Breakout Opportunities (BOUT) exchange traded fund from Innovator Capital Management tracks the IBD Breakout Stocks Index.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock climbed as much as 12% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the tech company announced a positive update on its plans to avoid being delisted by the Nasdaq and outlined an ambitious new revenue goal for 2026.On Tuesday, the company told investors it now expects to submit delayed filings to the SEC by the Nasdaq's Feb. 25 deadline to avoid delisting.Super Micro said it \"continues to work diligently toward the filing\" of its delayed annual and quarterly reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and \"believes it will make such filings by February 25.\" The company had put off submission of the filings following a scathing report published last year by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research accusing the server maker of accounting violations.A rival to Dell (DELL) that makes computer servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips, Super Micro's CEO Charles Liang said on a call with investors late Tuesday, \"I believe we have potential to reach $40 billion for fiscal year '26.\"After the bell on Tuesday, Super Micro reported preliminary second quarter earnings for its fiscal 2025 that missed Wall Streets estimates. The company said it expects to record a revenue of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, below the $5.95 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.The company cut its revenue guidance for the 2025 fiscal year to a range between $23.5 billion and $25 billion, lower than its prior range of $26 billion to $30 billion.SMCI shares sank as much as 19% after the bell on Tuesday in an initial reaction to the earnings results before reversing direction.Liang added on his call with investors Tuesday evening that the server maker has a \"confidential product under development\" to support that claim. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg had forecast 2026 revenue closer to $30 billion. Super Micro said last week that its server systems for data centers using Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips are now fully available.Super Micro's business update comes after a turbulent year in which the company faced ongoing controversies in the wake of the Hindenburg report. The US Department of Justice reportedly launched a probe into Super Micros accounting practices. The firm's delayed annual and quarterly SEC filings put it at risk of being delisted by the Nasdaq, and its accountant resigned.The Nasdaq recently granted Super Micro an extension to submit the filings by Feb. 25. The company has hired a new accountant, and the server maker said an independent review of its business found no evidence of misconduct.Super Micro stock had been on an upswing ahead of its scheduled business update Feb. 11, but reversed direction Tuesday. Shares fell more than 9% by the end of the trading day Tuesday, ending a week-long rally that saw shares gain nearly 60%.Super Micro confirmed in its update Tuesday that it had \"received subpoenas from the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking certain documents following the publication of allegations in a short seller report which was published in August 2024.\"\"The Company is cooperating with these document requests,\" the company continued.Super Micro added that it's facing \"several securities litigation complaints and derivative suits\" but believes they are \"without merit.\"Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Restaurant Brands (QSR) topped expectations for quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday, helped by strong performance at its brands Burger King and Tim Hortons, sending shares of the company up about 3% in pre-market trading.Burger King, like other fast-food chains such as McDonald's (MCD) and Taco Bell-parent Yum Brands (YUM), has been offering combo options for as little as $5 and $7, which has helped it bring back some traffic in the last six months.Consumers in the United States last year had trimmed their spending on dining out which had become far more expensive than it used to be a few years ago.This hurt sales at Burger King and put a strain on U.S.-listed shares of Restaurant Brands, which fell more than 16% last year.The company's Tim Hortons chain has, however, benefited from several quarters of strong growth, particularly in Canada, where it operates over 5,700 outlets under the banner.Tim Hortons revenue grew to $1.03 billion in the three months ended December 31, compared with $1.02 billion a year ago.The unit accounted for 44.7% of the company's total revenue in the reported period.Like other companies in the restaurant space, the Burger King-parent has also worked to increase efficiency and reduce costs in the kitchen, as well as within the supply chain.The company is in the midst of remodelling Burger King stores in the U.S., which includes upgrading equipment.Restaurant Brands reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.30 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.28 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Peer Yum Brands also handily beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter earnings last week, helped by strong demand at its Tex-Mex chain, Taco Bell, earlier this month.Restaurant Brands, which also owns the Popeyes brand, reported adjusted earnings per share of 81 cents for the fourth quarter, topping estimates of 78 cents.(Reporting by Juveria Tabassum in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)"

        "content": "(Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold announced a new $1 billion share buyback program as higher gold prices helped the company beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday.U.S.-listed shares of the company rose 1.5% in premarket trading as the gold miner also more than doubled its free cash flow in the quarter.Gold prices rose over 27% in 2024, their biggest yearly rise since 2010, driven by safe-haven demand, interest rate cuts and buying from central banks.Higher gold prices have buoyed gold miners' earnings last year as they earned more on mining and selling the yellow metal.Barrick said its average realized gold prices rose to $2,657 per ounce in the fourth quarter from $1,986 per ounce last year.It scrapped its previous share buyback program that was in place from February 14, 2024, having repurchased $498 million under it last year.However, Barrick on Wednesday lowered its gold output forecast for the year to between 3.2 million ounces and 3.5 million ounces, from 3.9 million ounces in 2024, following the temporary closure of its Loulo-Gounkoto mine in Mali.Barrick shuttered the mine in January amid an ongoing dispute with authorities in the West African country over a new mining law that seeks to steeply raise royalty taxes and the state's ownership in mining projects.The closure has also weighed on Barrick's share price performance, the company said.Since Reuters exclusively reported in September that the Malian junta-government arrested four Barrick employees, the company's shares had fallen over 10%, as of Tuesday's close.CEO Mark Bristow said Barrick is still \"open to a constructive engagement\" with the government, adding that a mutually beneficial solution could still be found.The company's 2024's gold output also came in below 2023's 4 million ounces, largely due to a slower-than-expected ramp up at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic.On an adjusted basis, Barrick posted a profit of 46 cents per share for the quarter ended December 31, compared with estimates of 41 cents, according to data compiled by LSEG.All-in sustaining costs (AISC), an industry metric reflecting total expenses, however, rose to $1,451 per ounce in the quarter, from $1,364 per ounce last year.(Reporting by Seher Dareen in Bengaluru and Felix Njini in Cape Town; Editing by Maju Samuel)"

With this  $36 million OXY buy, Buffett's stake in Occidental Petroleum is now 28.3%, or $12.9 billion.Berkshire Hathaway entered 2025 with cash reserves sitting in excess of $300 billion after Buffett decided to sell of a portion of his Apple (AAPL) holdings.

Shares have pulled back from an April 2024 high but are up 4.2% in February. However, OXY has declined 9% from its January high of 53.20. The stock is attempting to reclaim its 50-day moving average with its relative strength line at three-year lows.Buffett's decision to add more OXY comes ahead of Occidental Petroleum's fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 18. Analysts predict quarterly profit slipping more than 9% with sales declining around 3%.Occidental in recent quarters has been focused on cleaning up its balance sheet and reducing debt. At the end of Q3, the Permian Basin oil producer said it repaid $4 billion of debt, achieving about 90% of its short-term debt reduction target. In August, Occidental executives said they hoped to pay off about 85% of its near-term $4.5 billion debt reduction commitment by the end of Q3.Meanwhile, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has continued to support Houston-based Occidental Petroleum. Prior to the Feb. 7 purchase, Buffett most recently bought OXY in December 2024.Along with the 28.3% stake, Berkshire Hathaway also owns $8.5 billion of Occidental preferred stock and has warrants to buy another 83.9 million common shares for $5 billion.In August 2022, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Berkshire Hathaway approval to purchase up to 50% of available OXY stock. However, Buffett told shareholders in early 2023 he has no intention of taking over the company.Occidental Petroleum stock has a 34 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Optimists have had every reason to smile over the last two-plus years. Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite bottomed out in October 2022, the bulls have been in firm control on Wall Street. Recently, all three indexes worked their way to record-closing highs.Though catalysts have been abundant and include Donald Trump's return to the White House, stock-split euphoria, and better-than-expected corporate earnings, the primary wind in Wall Street's sails has been the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).The ceiling associated with AI is astronomically high. Giving software and systems the ability to reason, act, and evolve over time, all without the need for human intervention, is a potential long-term game-changer for most industries around the globe. It's why the analysts at PwC believe artificial intelligence will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.While there have been dozens of direct and ancillary beneficiaries of the AI revolution, no company is the face of this movement more than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).When the curtain closed on 2022, Nvidia was a $360 billion tech stock known best for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in PC gaming and cryptocurrency mining. Less than two years later, it had gained more than $3 trillion in market value and (briefly) became Wall Street's largest publicly traded company.Nvidia's ascension has everything to do with its Hopper (H100) GPU and next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, which are enabling the training of large language models (LLMs) and powering generative AI solutions. Orders for the company's hardware are backlogged, with CEO Jensen Huang referring to demand for Blackwell as \"insane\" back in October.Having a superior product, in terms of computing speed, and having demand for that product overwhelm supply, is an envious position to be in. AI-GPU scarcity has allowed Nvidia to charge a 100% to 300% premium to competing AI chips, which in turn has pushed its gross margin into the stratosphere.Nvidia is having success beyond its AI hardware, as well. The company's CUDA software platform, which is used by developers to build LLMs and maximize the computing potential of their GPUs, is helping to keep clients loyal to its ecosystem of products and services.With enterprise AI spending still in its infancy and no other chipmakers particularly close to matching the computing potential of the Hopper or next-gen Blackwell GPU, Nvidia would appear to be ideally positioned for the future.But if investors pay close attention to what Nvidia's insiders are up to, they might change their tune.One of the best aspects of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that it's more transparent than it's ever been. With a click of a button, investors have instant access to operating results, balance sheets, management commentary, and investor presentations.Additionally, investors can track the purchasing and selling activity of Wall Street insiders, which represent the high-ranking executives and board members of publicly traded companies. Insiders are required to file Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission within two businesses days following a transaction date.On Dec. 3, 2024, Nvidia hit a dubious milestone. This marked exactly four years since the last insider purchased shares of the company on the open market. In this case, it was Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress's two children who were the beneficiaries of respective 100-share purchases, per the Form 4 filing. In the four years and two months that have followed, 161 Form 4s have been filed, all of which were insider sales totaling an aggregate of $3.4 billion.To be fair, not all insider selling activity is necessarily nefarious. A lot of high-ranking executives receive the lion's share of their compensation in the form of vested shares and stock options. Insiders need to execute their options contracts before they expire and might choose to sell shares of their company to cover their federal and/or state tax liability.Then again, 161 dispositions to 0 acquisitions over a span of 50 months is a pretty telling story. If the company's own management team and board of directors don't view their stock as a bargain, why should investors?Companies on the leading edge of a next-big-thing innovation being in a bubble is nothing new. Dating back to the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every game-changing technological innovation has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. With most businesses lacking a clear game plan with their AI investments, there's a good chance we're witnessing history rhyme, once more.Nvidia's valuation is also consistent with previous bubbles. Prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble a quarter of a century ago, Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked at roughly 40 times their trailing-12-month (TTM) sales. Perhaps uncoincidentally, Nvidia topped out around 42 times TTM sales last summer.Even with Nvidia possessing well-defined competitive advantages in AI-accelerated data centers, the persistent selling by insiders and complete lack of buying points to Nvidia stock being richly valued.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December.At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January.\"We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker,\" Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination.Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers.On Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla.Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either  a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies.\"Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape,\" Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing.And last, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired.The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup.Podcast: how Musk delivers on his biggest promises\"There's a bit of a disconnect, in our view, between what's happening fundamentally and what's happening from a sentiment perspective,\" Rusch said.The Oppenheimer analyst is also concerned that even with the sell-off in the stock, Tesla remains overvalued.Yahoo Finance data shows Tesla shares are valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 111 times. The forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22 times. Auto rivals Ford (F) and GM (GM) are valued at PE multiples of 6 times and 4 times, respectively.Rusch thinks Tesla's valuation will be \"a little bit challenged\" in the coming years, unless the company can \"deliver on a number of promises\" it has made to investors such as robotaxis and humanoids.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "By Amina Niasse and Sriparna Roy(Reuters) - CVS Health (CVS) reported a smaller-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday as the pace of medical cost increases slowed at the healthcare conglomerate and revenues jumped in its pharmacy business, sending its shares up more than 9% in premarket trading.The company missed earnings targets for the first three quarters of 2024 as it was among the worst hit by surging costs in the Medicare insurance business for people aged 65 and older or who are disabled. Shares had slumped more than 40% last year.On an adjusted basis, CVS reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.19 per share, down from $2.12 a year earlier, but above analysts' average estimate of 93 cents.The company's healthcare benefits division posted a quarterly loss of $439 million, compared to a profit of $676 million in the prior year.The swing to a loss was driven by increased use of medical services, a change in \"Star\" or quality ratings for its Medicare Advantage plans and an increase in sicker members enrolled in its Medicaid plans for lower income people.CVS recorded a charge of about $1.1 billion in the third quarter in connection with premium deficiency reserve in its Medicare business, which is a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses.The company's medical loss ratio, or percent of premiums spent on patient care, rose to 94.8% in the fourth quarter from 88.5% in the same period a year earlier. It had hit a record-high of 95.2% in the prior quarter.Analysts expected the company to report a loss ratio of 95.46%, according to consensus estimates compiled by brokerage Deutsche Bank.CVS laid out major plans for cost cutting in November and underwent a top management reshuffle as part of new CEO David Joyner's efforts to turn around the company.Revenue in its pharmacy and consumer wellness segment rose 7.5% to $33.51 billion, helped by higher volumes of prescription drugs.The company expects its full-year profit to be between $5.75 and $6.00 per share, compared with estimates of $5.96, according to data compiled by LSEG.(Reporting by Amina Niasse in New York, Sriparna Roy and Sneha S K in Bengaluru)"

        "content": "Biogen (BIIB) beat fourth-quarter earnings and sales expectations Wednesday, but Biogen stock could get hammered on the biotech's light earnings outlook for 2025.For the current year, the biotech company calls for adjusted profit of $15.25 to $16.25. The high end of Biogen's outlook missed projections for $16.33, according to FactSet. The company also calls for sales to decline by a mid single-digit percentage in constant currency. In comparison, analysts call for $9.4 billion in 2025 sales, down 2.8%.Biogen stock ended Tuesday's regular session at the lowest levels since February 2013. Shares are below their 50-day moving average. Biogen has largely traded below that key level of support since last July, MarketSurge shows.Across all products, Biogen's fourth-quarter sales inched 3% ahead to $2.46 billion. That topped expectations for $2.41 billion. Adjusted profit climbed 17% to $3.44 per share, beating forecasts for $3.35 a share.Notably, sales from Biogen's biggest segment, multiple sclerosis treatments, declined 8% to $1.07 billion. Promisingly, Alzheimer's drug Leqembi  developed with Japan's Eisai (ESAIY)  hit $87 million. That crushed projections for $67 million, \"representing good sequential growth,\" the company said in its news release.Skyclarys, a Friedreich's ataxia treatment, brought in $102 million in sales. That matched the third quarter, and missed forecasts by $10 million. Biogen noted U.S. sales took a $71 million hit due to stockpiling and Medicare discount dynamics.Biogen stock remains under pressure with a low IBD Digital Relative Strength Rating of 10. This means the stock ranks in the bottom 10% of all stocks when it comes to 12-month performance. But Chief Executive Christopher Viehbacher was upbeat on the company's outlook, especially where Leqembi is concerned.\"We believe 2024 was an important year on our journey to deliver long-term sustainable growth,\" he said in a written statement. \"We delivered continued revenue growth from our ongoing product launches including Leqembi, where we believe there remains a significant long-term opportunity.\"Follow Allison Gatlin on X/Twitter at @AGatlin_IBD."

        "content": "Steel and aluminum stocks, along with the VanEck Steel ETF (SLX), rose following the announcement of new tariffs on imported metals.This protectionist measure is expected to reduce competition for domestic producers. Major players in the steel industry, like Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor Corp. (NUE), and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-headquartered United States Steel Corp (X), both top holdings in the SLX ETF, climbed on Monday.The tariffs are anticipated to boost domestic steel and aluminum prices, increasing profitability for US producers. Reduced competition may lead to higher market share for domestic companies, driving revenue growth.The long-term impact of these tariffs on the broader economy remains uncertain, as these tariffs carry potential risks. Retaliatory tariffs from other countries could harm US exports and negatively impact the broader economy. Additionally, increased production costs for industries reliant on steel and aluminum could fuel inflationary pressures.US steel and aluminum manufacturers touch multiple industries, including auto manufacturing, construction, infrastructure, and national defense, according to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute.SLX rose 3.4% on Monday.Tariffs on steel and aluminum increase prices for U.S. steel stocks and ETFs like SLX by creating a more favorable pricing environment for domestic producers. Here's how:Reduced Foreign Competition: Tariffs make imported steel and aluminum more expensive, reducing competition from foreign producers. This allows US companies to raise prices without losing market share.Higher Domestic Steel Prices: With fewer cheap imports, domestic steelmakers can charge more for their products, boosting revenue and profit margins.Increased Demand for US Steel: Many US manufacturers switch to domestic suppliers to avoid tariffs, driving higher sales for US steel companies.Improved Earnings & Valuations: Higher steel prices and demand increase profitability, leading to higher stock valuations as investors anticipate stronger financial performance.Government Infrastructure Spending: Tariffs often come alongside policies that support US manufacturing, such as infrastructure bills, which further drive demand for steel and aluminum.In summary, tariffs can act as a protective measure for US steelmakers, allowing them to sell at higher prices and improve their financial health, which in turn supports higher stock prices in the sector. However, the potential risk of retaliatory measures from other countries and inflationary pressures remains.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com. All rights reserved"

Also, the company in December announced a 2-for-1 stock split.With earnings due Thursday, investors may want to be cautious ahead of the report.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Over the past year, a number of semiconductor stocks have witnessed meteoric gains thanks to ongoing euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). The share prices of Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Broadcom have all risen approximately 80% over the last 12 months -- handily outperforming both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.But one name in the chip realm that just can't seem to appeal to investors is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), whose shares have dropped 36% in the last year.Below, I'm going to analyze AMD's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings report. While the results can be a little challenging to navigate, I see a lot of potential in AMD's long-run roadmap. I'll explain how the company is making notable inroads in the AI realm, and make the case for why now looks like a great opportunity to buy the dip in AMD stock.I think the surface-level explanation as to why stocks such as Nvidia or Taiwan Semi consistently climbed higher over the last year is because each company's business results are accelerating across the board. That's generally a good recipe to garner enthusiasm from investors.Conversely, AMD's financial profile has been tougher to gauge. Among its four operating segments, two are growing in spectacular fashion... and two are decelerating at alarming rates. For this reason, AMD's overall growth rates look quite mundane compared to its chip peers.For all of 2024, AMD's revenue increased by 24% while net income rose 42%. It's a respectable picture, but when you consider that the gaming and embedded segments declined by 59% and 13%, respectively, it's hard not to wonder what AMD would look like if all of its major businesses were in a position of strength.While I understand that point of view, I think it's shortsighted. Remember, the semiconductor industry is quite cyclical. For this reason, it's not uncommon for a company such as AMD to witness ebbs and flows across certain operating categories. To me, the real concerns should be over whether or not the company's long-term narrative looks robust or weak.The area that I personally focus on most regarding AMD is its data center business. This is the part of the company that supplied advanced chipware known as graphics processing units (GPUs) to data centers. For most of the last two years, Nvidia has been the primary player in town when it comes to data center GPUs.However, a closer analysis of AMD's financial results suggests the company is making significant headway in its own right. During 2024, AMD's data center business generated $12.6 billion in sales -- rising 94% year over year. Even better? Operating profits in this unit grew almost threefold. To put this into perspective, AMD's data center business only grew by 7% year over year in 2023 and operating profits actually dropped by more than 30%. This is quite a turnaround in just one year.So, what changed? AMD released its MI300X accelerators in December 2023. This product has served as a pivotal shift for AMD, as the company now has a GPU that can compete more directly with those supplied by Nvidia -- and all at a reduced cost.Over the last year, AMD has made inroads with the likes of Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Oracle, supplying each of these companies with MI300 chipware in addition to their existing Nvidia hardware stack. Recent comments made by leadership from Microsoft and Meta heavily imply that investment in AI infrastructure is very much planned to continue, and I see these commitments as a positive force for AMD.Right now, AMD trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 24, which is essentially the same as the average forward P/E of the S&P 500. I see the parity between these multiples as a suggestion that investors view a position in AMD as carrying the same upside as simply dumping your money into an index tracking the S&P 500.In light of the myriad expanding markets underneath the AI umbrella, combined with the importance chips play in powering these applications, it's hard to justify an investment in AMD as being on par with the broader market. When you consider just how quickly the company has scaled its data center business, I become even more bullish on AMD's potential to disrupt players like Nvidia down the road.I see now as a great opportunity to buy the dip, hand over fist, in AMD stock and prepare to hold for the long run.Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasnt one of them.

        "content": "McDonald's (MCD) results missed the mark to end 2024 as the fast food chain faced an underperforming stock, lackluster sales, and an E. coli outbreak.Revenue at the fast food giant for the fourth quarter decreased 0.28% from a year ago to $6.39 billion, missing expectations for $6.45 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 were also lower than Wall Street's estimate of $2.84.Global same-store sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were up 0.4%, compared with an expected decline of 0.91%. But US same-store sales were down 1.4% year over year, as an E. coli outbreak offset momentum in late October. The burger chain alluded to a decline in check growth, offset by slightly higher guests count.CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors that the company is moving with \"urgency\" as it looks to increase guest count, win market share, and reclaim \"leadership in value and affordability.\"Global same-store sales for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31, grew 0.4% compared to an expected decline of 0.91%.International-owned stores saw positive same-store sales growth in the Middle East, which CFO Ian Borden attributed to the lapse of the impact of the Israeli conflict, plus growth in Japan and \"encouraging signs of stabilization\" in China.Many on the Street hope the fourth quarter results are the \"low point in recent history for the brand,\" as Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a note to clients. In 2025, the chain aims to regain foot traffic with its McValue menu platform and new offerings from chicken strips to the return of snack wraps.Here's what McDonald's reported for fourth quarter results, compared to Wall Street estimates, per Bloomberg consensus data:Revenue: $6.39 billion versus $6.45 billionAdjusted earnings per share: $2.80 versus $2.84Global same-store sales growth: +0.4% versus -0.91%US same-store sales growth: -1.4% versus -0.35%International-owned same-store sales growth: -0.1% versus -1.22%International franchised same-store sales growth: +4.1% versus -0.38%Here's what McDonald's reported for the full fiscal 2024 year, compared to Wall Street estimates, per Bloomberg consensus data:Revenue: $25.92 billion versus $25.99 billionAdjusted earnings per share: $11.39 versus $11.74Global same-store sales growth: -0.1% versus -0.39%US same-store sales growth: +0.2% versus +0.44%International-owned same-store sales growth: -0.2% versus -0.50%International franchised same-store sales growth: -0.3% versus -1.39%Kempczinski said January was sluggish across the US restaurant industry.\"It sounds like January was not a good month across the board, mostly driven by really poor weather in every region  snow, extreme cold,\" BTIG analyst Peter Saleh told Yahoo Finance prior to earnings. The conditions make it difficult to assess whether the value menu drove incremental foot traffic.Ahead of the earnings report, TD Cowen's Andrew Charles said he'd be looking for company-operated stores' margins and any impact from the value offerings.Net income fell 1% to $2.02 billion during the quarter and was down 3% for the year to $8.22 billion.Franchise operators had hoped that the McValue platform would lure in customers, offsetting any hit to margins.\"There may be a margin challenge where we are providing food at a great value, but if we can bring more people in, then it will take care of that. That's our goal,\" David Costa, a McDonald's franchise operator who operates 18 locations in Florida with his father, told Yahoo Finance prior to the McValue launch in January.Borden said parts of the platform, such as buy one, add one for $1, led to \"good margins\" and allowed the customers flexibility in building their meal. He added that breakfast continues to be a strong performer and hinted at innovation to come.2025 is expected to be a year of value and affordability for McDonald's. It's looking to win back low-income consumers and lure customers in with menu innovation.\"With good value at the foundation, we will overlay a strong pipeline of creative marketing ideas that will delight our fans and will provide full margin check growth,\" Borden said.That includes building on its chicken portfolio with \"the potential to add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026.\"Analysts say the company's efforts will show up in results for the second half of the year.\"The comparisons get so easy in the second half that even if they fumble through the first half ...[McDonald's is] still going to have [a] positive, constant recovery story in the second half,\" Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, told Yahoo Finance on the phone.Saleh, who has a Neutral rating, said franchisees are worried about the overdependence on promotions.In January, the buy one, get one offering made up a mid-teens percentage of sales, and the $5 Meal Deal accounted for low-double digits. Franchisees also offered in-app promotions, according to Saleh's note to clients.\"When 35% of your business is now on steep discount or free, [it's] hard to really make a lot of money on that,\" Saleh said. \"[It's] going to be tough to wean the consumer off of that and bring them back to kind of more profitable type products.\"Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Super Micro said it expects to record a revenue of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, below the $5.95 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. The company cut its revenue guidance for the 2025 fiscal year to a range between $23.5 billion and $25 billion, lower than its prior range of $26 billion to $30 billion.Super Micro's business update comes after a turbulent year in which the company faced ongoing controversies in the wake of the Hindenburg report. The US Department of Justice reportedly launched a probe into Super Micros accounting practices. The firm's delayed annual and quarterly SEC filings put it at risk of being delisted by the Nasdaq, and its accountant resigned.The Nasdaq recently granted Super Micro an extension to submit the filings by Feb. 25. The company has hired a new accountant, and the server maker said an independent review of its business found no evidence of misconduct.Super Micro stock had been on an upswing ahead of its scheduled business update Feb. 11, but reversed direction Tuesday. Shares fell more than 9% by the end of the trading day Tuesday, ending a week-long rally that saw shares gain nearly 60%.Super Micro confirmed in its update Tuesday that it had \"received subpoenas from the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking certain documents following the publication of allegations in a short seller report which was published in August 2024.\"\"The Company is cooperating with these document requests,\" the company continued.Super Micro added that it's facing \"several securities litigation complaints and derivative suits\" but believes they are \"without merit.\"Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) hovered just below the flat line, after the major gauges closed mixed on Tuesday.Hopes for rate cuts face a key test in Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for January, after Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal Reserve isn't in a rush to change policy amid stubborn inflation and Trump-fueled uncertainty.

We expect the momentum to sustain in the near-term given global investors light positioning.The MSCI China Index has risen about 15% from a January low, outperforming its Asian peers this year. A gauge of Chinese tech shares listed in Hong Kong entered a bull market last week.The growing optimism has spurred a flurry of buy-side action, luring hedge funds and managers like Fidelity International. While China has a long way to go to prove that the AI hype can benefit the broader private sector, the buzz at least helped offset downside pressure coming from trade tensions.Based on the experience during the 4G, 5G and cloud computing eras, it would seem that we are less than halfway through the rally driven by DeepSeek, UBS strategists including James Wang wrote in a note dated Wednesday.Alibaba (BABA) stock saw a leap over 10% on the news that Apple (AAPL) is working with the Chinese e-commerce platform on breaking into artificial intelligence business in China.Bloomberg reports:The stock climbed its most since October after the tech outlet, citing one unidentified source, said Apple and Alibaba have submitted AI features for approval to Chinas cyberspace regulator.

A shipset refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft.Reuters reported last week that Spirit Aero increased fuselage production to 31 a month, up from 21.Spirit expects revenues of $1.66 billion in the quarter ended on Dec. 31, 2024, surpassing analysts' average estimates of $1.61 billion.Spirit Aero expects to report a loss of $413 million, owing in part to high labor and raw material costs as the aerospace supply chain remains strained. It had posted a profit of $291 million a year ago.Spirit Aero also said it is expecting forward losses due to Boeing's widebody 787 program, along with Airbus's A220 and A350.(Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Vijay Kishore and Nick Zieminski)"

        "content": "With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, investors may need to reconsider their position before the selling picks up.\"Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent,\" Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday.The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components  Meta  has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance.Amazon is the only other Magnificent Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year.Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Magnificent Seven).Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons.For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026.Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts.Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion.The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker.\"There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on todays massive investments,\" says Parker.Valuation on Magnificent Seven stocks  despite their sell-off  also remains a concern for Parker.Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Magnificent Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average.Warns Parker, \"The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern.\"Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia?And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors.\"We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7,\" Parker said.\"However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their funds beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years.\"Beta exposure measures a portfolio's sensitivity to market volatility.One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness.Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Magnificent Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found.With the investment thesis on the Magnificent Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

President Donald Trump says he'll announce new tariff hikes on Monday and later in the week.The stock market rally had an up-and-down week amid Trump tariff headlines, huge earnings and economic data. The major indexes ultimately retreated, with Nasdaq falling below key support.In this environment, it's important to step back from daily or intraday swings. Use weekly charts to help put the major indexes and individual stocks in perspective.Tesla (TSLA) sold off last week to 2025 lows, threatening to break decisively below a recent consolidation.Dow Jones futures climbed 0.55% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.55%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8%. That would suggest that the Nasdaq composite will open slightly above the 50-day line.The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.49%.Crude oil climbed more than 1%.Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.President Trump said Sunday that he'll hike tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Monday. He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs later in the week on other countries that impose duties on U.S. goods.Shares of U.S.-based steel and aluminum stocks rallied early Monday.Last week, Trump hiked China tariffs across the board by 10%, while suspending 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 30 days.China reportedly will levy tariffs of up to 15% on U.S. autos and energy, though it doesn't import those in significant numbers. It's also reportedly drawing up a list of more U.S. companies to probe, including Broadcom (AVGO). Beijing last week offered initial targeted retaliatory duties and probes.Trump has also promised tariff hikes on the European Union.Robinhood (HOOD), Shopify (SHOP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Howmet Aerospace (HWM), AppLovin (APP), DoorDash (DASH), HubSpot (HUBS) and Reddit (RDDT) are among the notable earnings reports this week.Investors also will get the January PPI and CPI inflation reports.AppLovin, Shopify, DoorDash, Howmet Aerospace and HubSpot stock are on IBD Leaderboard.

Shopify stock and HubSpot are on the IBD Big Cap 20.Join IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD LiveThe stock market rally tumbled Monday morning on Trump tariff threats, rebounded for most of the week before falling again Friday on hot inflation expectations and renewed Trump tariff chatter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.5% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, tumbling 1.4% on Friday to drop below the 50-day line.The Dow, S&P 500 and even the Nasdaq aren't that far from record highs. But the Nasdaq is below its 50-day line while the S&P 500 is close to that key level.The small-cap Russell 2000 slipped 0.35%, continuing to hit resistance at the 50-day.With the indexes at key levels, it's easy for the market to look bullish or bearish on any given day. Looking at weekly charts can help smooth out the changes.Several leading stocks flashed buy signals in the past week. There were some huge earnings winners, but also some notable losers.The 10-year Treasury yield sank eight basis points to 4.48% after hitting a 2025 low of 4.4% during the week.U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.1% to $71 a barrel last week.Four S&P 500 Stocks Near Buy Points In Tricky MarketAmong growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) rallied 5.3% last week, with some big winners paying off. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) gained 1.7%, with Palo Alto stock and AppLovin notable holdings. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) advanced 0.6%.ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) dipped 0.2% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) climbed 0.45%. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.

The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) climbed 0.7%.Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market StrategyTesla stock tumbled 10.6% for the week to 361.62, hitting a two-month low. Shares are now 26% below their Dec. 18 all-time high of 488.54 buy point. Shares have tumbled since hitting resistance on Jan. 31 at a downward-sloping trendlineIf TSLA stock rebounds from here the pattern would be a double-bottom base with a 439.74 buy point. A rebound above the 50-day line could offer an early entry.But there's a danger that Tesla stock breaks considerably lower.TSLA stock fell slightly early Monday.The relative strength line for Tesla stock is at a three-month low.Tesla sales have tumbled in Europe to start 2025, a sign that CEO Elon Musk's increasingly political statements are hurting the brand there as well as in the U.S. Meanwhile, Musk-fueled optimism about Tesla robotaxis may have waned somewhat.Tesla Rival Breaks Out On Self-Driving BetsThe stock market remains choppy and headline driven. It's one of the most challenging environments for active investors. There's enough strength to lure traders in and enough weakness to shake them out.To be fair, leading stocks have looked better than the major indexes. But there have been some big blowups in recent weeks due to earnings, AI news and more.Investors can make new or add-on buys, but it's definitely a time to be incremental. And there's nothing wrong with standing pat or even reducing exposure if your stocks aren't working or your risk tolerance has been breached.While daily charts are useful to identifying specific buy points, it helps to have a longer-term perspective. Use weekly charts to avoid getting too giddy or glum about the market or individual stocks.Staying engaged and flexible is key. Have your watchlists and exit plans ready. If you've done that homework ahead of time, it's easier to keep your emotions level when the market is topsy-turvy.Shopify, Robinhood, AppLovin, Palo Alto, Reddit, Howmet and other earnings will be important.

        "content": "By Anton BridgeTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group is set to make a quarterly net profit of 234 billion yen ($1.54 billion) on Wednesday as shares in its telecommunications holdings edge up and the post-listing performance of Swiggy is seen boosting the value of its portfolio of unlisted technology startups.Analysts are divided, however, on whether the spate of artificial intelligence-related investments SoftBank has announced in recent weeks will help or hurt the Japanese technology investment conglomerate's bottom line.The profit of 234 billion yen is based on the average of four analyst estimates compiled by LSEG, and compares with a gain of 950 billion yen in the same period last year.SoftBank is expected to bank further investment gains on U.S. telecommunications subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom T-Mobile US, whose shares hit an all time high in late November and rose 7% over the quarter.Also in November, Indian delivery firm Swiggy jumped 17% on its market debut and had risen almost 20% by the end of December.This may signal a recovery in IPO markets, particularly in India, and so trigger a bump in the valuations of SoftBank's several-hundred strong portfolio of unlisted tech firms, analysts say.More uncertain is the future impact of the major artificial intelligence investments announced over the past two months.SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son's pledge in December to invest $100 billion in AI projects in the U.S. over four years could entail selling or monetising portfolio assets or taking on excessive debt, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note.Alongside, last week Son announced a new joint venture with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to offer AI services in Japan for corporate customers and roll out OpenAI products across SoftBank's portfolio companies.While some analysts say this may bring efficiency gains at portfolio companies, others say the $3 billion annual usage fee paid to OpenAI could diminish near-term earnings.($1 = 152.2600 yen)(Reporting by Anton Bridge; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)"

Sea (SEA) is also a stock to watch.The stock market rally ended last week on a sour note, falling Friday amid inflation and Trump tariff fears. The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day line. Ultimately, the market is rangebound.However, a number of leading stocks showed bullish action.With this is in mind, investors should keep an eye on these five stocks as they assess current holdings and work on watchlists. T-Mobile, Bank of America and Royal Caribbean have already reported quarterly figures, while Axon and Sea are weeks away.Investors can also keep tabs on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist, the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks and IBD SwingTrader along with the IBD Sector Leaders list.How To Buy StocksT-Mobile shares jumped 5.7% to 246.24 in last week's stock market action.

Sales jumped 31% to $4.3 billion.

However, investors could also use its recent high of 277.08 as a high handle entry. This comes after Royal Caribbean cleared an early buy point of 250.11.Meanwhile, rival Carnival (CCL) slumped 0.5% on the week and is just below a 27.16 flat base entry.

Meanwhile, booked load factors remain in line with prior years, and at higher rates. Guest spending for onboard and pre-cruise purchases continues to exceed previous years, driven by greater participation levels at higher prices, Royal Caribbean reported.\"Our strong booked position allows us to optimize our yield profile and drive margin expansion and strong financial returns,\" Chief Financial Officer Naftali Holtz said in the earnings release.Royal Caribbean forecasts 2025 adjusted earnings will range from $14.35 to $14.65 per share.

The Fed cut rates three times since September to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 per cent, though it held off easing last month to reassess inflation.Investors had priced in inflation risks in the run-up to Trump's January 20 inauguration, she said, improving the risk-reward profile for bond investors. UBS is optimistic the \"dislocation\" is temporary, and is betting on rate cuts to drive bond prices higher.Louis Wong, a director at Phillip Capital Management in Hong Kong, said the US equity market would continue to rise this year on tax cuts, helping earnings of S&P 500 members to grow by 15 per cent. The advance, however, would be fraught with fluctuations as Trump's agenda fuels volatilities.\"The US stock market has outperformed the Hong Kong market over the past two to three years, so we suggest investors put more US stocks in their portfolios, especially leading tech firms,\" he said. \"It remained unknown whether Trump would levy more tariffs on Chinese goods. This could impact the inflation and the pace of rate cuts.\"The Hang Seng Index has had a shaky start to the year, after rebounding 18 per cent in 2024, as Trump imposed an additional 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports. He had threatened in January to raise it to 100 per cent if China fails to sell half of the short-video platform TikTok to US investors.As a result, Hong Kong stocks are facing greater uncertainties as US tariffs undermine China's economic recovery momentum, Wong added.Additional reporting by Mia CastagnoneThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Finnish telecoms company Nokia on Monday said Pekka Lundmark would step down as CEO, and that it has appointed Justin Hotard to take over his role.Hotard, who will take up the position on April 1, is currently the executive vice president and general manager of Data Center & AI Group at Intel, according to the chipmaker's website.Telecom gear makers, struggling with lower sales of 5G equipment, have been looking for ways to diversify their markets and break into growing areas such as artificial intelligence.\"He has a strong track record of accelerating growth in technology companies along with vast expertise in AI and data centre markets, which are critical areas for Nokia's future growth,\" Nokia's Chair Sari Baldauf said in a statement.Shares were up 1.6% at 4.7 euros by 0854 GMT on Helsinki's stock exchange, which was up just 0.45%.JPMorgan analysts called the CEO transition a surprise as they said Lundmark had been successful at \"steadying the ship\".\"Given that a new CEO has already been appointed, it looks like this transition was in the works for some time. With the Datacentre and AI background of the new CEO, it is clear which areas Nokia wants to focus on,\" they said in a note.This view was echoed by analysts at Inderes, who see the change as a strategic shift towards Nokia's Network Infrastructure unit, where data centres and AI investments are fostering new growth opportunities.Last year, Nokia made a move to buy U.S. optical networking gear maker Infinera in a $2.3 billion deal to gain from the billions of dollars in investment pouring into data centres to cater to the rise of artificial intelligence.Lundmark, who was appointed as Nokia's CEO in 2020, will stay on as an advisor to Hotard until the end of the year, the company said.In September, Nokia declined media reports saying the company was looking for a new chief executive.\"The planning for this leadership transition was initiated when Pekka indicated to the Board that he would like to consider moving on from executive roles when the repositioning of the business was in a more advanced stage, and when the right successor had been identified,\" Baldauf said.Nokia shares are up 27.85% over the past year, but are down more than 90% since peaking in June 2000.Its infrastructure business, increasingly integrating AI technologies, focuses on building and maintaining communication systems, including data centres, servers, and routers.Its mobile networks unit concentrates on technologies and services enabling mobile communication, including the development and management of cell towers and 5G technologies.(Reporting by Stine Jacobsen, editing by Louise Breusch Rasmussen, Varun H K, Anne Kauranen and Louise Heavens)"

The weightings will, of course, change as their market caps fluctuate.Just as Wall Street moved on from the Nifty 50 in the 1970s as the term's popularity and usefulness waned, the so-called FANG or FAANG stocks have lost their bite. Replacing them in the lexicon du jour is the phrase Magnificent Seven Stocks: Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.From GOOGL, AAPL and AMZN to META, MSFT, NVDA and TSLA, the Magnificent Seven stocks account for around half of the weighting of the Nasdaq.Unlike the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes are market-capitalization weighted.As a result, the combined market caps of the Magnificent Seven stocks have a disproportional influence on the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100.To help address this issue, the Nasdaq rebalanced the index on July 24. That reduced the individual weightings of the Magnificent Seven stocks. But the rebalancing simply changed the total weighting of these seven megacaps from over 50% to nearly 50%.In short, the Nasdaq 100 remains heavily concentrated on these megacap growth stocks.Follow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani."

        "source": "Investor's Business Daily",
        "content": "Rivian (RIVN) reports fourth-quarter earnings and revenue late on Feb. 20 and investors will arguably be more interested in seeing whether the company will hit its target of positive gross profit per vehicle in Q4 than its top and bottom line numbers.RIVN fell 1.2% to 12.83 during market trade on Tuesday, after advancing 4% to 12.99 on Monday. The stock dropped less than 1% last week to 12.48. Rivian has found support at its 200-day line but is below its 50-day moving average to begin 2025 after sinking 43% in 2024.Meanwhile, Bernstein on Jan. 28 initiated coverage of Rivian with an underperform rating and a 6.10 price target, 52% below the current trading level.The firm believes Rivian has built a brand based on adventure and has the resources to scale it, but it faces slower market growth, rising competition and limits to the segments its brand can address.Bernstein analysts wrote that Rivian can succeed in its plan to reach more than 500,000 units by 2030, but that financial success for shareholders is not a given and that Rivian's breakeven is \"years away\" and the company is facing \"mounting risks.\"As of Feb. 10, FactSet pegs the average analyst rating on RIVN at overweight with an average price target of 14.76, representing 18% upside compared to current trading levels.Analysts expect Rivian to post a loss of 69 cents, down from a $1.36 per share loss a year ago, with sales increasing 6% to $1.39 billion, according to FactSet. However, the positive gross profit per vehicle target is what investors will be looking for.Rivian lost around $39,130 per vehicle in Q3, up from $32,700 per vehicle in the second quarter. In Q1, Rivian lost more than $38,700 per vehicle delivered.Rivian has repeatedly stated gross profit per vehicle as the goal for the year. The company on Nov. 7 said it remained \"on track\" for positive gross profit per vehicle by the fourth quarter. The startup has repeatedly stated its path to gross profit per unit delivered is primarily by reducing material costs, along with regulatory credits and other efforts.In early January, Rivian reported Q4 vehicle deliveries came in above forecasts, hitting its 2024 delivery target number. The EV startup delivered 14,183 vehicles in Q4 and produced 12,727 units at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois. A year ago, Rivian delivered 13,972 vehicles while producing 17,541 units.For the full year, Rivian produced 49,476 vehicles and delivered 51,579, in line with its goal of 50,500 to 52,000 deliveries. Rivian previously forecast 2024 production of 47,000 to 49,000 units.The 2024 deliveries represent low single-digit growth compared to 2023 when Rivian produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122 units.Rivian also said in early a component shortage the company reported in October is \"no longer a constraint\" on production.The U.S. Department of Energy on Nov. 25 announced the EV startup would receive a loan up to $6.6 billion.Rivian said in the announcement that, if the loan is finalized, it plans to use the federal money for the development and construction of its EV plant in Georgia, which would have an annual production capacity of 400,000 vehicles. The company said the first phase of the Georgia project is expected to start production in 2028.This comes after Rivian announced on Nov. 13 it finalized its $5.8 billion joint venture with Volkswagen (VWAGY).The deal gives Volkswagen access to Rivian's software technology, while the U.S. EV maker gets much-needed cash and better economies of scale. The joint venture will be headed by Wassym Bensan, Rivian's chief software officer, and Carsten Helbing, VW's chief technology officer. They'll oversee some 1,000 engineers from both companies.VW aims to launch vehicles in 2027 with tech from the JV in the Volkswagen and Scout brands.\"After seeing lots of choppiness and pain points in the supply chain in the past year, we believe this is the right partner announcement coming in at the right time as RIVN looks to navigate the ship in stormy waters with sufficient capital to fund its EV roadmap over the coming years,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote on Nov. 13.Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksThe EV startup in June announced a $5 billion joint venture with Volkswagen that involves the global auto giant investing in the EV startup in order to leverage some of its engineering and designs.However on Nov. 12, Rivian and VW announced the joint venture will see the auto giant invest up $5.8 billion in Rivian by 2027, 16% more than the original announcement.The initial $1 billion investment has been made. At the closing of the joint venture, VW will invest another $1.3 billion. The remaining $3.5 billion is expected to come in the form of equity, convertible notes and debt at \"future dates.\"The partnership will focus on software and building electric vehicle platforms at scale along with electrical architecture design and development, according to Rivian executives.The JV plans to use Rivian's existing electrical architecture and software which will enable the launch of the Rivian R2 in the first half of 2026 and \"support the expected launch of the first models from the Volkswagen Group as early as 2027.\"Through 2028, VW will fund 75% of shared platform costs in the JV with Rivian covering 25% of the costs. Each company will fund 100% of the development for each brand's respective vehicles.Volkswagen recently relaunched the Scout Motors brand making all-electric SUVs and pickup trucks that bear a marked resemblance to Rivian's vehicles. Scout engineered and designed the vehicles in Michigan, and plans to build them at a new factory in South Carolina.Meanwhile on Nov. 7, Rivian reported another loss in its third-quarter, while also reaffirming its 2024 delivery outlook, as well as its goal for positive gross profit per vehicle delivered in Q4.Rivian announced a net loss of $1.08 per share in Q3  compared to a $1.44 per share loss a year ago  while revenue totaled $874 million, down 34% vs. Q3 2023.

        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken Wall Street by storm since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. However, more than two years on, this hype cycle is getting long in the tooth. Let's discuss why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) could face downside risk as AI excitement potentially fades in 2025 and beyond.Up 421% over the last three years, Nvidia has made itself the standard bearer of the AI industry by selling the graphics processing units (GPUs) that train and run these advanced algorithms. Booming demand allowed it to grow fiscal 2025 third-quarter revenue by 94% to $35.1 billion. That said, there are some early signs that this level of spending is unsustainable.According to MIT professor Daron Acemoglu, AI technology may never be capable of solving problems complex enough to justify its development costs. And the emergence of low-cost, open-source large language models (LLMs) like China's DeepSeek could make it even harder for Nvidia's clients to profit from its astronomical GPU spending. The good news is that despite Nvidia's high growth rate, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 30 is relatively affordable compared to the Nasdaq-100 average of 33. This discount suggests that some of Nvidia's long-term challenges may already be priced into its valuation, and shares may not face as much downside risk as other companies on this list. Tesla is a car company desperately trying to rebrand itself as an AI company by pouring billions into building Dojo -- an AI supercomputer designed to support its autonomous driving strategy. If successful, these efforts could transform the company by generating more high-margin software-as-a-service revenue. But that is a big \"if.\"Alarmingly, even Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has called Dojo a \"long shot\" with a potentially high payoff but a low probability of success. The problem is that the market is treating the AI pivot as a done deal when it isn't. Tesla is clearly still a car company. The automotive business represents 77% of its total sales. And it is struggling with stagnating demand. Fourth-quarter revenue dropped 8% to ($19.8 billion) year over year.Meanwhile, Tesla's forward P/E of 127 is almost four times the Nasdaq-100 average, making its shares look wildly overvalued considering its lackluster growth rate and the uncertainty about its AI transition.Like Nvidia, Palantir Technologies is another big AI winner, with shares up 757% over the last three years. The company is exciting because of its potential to introduce AI technology into the world of government and military contracts. But while Palantir's growth is respectable, its stock valuation seems to have completely lost touch with reality.Fourth-quarter revenue grew 36% year over year to $827.5 million, driven by the popularity of its AI-enhanced data analytics tool, particularly with U.S. commercial clients. Though Palantir's business is growing, it is far from the only game in town. Cloud computing giant Microsoft offers a similar platform called Fabric. And it is unclear what \"secret sauce\" Palantir has that deep-pocketed rivals can't replicate. With a forward P/E multiple of 200, Palantir's valuation doesn't seem to reflect its modest growth and the potential threat from competition. To be fair, financial markets aren't always rational. But the sheer scale of Palantir's overvaluation makes a serious dip likely. Investors may want to stay far away from all of the AI stocks on this list for the time being.Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Certain cryptocurrencies zoomed higher today as rumors swirled about the potential for new spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Spot ETFs previously served as powerful catalysts for the largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum.As of 10:23 a.m. ET, the price of Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA) had shot 12.5% higher from the late afternoon yesterday, Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) traded 5% higher, and the meme token Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) was up 1.5%.President Donald Trump's pro-crypto administration has significantly increased expectations for new possibilities in the crypto world, including the addition of more spot crypto ETFs. Spot crypto ETFs mirror the price of one cryptocurrency by actually buying and storing the cryptocurrency and then issuing a certain number of shares based on the number of tokens they own. ETFs are considered very liquid, so crypto spot ETFs are likely to increase overall exposure to a token.Recently, the well-known crypto investment firm Grayscale filed an application to list a Cardano ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, surprising some who didn't consider such an ETF a possibility. Additionally, analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence are now placing high odds of firms rolling out crypto ETFs for Litecoin and even Dogecoin.James Seyffart, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst who correctly predicted spot Bitcoin ETFs, recently said he sees a 90% chance of a Litecoin ETF over the coming months and a 75% chance for a Dogecoin ETF.\"We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board. Mainly focused on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin for now,\" Seyffart said. \"Big implications/expectations in these odds are that Filings will be acknowledged. Likely this week for XRP and Dogecoin.\"Seyffart added that, aside from Litecoin, the odds of any of these ETFs receiving approval would have been very low if the Democrats still controlled Congress, so crypto firms clearly think the time is now. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken steps to show that the agency is more crypto-friendly, Trump's nominee to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, still may not receive approval until April. Atkins is a former SEC commissioner who recently led a consulting firm that helps clients navigate the financials and crypto sectors.As of this morning, the rise of Cardano, Litecoin, and Dogecoin seemed to be an outlier in the crypto sector, so the ETF news is clearly a big reason. Getting a spot crypto ETF turned out to be very bullish for Bitcoin and Ethereum, so I would expect all three of these tokens to react favorably as more news emerges around these developments.Cardano trades on a crypto network believed to be one of the most technically sound. The network can supposedly process 9,900 transactions per second. For this reason, I think investors can buy Cardano, although I wouldn't recommend too big of a position just yet due to its volatility. While I do have a small position in Litecoin left from a while ago, I don't have much interest in this token or Dogecoin at this time.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then youll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If youre worried youve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before its too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, youd have $346,349!*Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, youd have $43,160!*Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, youd have $554,176!*Right now, were issuing Double Down alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.Learn more *Stock Advisor returns as of February 3, 2025Bram Berkowitz has positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and XRP.

The food-delivery firm's profitability will be in focus for DoorDash stock investors, after the company reported its first quarterly profit as a public company late last year.DoorDash stock is up more than 60% over the past 12 months. Shares have been helped by steady order growth that analysts say shows the staying power of the \"convenience economy.\"Here's what to watch from the company's fourth-quarter results. Note: This article will be updated with results. Wall Street expects earnings of 34 cents per share, swinging from a 39 cent per-share loss in the same period a year earlier, according to FactSet.

After that peak  which followed the stocks stellar performance in 2022 and 2023  SMCI shares began to waver as the server maker struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations and grappled with the fallout from a scathing report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research.Hindenburg last August took a short position on SMCI and accused the company of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Quickly after, the US Department of Justice reportedly launched a probe into Super Micros accounting practices, its accountant resigned, and the companys quarterly earnings missed expectations. Adding to its woes, the server maker faced delisting by the Nasdaq after delaying its quarterly and annual SEC filings.Hindenburg shut down in mid-January.

Should the stock break below that important support level, it could have a clear shot to the 200-day moving average of $286.Tesla's 52-week low is $142.05 hit on April 22, 2024.\"Given the considerable run up in the shares as performance and expected future performance have by equal measure deteriorated, we sense a high risk of mean reversion (including by potential catalysts that may be difficult to foresee at present) and for this reason continue to recommend caution with regard to an investment in Tesla shares,\" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a new client note.Brinkman is one of the most bearish sell-side analysts on Tesla, with an Underperform rating and $135 price target.The reasons Tesla's stock is under pressure are numerous.For one, numbers on Tesla sales from important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand.Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to new data released this week from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December.Australia's Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) reported Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January.Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from President Trump stand to raise costs for Tesla and other EV makers.On Monday, Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla.Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either  a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies.\"Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape,\" Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing.And lastly, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired.The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year due to price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup.\"They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak ... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter,\" Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief, calling the results \"kind of squishy.\"Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have aggressively marked down earnings per share estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 in the wake of the lackluster earnings report.\"Tesla faces a variety of risks given its broad reach. On automotive, we believe the largest risk is demand softness/stagnation related to EV fatigue and/or competition,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu pointed out in a note.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Berkshire Hathaway also sold Bank of America (BAC), another major holding, among other key Q3 stock trades.In Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway continued to sell Bank of America stock; hiked its stake in Sirius XM (SIRI); and bought shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and VeriSign (VRSN), an internet domain-name registry company. More details about the conglomerate's Q4 stock buys and sells will come in a 13F filing in mid February.Berkshire continues to buy Siri stock in the current quarter, filings showed on Feb. 4.

Take Coca-Cola, which has grown dividends for more than 50 years.Between 1965 and 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio posted a 19.8% compound annual gain. That is nearly double the 10.2% return of the S&P 500 index, with dividends included.Buffett is known as a buy-and-hold investor, hanging on to stocks for years and even decades. But there has been rapid turnover lately.Since 2020, the investing legend has dumped many financial, drug and airline stocks  not long after buying them for the first time.However, Buffett continues to prioritize finding and buying quality stocks at a fair price  and holding them for the long term. He patiently builds those positions over time.Buffett has owned Coca-Cola and American Express for several decades, and Apple since 2016.Apple now makes up 26% of Berkshire's total equity portfolio, up from 6% in 2016.Investor's Business Daily created a screen of stocks based on the Buffett investment strategy.IBD generally uses a different stock-picking strategy than Warren Buffett does.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock fell early Tuesday, continuing its recent tumble, as reports emerged late Monday that an investor group, headed by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, launched an unsolicited takeover bid worth $97.4 billion for Sam Altman's OpenAI, the artificial intelligence leader.Oppenheimer analysts on Tuesday called Musk's bid for OpenAI \"a distraction from TSLA's challenges\" as the research firm kept a perform (neutral) rating on Tesla stock. Oppenheimer said Musk's offer represented a 38% discount to OpenAI's October 2024 capital raise and was unlikely to lead to any meaningful discussions.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, wrote Tuesday that the bid is just the latest in the feud between Musk and Altman.\"The AI Arms Race is heating up in Big Tech and OpenAI has a very strong market position which poses a risk to other tech players including Musk. We would expect the OpenAI Board to formally reject this bid and continue its capital-raising process although the Musk-led bid is a fly in the ointment for Altman and OpenAI,\" Ives wrote.TSLA fell 1.5% to 344.60 during early market action on Tuesday, hitting a fresh two-month low of 342.75, after dipping 3% to 350.73 on Monday. The stock sold off last week, threatening to break decisively below a recent consolidation. Tesla initially rallied after reporting fourth-quarter earnings late on Jan. 29 but has reversed lower.The Oppenheimer analysts also see \"increasing risks\" to Tesla estimates as electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle \"competition intensifies.\"\"Even with TSLA meeting its June 2025 timeline for driverless covers in (Texas), we still see TSLA as one of several autonomous technology providers, suggesting competition on price and performance,\" Oppenheimer analysts wrote Tuesday.The firm also believes Musk's political activity \"risks alienating consumers and employees as the Trump administration tests the limits of its power.\"This comes as Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro on Monday dropped his Tesla stock price target to 474 from 492 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. Gengaro cited Tesla's Q4 results, uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump and Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration as reasons for the price target cut.The firm wrote that \"Tesla net favorability rating [is] nearing all-time lows,\" based on its in-house tracking of public opinion of potential Tesla vehicle buyers. Gengaro said this could hurt near-term sales and that the unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk.Meanwhile, Tesla sales have tumbled in Europe to start 2025, another sign that Musk's increasingly political statements are hurting the brand there as well as in the U.S. Meanwhile, it's possible the recent stock decline reflects an ongoing reevaluation of Tesla's earnings report and conference call, as well as its near-term self-driving targets.Following Q4 earnings, analysts 2025 profit estimates have been coming down. As of Feb. 10, Tesla's 2025 EPS is expected to come in at $2.94, down 11% from the $3.31 expectation prior to Q4 earnings, according to FactSet. Estimates for 2026 have come down significantly as well.Tesla annual earnings are now not forecast to rise above the 2002 peak of $4.07 per share until 2027, according to FactSet.TSLA tumbled 10.6% last week. With Monday's decline, shares are nearly 30% below their traditional 488.54 record high from Dec. 18, according to MarketSurge charts.Tesla stock has dropped since hitting resistance on Jan. 31 at a downward-sloping trendline. If TSLA stock rebounds from here the pattern would be a double-bottom base with a 439.74 buy point.How To Buy StocksThe relative strength line for Tesla stock is also at a two-month low.The stock consolidated in January, pausing after a scorching hot fourth quarter where Tesla stock logged most of its 63% advance for 2024, especially after Trump's election win.Tesla stock ranks third in the 35-stock IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group.

The Dow industrials fell almost 100 points, or 0.2%. IBM (IBM)  outperformed with a rise of nearly 2% while Salesforce (CRM) fell 1.3%.The Nasdaq composite was down 0.2%. But the tech-heavy index is holding above its 50-day moving average for now after retaking the benchmark Monday.Fallen chip giant Intel (INTC) outperformed in the Nasdaq as it rallied more than 6%, but remains mired in a downtrend. GlobalFoundries (GFS) was up 4% and trying to move off a three-month low.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.2%. Ecolab (ECL) was among the strongest performers in the index, clearing a 262.61 entry following earnings. Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) dived nearly 17% on underwhelming guidance.The S&P 500 sectors were mixed, but with a downside bias.

Revenue growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, up 31% to $2.81 billion. This was above the FactSet consensus of $2.73 billion.Shopify said it expects revenue to grow at a mid-20s percentage rate in Q1.

        "source": "Investor's Business Daily",
        "content": "Enterprise software maker Databricks found itself in the catbird seat when much of corporate America scrambled to make artificial intelligence a bigger part of their business strategies. But competition has also intensified with rival Snowflake (SNOW) and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) as they help companies make their proprietary data actionable in new ways.Torrid growth has put San Francisco-based Databricks, a maker of data analytics and data management software, on Wall Street's radar. But the software maker hasn't announced plans for an initial public offering yet and it might not happen in 2025.What's clear is that Databricks, founded by seven data scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, is on a roll, with revenue growing at 60% year-over-year.At UC Berkeley, Databricks founders created Apache Spark  open source software for data storage and analysis. Started in 2013, Databricks quickly won over computer engineers with its software, optimized for cloud computing and more advanced than traditional relational databases.Already growing fast, the company moved quickly to capitalize on the emergence of \"generative\"AI and ChatGPT-type conversational co-pilots. Many companies now want to search their proprietary data to gain new business insights and a competitive edge.But first, corporate data needs to be organized and made reliable so it can used for training AI systems. Databricks offers tools for companies to customize off-the-shelf, large language models (LLMs) with their proprietary data.\"We started in the machine learning, data science world. We were doing AI before AI was cool,\" Databricks Chief Revenue Officer Ron Gabrisko told IBD in an interview. He added: \"We have several hundreds of millions of dollars (of revenue) in the AI, machine learning, data science space.\"Databricks expected its annualized revenue run rate to cross $3 billion in the December quarter. In the September quarter, its new data warehousing product achieved a $600 million revenue run rate, growing 150%.Gabrisko rattled off a few examples of Databricks customers in the AI space. Biotech firm Regeneron (REGN) discovered a new liver cancer cure using genome data and Databricks tools, he said, while large retail customers predict inventory needs.Other Databricks customers using AI include Mastercard (MA), electric vehicle maker Rivian and Shell, he added.\"We call it data intelligence. AI isn't really valuable without your data, at least in the enterprise,\" Gabrisko added. \"The new trend with LLMs is making it easier to interact with data sets. We think the market is going to consolidate around this concept of data intelligence where you have all these AI use cases.\"Wall Street is paying attention.\"Databricks has become the key partner for Fortune 500 customers in their gen AI journeys and is one of the hottest private companies in tech,\" said a Wolfe Research report.In December, Databricks raised $10 billion in a funding round that valued it at $62 billion. It also recently added $5.25 billion in debt financing. So there's no pressing need for an IPO.In addition to Snowflake, an emerging rival in business intelligence is Palantir. Palantir stock has surged.Meanwhile, Snowflake stock has been pressured by views Dataricks is gaining market share.\"The gap between Databricks and Snowflake is narrowing, with Databricks announcing a $3 billion revenue 2025 run rate versus Snowflake at $3.8 billion,\" said a Jefferies report.In 2020, Snowflake pulled off the largest IPO by a software company. The Snowflake IPO in 2020 raised $3.4 billion. But Databricks might top that when it goes public.Backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Databricks and Snowflake came to market from different starting points. But the two companies have converged.Snowflake's data warehouse technology focused on transactional \"structured\" data from spreadsheets, financial records or customer information.Databricks builds \"data lake\" technology. It's geared for structured data as well as \"unstructured\" data such as images, social media posts, emails, audio files and sensor data.For Snowflake, the problem is that amid the emergence of generative AI the market is clearly shifting to data lakes from data warehouses.\"Many trends (data lakes, open formats, unstructured data) appear to favor Databricks,\" said a UBS report.Still, Snowflake seems to be waging a counterattack under a new chief executive. Snowflake stock has gained 20% in 2025.Gabrisko pulled no punches in talking about the rivalry.\"I would say Snowflake has a good cloud data warehouse,\" he said. \"They kind of missed the boat with data lakes with AI and machine learning. I would say we're at least five years ahead of them in terms of innovation. Most of our customers would consider snowflake legacy technology. We've migrated over 200 customers from Snowflake to Databricks including eight of their top 10 customers.\"Meanwhile, Databricks acquired AI startup Mosaic for $1.3 billion in 2023. The purchase enabled Databricks to build its own LLM called DBRX.Generative AI relies on LLMs, which require massive amounts of data to be trained. Large language models allow users to interact with AI systems without the need to write algorithms.In the enterprise market, organizations have been developing small language models, or SLMs, using company data. The rise of free open-source models along with improved data science is making small language models more economical.Also, Databricks has shelved plans to build more LLMs and is working closely with Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META), which is a leading developer of open-source models. Meanwhile, Palantir is working with Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.Aside from Mosiac, well-funded Databricks has made other acquisitions. They included data management startup Tabular for reportedly $1 billion in June 2024.Meanwhile, other deals included Arcion, Einblick, Lilac, Rubicon, Okera, and bit.io.With the deals and internal hiring, Databricks has grown to more than 9,700 employees. Ahead of a possible IPO, it generates positive free cash flow, a key financial metric.What's more, Databricks has over 12,000 customers, including 500 that generate over $1 million in annual recurring revenue. While Databricks works with all the big cloud platforms, Microsoft (MSFT) is a key partner.Further, Gabrisko says it's early days in enterprise AI adoption.\"We have 12,000 customers. But we're only touching a smallish percentage of their overall data estate,\" Gabrisko said.He added: \"There's lots of data still on premise or in other systems. So I think the market's massive, and the amount of data increases every single day. Databricks is the innovation leader in data intelligence and we're growing faster than any other software company. And again, I think a big reason is the (market's) future is a lake house and data intelligence with AI  making forward looking predictions on any data specific to your enterprise.\"Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @reinhardtk_tech for updates on artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and cloud computing."

This enormous amount of revenue highlights just how pivotal a small group of companies are for the economy.Now that more than 60% of the S&P 500 reported their 2024 results, investors get a glimpse of how business is looking. And so far, so good.Revenue growth is coming in at 5.2% for the year, says John Butters of Factset. That's up slightly from the 5.0% revenue growth anticipated at the end of 2024.And some of the absolute numbers are strong, too. The S&P 500 are now expected to post total revenue of $17 trillion for the full year of 2024. There are some giant contributors to that tally as well.Amazon is narrowing the gap, but Walmart is still the nation's biggest source of revenue in 2024. The retailer is seen hauling in $676.3 billion in revenue in calendar 2024. That amounts to $21,742 every second of the day.Investors are responding positively, pushing shares of Walmart up nearly 14% this year. That gives the Bentonville, Ark.-based firm an RS Rating of 94. Additionally, analysts think the company will boost profit by 12% in both 2025 and 2026. The stock is etching out a flat base now.But Amazon is close on Walmart's heels. Amazon pulled in revenue of nearly $638 billion in 2024, or $20,511 every second. Shares of Amazon are strong, too, rising 6.3% this year. The stock carries an RS Rating of 88. Earnings are seen rising 14% in 2025 and 20% in 2026.Given the size of some S&P 500 companies' revenue, now you can see why investors are so eager to own shares of the giants.Based on annual results or estimatesFollow Matt Krantz on X (Twitter) @mattkrantz"

        "content": "Elliott Management has a more than $2.5 billion investment in Phillips 66 (PSX) and is reportedly intent on forcing the company to narrow its focus on downstream refining and spinoff off its midstream business segment. PSX moved higher before the stock market opened on the news.The hedge fund, known for shaking up companies by grabbing board seats and spinning off business segments to increase shareholder value, is reportedly pushing Phillips 66 to make several business changes, including to sell or spinoff its midstream business, The Wall Street Journal reported late Monday.While Phillips 66 is primarily an oil refiner. Its midstream business generates about half of the income that its refining segment does. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and many other oil producers experienced weak refining margins in 2024, as U.S. oil prices averaged just above $76 a barrel and gasoline prices sagged to $3.19 for the year.Phillips 66 stock jumped 5.5% prior to the opening bell for Tuesday's stock market trade after gaining 2.8% to 123.71 on Monday. PSX hit a high of 174.08 in April 2024 but has retreated around 30% from those levels. The stock has dropped 29% from its April 2024 high and is currently well below its 200-day line.In November 2023 Elliott Management revealed it had a $1 billion stake in Phillips 66 as it pushed for at least two new board appointments as part of measures to \"reassure investors that Phillips 66 is in the best possible position to achieve its value-creation potential.\"\"Phillips 66's performance has declined as it has shifted its focus away from its refining segment,\" Elliott wrote to the board in late 2023, adding PSX has lagged behind peers Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Valero Energy (VLO).\"Over the past three years, as Phillips 66 has fallen further and further behind, its stock has meaningfully underperformed these peers,\" the activist investor added.PSX stock ended November 2023 trading at 128.89, meaning that prior to Tuesday's stock market open it was down 4% since Elliott's original ultimatum.A few months after sending that letter, Phillips 66 and Elliott came to an agreement on a new board member. A second director has not yet been named.Meanwhile, it was revealed over the weekend that Elliott, which has invested in several companies in the energy sector, most recently has built an undisclosed stake in U.K. oil major BP (BP).Phillips 66 stock has a 19 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock fell early Tuesday, continuing its recent tumble, as the EV giant declined Monday after receiving a price target cut based on low \"favorability ratings and \"mixed\" fourth-quarter results in late January.Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro on Monday dropped his Tesla stock price target to 474 from 492 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. Gengaro cited Tesla's Q4 results, uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump Trump Administration, Chief Executive Elon Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration as reasons for the price target cut.The firm wrote that \"Tesla net favorability rating [is] nearing all-time lows,\" based on its in-house tracking of public opinion of potential Tesla vehicle buyers. Gengaro said this could hurt near-term sales and that the unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk. However, the analyst added that Tesla positives include expectations of a lower priced vehicle due out in the first half of 2025 and possible Optimus humanoid robot production ramping this year.TSLA edged down 0.6% during premarket action on Tuesday after hitting a fresh two-month low of 350.51 early Monday before ending the day down 3% to 350.73.Tesla initially rallied after reporting fourth-quarter earnings late on Jan. 29 but has reversed lower.Tesla sales have tumbled in Europe to start 2025, another sign that Musk's increasingly political statements are hurting the brand there as well as in the U.S. Meanwhile, it's possible the recent stock decline reflects an ongoing re-evaluation of Tesla's earnings report and conference call, as well as its near-term self-driving targets.Following Q4 earnings, analyst 2025 profit estimates have been coming down. As of Feb. 10, Tesla's 2025 EPS is expected to come in at $2.94, down 11% from the $3.31 expectation prior to Q4 earnings, according to FactSet. Estimates for 2026 have come down significantly as well.Tesla annual earnings are now not forecast to rise above the 2002 peak of $4.07 per share until 2027, according to FactSet.TSLA tumbled 10.6% last week. With Monday's decline, shares are nearly 30% below their traditional 488.54 record high from Dec. 18, according to MarketSurge charts.Tesla stock has dropped since hitting resistance on Jan. 31 at a downward-sloping trendline. If TSLA stock rebounds from here the pattern would be a double-bottom base with a 439.74 buy point.How To Buy StocksThe relative strength line for Tesla stock is also at a two-month low.The stock consolidated in January, pausing after a scorching hot fourth quarter where Tesla stock logged most of its 63% advance for 2024, especially after Trump's election win.Tesla stock ranks third in the 35-stock IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group.

And it could be in the form of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve.Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok says the US economy is already running at a healthy 3% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth pace, supported by high stock prices, investments in AI data centers by the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), and strong defense spending. Layering on Trump tariffs would add fuel to the economic fire and drive up inflation, warns the veteran economist.\"So if with that backdrop we have policies that are now lifting inflation modestly from an already too high level, then my view would certainly be that then maybe we are not done with the Fed hiking rates. There is a risk that we could still have a rate hike later this year,\" Slok told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).This embedded content is not available in your region.Slok believes that should inflation accelerate as tariffs take hold, the first rate hike from Fed could come at its mid-June meeting. More may follow, Slok says, which could surprise a market that has settled into the view of the Fed standing pat on rates this year  if not lowering them further.\"If we have a significant increase in inflation because of a strong economy and potentially some policies that give a modest lift to inflation, then you could have several hikes later this year,\" Slok added.The seeds for a renewed bout of inflation are being planted.On Monday, president Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.Last Tuesday, the president imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on top of existing tariffs on the country. China retaliated, placing tariffs on select chips and metals. It also began investigating Google (GOOG) and blacklisted US apparel brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, operated by PVH Corp. (PVH).Trump recently agreed to pause 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days.Estimates on the impact of tariffs on inflation vary, but economists agree there will some consequences.A new report from Deutsche Bank economists project the steel and aluminum tariffs alone could boost the core personal expenditures price index (PCE)  a key read on inflation  by 0.4%.Should the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go through, inflation could rise more than 3.5%, Deutsche Bank said. On this front, Goldman Sachs economists estimated \"long-term\" 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico imports could lift the PCE by 0.7% and hurt GDP by 0.4%.Slok says the market hasn't priced in the prospect of rate hikes yet.The markets would be forced to adjust their profit estimates lower, explained Goldman Sachs chief US strategist David Kostin.If the US implements sustained tariffs on exports consistent with those currently outlined, it would likely cut earnings per share for the S&P 500 by 2% to 3%, Kostin found.If company managements decide to absorb the higher input costs, then profit margins would be squeezed. If companies pass along the higher costs to end customers, then sales volumes may suffer. Firms may try to push back on their suppliers and ask them to absorb part of the cost of the tariff through lower prices,\" said Kostin.Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "Coca-Cola (KO) posted another strong quarter as it gains ground on rival PepsiCo (PEP).In its fourth quarter earnings report, which came out before market open on Tuesday, the company bested the Street's estimates across the board. Revenue came in at $11.5 billion, compared to expectation of $10.67 billion. Earnings per shares came in $0.55, compared to expectation of $0.52. That was largely drive by higher price/mix, which grew 9%, while unit case volume increased 2%.CEO James Quincey said the company continues to \"to lead through dynamic external environments\" with \"global scale\" and \"local-market expertise\" that allows it to \"capture the vast opportunities ahead.\"It's only a handful of these consumer staple companies that are actually delivering the kind of growth that you would expect, or growth in line with their targets,\" Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance prior to earnings. The company strikes \"a decent balance between volume growth and price.\"For the full year, organic revenue grew 12%, ahead of the 10% increase the company expected as higher prices have helped counter headwinds like more cautious consumers, less favorable commodity costs, and more challenging trends in international markets.\"We believe [Coca-Cola's] ability to deliver strong positive mid-single digit organic revenue growth in an environment where many global staples peers are likely to deliver positive low-single digit growth (and in some cases are struggling to hit their algorithm) continues to stand out,\" UBS analyst Peter Grom said in a note.Shares of the beverage giant are up 7% in the past year, compared to a 16% drop for PepsiCo. It still trails behind the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 20% gain.In 2025, the company expects to deliver organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, as well as adjusted earnings growth of 2% to 3%.Here's what Coca-Cola reported in the fourth quarter, compared to what Wall Street expectedRevenue: $11.5 billion versus $10.67 billionAdjusted earnings per share: $0.55 versus $0.52Price/mix growth: 9% versus 6.71%Unit case volume growth: +2% versus -0.21%Spillane said previously if the Latin America market ends the year \"better than the last couple of quarters ... that would be a good sign for 2025.\"For Q4, the region's net revenue grew 3%, while price/mix and unit case volume were up 23% and 2%, respectively, led by the growth of Coca-Cola drinks in the region.In North America, unit case volume grew 1%, driven by \"growth in sparkling flavors, juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and Trademark Coca-Cola.\" Price/mix for the region also grew 12%, \"driven by pricing actions in the marketplace and favorable mix,\" the company said.For the full-year, non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages gained value share, with gains across Coca-Cola and juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.The impact of potential tariffs and inflation on agriculture commodities, including prices of orange juice, will also be headwinds for management to address.In the previous third quarter earnings call with investors, CFO John Murphy said he expects 2025 to be \"a more normalized pricing environment.\"Fast food chains like McDonald's (MCD), Burger King (QSR), and Taco Bell (YUM) have been trying to boost foot traffic with value and meal deals. Coca-Cola reportedly played a role in the $5 meal bundle at McDonald's.

        "content": "McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) stock is gaining ground in Monday's trading. The fast-food giant's share price was up 4.5% as of noon ET, amid the backdrop of a 0.5% gain for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and a 1.1% gain for the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).McDonald's reported its fourth-quarter results before the market opened this morning, and sales and earnings performance for the period actually came in below expectations. But despite missing Wall Street's top-line and bottom-line targets, the business showed signs of improvement in key areas -- and management outlined strategies that have investors feeling bullish.In last year's fourth quarter, McDonald's posted non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 on sales of $6.39 billion. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.86 on revenue of $6.48 billion. Overall revenue was down 0.3% year over year in the period, and adjusted earnings per share were down 4%.Despite the sales decline, investors are finding some bright spots in the revenue composition. While same-store sales in the U.S. declined 1.4% compared to the prior-year period due to a decline in spending per check, sales for the international operated markets segment actually increased 0.1% -- coming in far better than the roughly 1.1% decline forecasted by Wall Street. Meanwhile, revenue for the international developmental licensed markets segment increased 4.1% year over year -- far better than the roughly 0.4% decline called for by the average Wall Street estimate.While McDonald's has seen some persistent challenges related to an E. coli outbreak last year, management expects that these issues will be in the rearview mirror by the second quarter. As a result, profitability is expected to see a significant improvement.McDonald's says that it will continue to focus on building out its digital ordering platform and prioritizing value-oriented menu offerings. On the other hand, the company says that it's already seeing improvements for average check amounts and customer traffic in the U.S. and other markets.The company anticipates that the impact of menu and digital ordering initiatives and improving trends for check size and customer traffic will deliver results improvements that really start to show up in the second quarter. With McDonald's stock up just 6% over the last year despite a 21% rally for the S&P 500 index, the company's share price could have room to run if trends shape up in line with management's expectations.Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and McDonald's wasnt one of them.

        "content": "By Arunima Kumar(Reuters) - BP reported quarterly profit of $1.17 billion on Tuesday, weaker than expected and the lowest in four years, while the company promised to reset its strategy, after news broke at the weekend that investor Elliott Management had built up a stake.BP joins other oil majors that have experienced a decline in earnings throughout 2024, following record earnings in the previous two years, as energy prices stabilised and global oil demand weakened.But BP has underperformed its peers and pressure has mounted on CEO Murray Auchincloss to deliver change.Its share price was around flat shortly after the market opening, up 0.6% at 467.90 pence.On Monday, it had rallied strongly on expectations Elliott's acquisition of an undisclosed stake would enforce change.The 61% drop in the fourth-quarter compared with the previous year made the results the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2020, when pandemic lockdowns shrank demand for oil.\"We now plan to fundamentally reset our strategy and drive further improvements in performance, all in service of growing cash flow and returns,\" Auchincloss said in a statement.Auchincloss has been working towards rebuilding investor confidence in the company, following the abrupt resignation of his predecessor Bernard Looney in September 2023 for failing to disclose relationships with employees.The company's quarterly earnings were dragged down by weaker realised refining margins. Its fourth-quarter average refining marker margin stood at $13.1 per barrel, down from last year's $18.5 per barrel.For the current quarter, BP expects margins to remain low and a lower level of refinery turnaround activity compared with the fourth-quarter.BP's underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net income, dropped to $1.17 billion in the three months ended December 31, from last year's $2.99 billion.That compared with forecasts of $1.26 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts and $1.20 billion, according to data complied by LSEG.(This story has been corrected to show that profit was lower, not higher, than expectations in paragraph 1)(Reporting by Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich and Barbara Lewis)"

The company invested another $7.33 billion in 2024, according to its latest earnings release.The heavy spending has squeezed profitability, with SMIC's gross margin declining to around 20% in 2023 from over 30% in 2021-2022.SMIC reported a gross margin of 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with 16.4% a year earlier.(Reporting by Liam Mo and Brenda Goh, Editing by Louise Heavens)"

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanOld and new economy stocks keep Wall Street pumped up this week as tech and steel sectors advance on a mix of tariff news and an artificial intelligence buzz, with Treasuries in thrall to Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell's latest trip to Congress.U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday to a flat 25% \"without exceptions or exemptions,\" in a move he hopes helps struggling U.S. firms in the sector but which risks sparking a multi-front trade war.Steel imports account for 23% of American steel consumption in 2023, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico the largest suppliers.Trump also said he would, within two days, follow Monday's action with reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on U.S. goods, looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.And in another aside, he said he had spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office on January 20 - without offering details on the topics of their conversation.The upshot of the tariffs was a lift to U.S. steelmakers on Monday, with shares in overseas rivals taking another marginal hit on Tuesday. Thyssenkrupp and Salzgitter in Germany, for example, were down 1% each earlier.The lift to U.S. metals firms - with the likes of Nucor, U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics gaining 4% on Monday and Alcoa up 2% - helped the benchmark S&P500 recover early losses on Monday and end higher.Currency markets appeared to brush the steel tariffs aside, with the dollar only marginally higher. Gold climbed to a another record high, however, with spot gold briefly hitting $2,942.70 per ounce before retreating.Stock futures gave back some of those index gains ahead of Tuesday's bell, in part due to rising long-term Treasury yields as Powell prepared his semi-annual congressional testimony and ahead of the week's big debt sales.AI EXCITEMENTBut stocks were buoyed by a new leg higher in tech on Monday, too. AI chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom rose almost 3%.Some of the latest AI excitement came from news that a consortium led by Elon Musk offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI - a twist in the billionaire' s fight to block the AI startup's transition to a for-profit firm. Musk's auto giant Tesla lost 3% on the report.Broader optimism in U.S. stocks comes from the latest tallies on the corporate earnings season - now more than half way through.With more than 60% of S&P500 firms having reported fourth quarter updates, the annual aggregate profit growth for the index is tracking close to 15% - significantly higher than the 10% expected on January 1. At almost 5%, annual revenue growth is also higher than pencilled in at the start of the year.Those sorts of profit gains, still brisk economic growth, tight labor markets and rising import tariffs all give the Fed ample cause to pause its credit easing campaign.Powell is likely to indicate that in his testimony later in the day - with markets now only fully priced for one rate cut this year and not before September.While Friday's news of an unexpectedly large pickup in U.S. wage growth last month was one reason for those tempered rate expectations, there were also offsets on Monday. The New York Fed's latest household survey saw one-year inflation expectations holding steady about 3%.The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday it was too early to assess the impact of the Trump tariff plans.But with crude oil prices rising again and another heavy week of Treasury auctions and inflation data ahead, 10-year yields pushed back above 4.5%.Part of that backup was related to the slightly bizarre Trump reference at the weekend to possible fraudulent Treasury debt accounting - another aside that went largely unexplained but was related to Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency' examination of Treasury accounts.Elsewhere, Chinese mainland and Hong Kong stocks slipped back on the mounting tariff war news - cooling a recent rally on the China DeepSeek AI development.But also worrying was news that China's car sales fell 12% in January from a year earlier. That was the first decline since September and the biggest drop in almost a year as automakers braced for both tariffs and price wars amid intense worldwide competition. Shares in Chinese automakers Xpeng and Geely tumbled up to 10%.In Europe, stock indexes were firmer.In company news, BP reported a sub-forecast quarterly profit that was the lowest in four years as the oil giant promised to reset its strategy following news investor Elliott Management had built up a stake in the firm.On Monday, BP's shares jumped 7% on expectations Elliott's acquisition of the undisclosed stake would enforce change.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:* US January NFIB small business survey* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's semiannual monetary policy testimony before Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman, New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed chief Beth Hammack all speak. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey speaks* EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meets U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Paris* US corporate earnings: Dupont De Nemours, Super Micro Computer, Coca-Cola, Marriott, AIG, Assurant, S&P Global, Ecolab, Eversource Energy, Gilead, Edwards Lifesciences, Humana, Eversource, Masco, Welltower etc* U.S. Treasury sells $58 billion of 3-year notes(Editing by Bernadette Baum)"

        "content": "By Sheila DangHOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron's oil and gas reserves have fallen to the lowest point in at least a decade, highlighting the importance of the U.S. major's planned acquisition of oil producer Hess that has stalled due to a court battle with Exxon Mobil.Reserve replacement is one of the key metrics for investors in energy companies, as it gives a sense of how much oil and gas the companies could produce and for how long.If Chevron closes the Hess acquisition, it would gain a stake in the lucrative Guyana oilfields that are operated by Chevron's rival, Exxon.Exxon and CNOOC, the other minority partner in the Guyana field, have challenged Chevron's bid for Hess in court, saying that they have first right of refusal on Hess's equity in the project.Chevron's reserves, or the amount of oil and gas that it can potentially extract, declined from 11.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 2023 to 9.8 billion by the end of 2024. The reserves also declined in part due to sales of acreage.The low rate of reserve replacement raises \"red flags,\" said Paul Cheng, an analyst with Scotiabank, highlighting concerns about the company's longer-term prospects.Chevron said its reserve replacement ratio over the past 10-year period was 88%.The company's organic reserve replacement ratio, a metric that measures how much new oil and gas was added to the reserves compared to the amount it produced and excludes acquisitions and sales, was 45%. A ratio of 100% or more means the company is replacing its reserves at the same rate that it depletes them.Cheng said the company's replacement ratio has been below the breakeven requirement over the past three years. Scotiabank maintains a sector outperform rating for Chevron.Chevron declined to comment. During the fourth quarter earnings call, CEO Mike Wirth said the company was focused on developing high-quality oil and gas assets, including in the Gulf of Mexico.The acquisition of Hess, a $53 billion deal struck in October 2023, could improve Chevron's prospects. It would grant the company a 30% stake in more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent of discovered recoverable resource in Guyana, the company said when it announced the deal.\"The combined company is expected to have resource inventory depth into the next decade  much further than we can usually see with confidence in our business,\" Wirth said in October.Exxon has not yet reported its replacement ratio for 2024, but the No. 1 U.S. oil producer also struggled to replace its reserves in 2023 and 2022, which may have contributed to its decision to buy oil and gas producer Pioneer Natural Resources, Cheng said. Exxon declined to comment.The Pioneer acquisition last year made Exxon the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oil field.UK-based oil company Shell and French oil major TotalEnergies both have an average reserve replacement ratio over the past three years of more than 100%.(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Houston; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)"

I think Im going to cut that by two-thirds,'\" Haas said. \"That's what you need to look for.\"Right now, these leaders are giving the green light to a stock market that remains powered by AI trade.Earnings growth from tech giants like those mentioned above, along with Nvidia (NVDA) and a handful of others, have helped explain away fears about a stock market that is expensive by historical standards.Over the long run, earnings growth powers stock prices. And the beauty of buying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is that where exactly that earnings growth comes from doesn't matter so long as it exists.The bottom-line performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" has, over the last two years, even managed to mask an outright earnings downturn for the rest of the index, the \"S&P 493.\" That earnings growth would pick up to include these laggards only proved an additional boost for an already-buoyant investor class.Seen more cynically, the spending plans of a handful of tech giants playing by their own rules serve as yet another concentration risk for a market already full of them.Whether it's earnings growth or market cap or investing plans, shares in a small number of companies are setting the tone for a large swath of the stock market, for better or worse.The dramatic one-day slide seen in late January as a result of DeepSeek's purported breakthrough, for instance, shows how the trade that has given to the market can also take away. And at a moment's notice.But perhaps in a subtle but distinct contrast to (somewhat) squishy concepts like earnings and more capricious measures like market cap, announced investment plans may be the firmest measure yet for non-tech investors to track when it comes to AI.Watch this figure from these companies.And then you'll know when something's gone wrong.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock pricesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "You might not realize it, but this could arguably be described as the most important week of data on Wall Street for the first quarter -- and this has nothing to do with the steady stream of operating results being announced by the stock market's most-influential businesses.Friday, Feb. 14, marks the deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F allows investors to see which stocks Wall Street's leading money managers have been buying and selling during the previous quarter (in this instance, trading activity from Oct. 1, 2024 through Dec. 31, 2024).Though there are dozens of prominent asset managers that garner attention on Wall Street, few are more closely followed than the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) billionaire CEO is overseeing a 44-stock, $301 billion portfolio, and he's effectively doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over the last 60 years.But you don't have to wait until after the closing bell on Friday to get an idea of which stocks Buffett has been purchasing and selling. Thanks to other required filings with the SEC, we're aware of three stocks he's purchased, as well as one he's been aggressively selling.In instances where Berkshire Hathaway owns at least 10% of the outstanding shares of a public company, it's required to file Form 4 with the SEC within two business days of a transaction. Form 4 allows investors to see every purchase and sale, along with the average acquisition and disposition price.During the December-ended quarter, Buffett and his team purchased nearly $297 million worth of satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings' (NASDAQ: SIRI) stock.The Oracle of Omaha is a big believer in businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and/or moats. As the lone satellite-radio operator, Sirius XM's legal monopoly status should afford it strong subscription pricing power more often than not.Sirius XM Is also bucking the trend of terrestrial and online radio providers by not generating the bulk of its revenue from advertising. In 2024, approximately 76% of the company's net sales came from subscriptions, with around 20% tracing back to ads via Pandora, which it acquired in February 2019. The advantage of a subscription-driven operating model is that users are less likely to cancel during periods of economic weakness. In comparison, businesses aren't shy about slashing their market budget at the first hint of trouble.There's also a value proposition that speaks to Buffett amid a historically pricey stock market. Sirius XM stock is valued at roughly 8 times forecast earnings per share (EPS) in 2025, and its dividend yield is north of 4%.With the exception of Warren Buffett repurchasing close to $78 billion of his own company's shares since mid-2018, there's not a stock that's been on his buy list more consistently in recent years than integrated energy company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY).Between Dec. 17 and Dec. 19, the Oracle of Omaha gobbled up closed 8.9 million shares at a cost of more than $409 million. Since 2022 began, Berkshire has acquired over 264 million shares of Occidental common stock.Investing so aggressively in Occidental is a pretty clear indication that Berkshire's chief believes the spot price of crude oil will remain elevated or perhaps head even higher. Though all oil drillers benefit when the spot price of oil moves up, Occidental generates a disproportionate amount of its net sales from its upstream drilling operations. If the price of oil notably climbs, it benefits more than its peers. Just keep in mind that the reciprocal is also true if the spot price of crude oil declines.Buffett likely appreciates the integrated aspect of Occidental's operating model, as well. Even with its reliance on drilling, Occidental still oversees midstream and downstream assets, such as chemical plants. If the spot price of crude oil falls, these ancillary operations can partially hedge upstream weakness.Don't overlook that Berkshire Hathaway holds warrants to purchase up to 83,858,849 shares of Occidental Petroleum common stock at an exercise price of $59.624 per share. It's in Buffett's best interest if Occidental's share price remains well above this exercise price.The third stock Warren Buffett was a decisive buyer of during the fourth quarter is internet domain-name registry services giant VeriSign (NASDAQ: VRSN), which has been a continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway since the fourth quarter of 2012.According to Form 4 filings, Buffett and his team oversaw the purchase of nearly $90 million worth of VeriSign stock from Dec. 17 through Dec. 31, with this buying continuing into the first few days of the new year.Similar to Sirius XM, the Oracle of Omaha's fascination with VeriSign may have to with its legal monopoly ties. VeriSign holds the rights to register top .com and .net domains granted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (better known as ICANN). While domain name registration isn't the growth story it was when the century began, being the premier domain name registrar affords VeriSign substantial pricing power.Another reason Buffett may be attracted to VeriSign is its juicy operating margin. Although the company pays fees to ICANN and requires a certain level of infrastructure to maintain its operations, VeriSign's costs tend to be relatively low and highly predictable. On a trailing-12-month basis, the company's operating margin is approximately 69%!VeriSign's valuation is the other factor that might have enticed Buffett's buying. While it's not nearly as inexpensive as Sirius XM or Occidental Petroleum, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25 does represent an 11% discount to its average forward multiple over the last five years.However, Warren Buffett has been doing considerably more selling than buying of late. For eight consecutive quarters (Oct. 1, 2022 through Sept. 30, 2024), he's sold more stock than he's purchased, to the tune of $166.2 billion.One of the stocks the Oracle of Omaha has been selling the most aggressively is money center giant Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Since July 17, more than 266 million shares, totaling north of $10 billion in market value, have been sold. This includes $1.275 billion worth of stock sales from Oct. 1 through Oct. 15.During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett intimated (in reference to selling shares of Apple) that the corporate income tax rate was likely to climb in the future, which meant locking in sizable unrealized gains at a historically low rate would, in hindsight, be viewed favorably by investors. Dumping 26% of what's now Berkshire's No. 3 holding might represent nothing more than benign tax-advantaged selling.Then again, Bank of America is the most interest-sensitive of America's largest banks by total assets, and the Federal Reserve is in the midst of a rate-easing cycle that will, in all likelihood, reduce BofA's net interest income. If there's a silver lining for Bank of America, it's that the central bank is being slow and methodical with its monetary policy decisions, which should allow it to continue originating higher-yield loans.This persistent selling might also represent Buffett's dissatisfaction with stock valuations. When Buffett first purchased BofA preferred stock in the summer of 2011, BofA's common stock was valued at a 62% discount to book value. As of the closing bell on Feb. 5, Bank of America stock traded at a nearly 32% premium to book. Buffett is a value investor, first and foremost, and value is getting difficult to find on Wall Street.Before you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Sirius XM wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Many Wall Street analysts think the S&P 500 will rise for the third consecutive year in 2025. Projections vary, but the consensus forecast appears to be that the index could jump in the ballpark of 10%. The S&P is roughly one-third of the way to hitting that mark already.If Wall Street is right, investors could buy an S&P 500 index exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) and enjoy a decent return. But I think there are even better options for investors who want even greater gains. I predict these two Vanguard ETFs will trounce the S&P 500 this year.If I had to pick only one Vanguard ETF most likely to beat the S&P 500 in 2025, it would be the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSEMKT: VFH). This fund focuses only on the stocks of companies in the financial services sector.The Vanguard Financials ETF currently owns 409 financial stocks. Its top holdings include JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire Hathaway, Mastercard, Visa, and Bank of America. Because the ETF is weighted by market cap, these mega-cap stocks make up 30.7% of its total portfolio.This fund has only delivered an average annual return of 6.7% since its inception in January 2004. However, it has soared over the past 12 months, handily outperforming the S&P 500.You might have noticed on the chart that the Vanguard Financials ETF really opened up a lead on the S&P 500 in November 2024. It's no coincidence that's when the U.S. elections were held. The anticipated policies of the second Trump administration could be especially favorable to financial stocks, especially with the prospects of reduced regulatory burdens.The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOG) ranked as the best-performing Vanguard ETF in 2024. This fund is up more than 31% over the last 12 months compared to a gain of 23% for the S&P 500.Growth is what the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is all about. The fund attempts to track the performance of the S&P 500 Growth Index, which includes growth companies in the S&P 500.This Vanguard ETF owns 209 stocks with a median market cap of $1.1 trillion. Its top holdings include Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, and Amazon. All of these stocks except Microsoft have delivered greater gains than the S&P 500 over the past 12 months.Can the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF keep its momentum going? I think so. The seemingly insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) continues to serve as a major tailwind for many of the top growth stocks in the S&P 500. Although concerns about a threat from the Chinese AI company DeepSeek caused some of the stocks to stumble in recent weeks, especially Nvidia, I suspect this will be only a temporary downturn.While I predict the Vanguard Financials ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF will trounce the S&P 500 this year, I acknowledge the possibility that other Vanguard ETFs might perform even better. For example, the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG) was a big winner in 2024 and could step into the forefront in the coming months.I also think small-cap stocks could be ready to outperform large-cap stocks. This could set the stage for funds including the Vanguard Small Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: VB) and Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VBR) to deliver impressive gains.Before you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Financials ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Financials ETF wasnt one of them.

        "content": "By Yantoultra Ngui and Roushni NairSINGAPORE (Reuters) -Shares of DBS soared to a record high on Monday after Singapore's largest bank flagged an improvement in net interest income for 2025 and a dividend capital return plan, in line with a jump in fourth-quarter profit that met expectations.Southeast Asia's largest bank by assets now expects 2025 group net interest income to slightly exceed last year's S$15.04 billion ($11.1 billion), an upgrade from its previous forecast of remaining at 2024 levels.\"While macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties persist, the franchise and digital transformations carried out over the past decade position us well to continue delivering healthy returns,\" DBS Chief Executive Officer Piyush Gupta said in a statement.DBS's net interest margin, a key profitability gauge, rose to 2.15% during the quarter from 2.13% a year earlier.DBS, the first Singapore lender to report earnings season, said October-December net profit climbed to S$2.62 billion ($1.9 billion) from S$2.39 billion a year earlier, driven by growth in its commercial book and markets trading.This matches the mean estimate of nearly S$2.63 billion from five analysts, according to LSEG data.DBS stock hit a record high of S$46.5 earlier in the day, driving the Straits Times Index to its highest level ever.The benchmark outpaced a 0.4% slump in broader Asian markets that were affected by repeated warnings of imminent tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump, including on steel and aluminium.DBS declared a final dividend of 60 Singapore cents per share, versus 54 cents declared a year ago.It said it planned to introduce a capital return dividend of 15 Singapore cents per share per quarter to be paid out over 2025, and expected to pay out a similar amount of capital either via this plan or other mechanisms in subsequent two years.The 2025 capital return dividend plan on top of a S$3 billion buyback announced in the third quarter signaled DBS's commitment to shareholder return while striving for long-term growth, analysts said.DBS will see a change in CEO in March and investors will be focusing on potential changes. Tan Su Shan, who previously headed up DBS' institutional banking group and is currently deputy CEO, will take over from Gupta, making her the first woman to lead the bank.Singaporean banks were forecast to post stronger profits for the fourth quarter, but growth could take a hit this year as U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and other policies threaten to undermine the global economy, analysts said.

The US neighbors are also scrambling to strike a deal to avoid being subject to another set of tariffs on March 1.In tech, AI spending fears continue to drag down investor confidence in the Magnificent Seven. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) have all seen losses from weak earnings in recent weeks. Meta (META) remains the only member of the group to post double digit gains so far this year.Meta also attracted Wall Street's attention on Monday as it began to lay off workers as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pledge to cut thousands of jobs from the company in a push to find AI talent. In total around 3,600 people, or 5% of the company, are expected to be laid off in the process.In commodities, coffee futures rose 6% to an all-time high of over $4.30 a pound.

Markets are also trying to get a read on the potential implications for the US economy and monetary policy if the White Houses policies reignite inflation and subdue growth.Investors will be focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powells testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for clues about the monetary policy trajectory. Short-term inflation expectations have risen above longer-term ones to the widest gap since 2023, with the so-called five-year breakeven rate reaching 2.64% on Monday. That may support the case for a slower pace of easing, a scenario that, in theory, would be bearish for bullion since it pays no interest.Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,919.23 an ounce as of 7:50 a.m. in Singapore.

        "content": "The start of Trump 2.0 is not quite what Wall Street expected.Dealmaking had its slowest month in January in more than a decade. A prized tax break for hedge funds and private equity firms came under threat. And big banks got grilled over whether they \"debanked\" certain customers.These complications were not part of the plan when Donald Trump was elected in November, an event that set off a round of optimistic predictions about an M&A boom, looser rules and a more favorable approach to big Wall Street firms in Washington, DC.Instead bankers ended January with the lowest number of announced M&A deals within the US since that same month in 2014, according to LSEG data.Trumps new antitrust cops also signaled in the administrations second week that they werent going to give a free pass to big mergers by blocking a potential union between Hewlett Packard (HPE) and rival Juniper Networks (JNPR).And new uncertainties surrounding the presidents tariff plans are leaving many businesses unsure about when to make big moves and what direction borrowing costs might take in the weeks and months ahead.\"The uncertainties that we see from a geopolitical standpoint of view, around tariffs are  is definitely creating a little bit of uncertainties that may dent the capabilities for us, for everybody to execute, Sergio Ermotti, CEO of UBS Group AG (UBS), told analysts Monday while speaking at a UBS financial services conference in Miami.Ermotti was also quick to point out that \"it's not 1 quarter or 1 month\" that will determine the year.And to be sure, January can typically be a slower time for new deals than other parts of the calendar.The historically high level of corporate valuations may also be playing a role in a slower pace of dealmaking to start 2025, THL Partners co-CEO Scott Sperling told Yahoo Finance Live.\"That's an unusual combination, and that, in and of itself, may have muted some of the financial returns that would be possible from certain types of M&A and certain types of deal doing,\" Sperling told Yahoo Finance Live.So far the downturn is not pulling down big bank stocks.Since the beginning of January, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), have risen between 12% and 15% as of Monday while Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are up between 6% and 9%. All have outperformed major stock indexes in that period.One big unexpected development for Wall Street in the early weeks of Trump 2.0 is a high level of political heat.First President Donald Trump publicly confronted Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan at the World Economic Forum over a claim gaining traction in conservative circles: that customers are being debanked for their personal beliefs or because they are part of the crypto industry.The president also appeared to include JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in his confrontation. JPMorgan and Bank of America are the nations two largest banks. Both companies denied the claims they cut off their services to customers over personal beliefs.I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody else, I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong, Trump told Moynihan during a question-and-answer session.The GOP kept a spotlight on the debanking issue last week during hearings before Senate and House committees. Massachusetts Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren even signaled her support for the topic, saying she agreed with Trump.Banks are still optimistic, however, that fixing that issue could ultimately turn out to be a positive for them if regulators relax some of their requirements that force banks to shed certain customers.They have argued that US rules such as the Bank Secrecy Act discourage banks from dealing with customers that are considered high-risk  and that there needs to be clearer regulation on that front.Industry lobbyists are pressing for that to happen. \"An important part of the solution is fixing the regulatory structure,\" a spokesman for the bank industry advocacy group BPI said in a statement to Yahoo Finance.Lobbyists for the private equity and hedge fund industries may also be unexpectedly busy this year after the White House made it clear that Trump wants to close a tax break known as a carried interest deduction.It allows investment managers to pay a lower capital gains tax rate on the income they receive from their work as compensation. Its no small matter, with many capital gains subject to 23.8% taxes while the rate for regular wage income can be double that.\"The president is committed to working with Congress to get this done,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Historically, few companies have demonstrated more millionaire-maker potential than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The tech giant's shares have soared by more than 22,000% over the last decade, generating plenty of shareholder wealth in the process.That said, with a market cap of $3 trillion, Nvidia is already the third-largest company in the world. Growing concerns about the sustainability of AI hardware spending raise questions about how much more it can realistically rise. Let's dig deeper to find out what the future may hold.Since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022, tech giants have been scrambling to stay competitive in the market for large language models (LLMs), a type of AI algorithm that can create conversational responses based on a trained dataset. To this end, they have poured billions of dollars into purchasing Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and run these complex programs.For so-called hyperscalers like Alphabet and Amazon, this spending makes clear business sense because they can \"rent out\" their AI computing power to start-ups via their cloud computing platforms. However, for other major clients like Meta Platforms (which plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion largely on AI-related capital expenditures), the potential returns for pouring so much money into Nvidia hardware look weaker.Meta seems to be trying to stay relevant in an opportunity it has no clear way to monetize. And it might only be a matter of time before the company's shareholders push back against all this speculative spending, which could have otherwise been used for dividends or share buybacks.While current AI spending may prove unsustainable in the long run, this challenge has yet to manifest itself in Nvidia's operational results. Third-quarter revenue jumped 94% to $35.1 billion based on massive demand for its high-end data center chips to train LLMs.Despite selling hardware, its gross margin of almost 75% rivals that of many software companies, helping operating income roughly double to $21.9 billion in the third quarter.Over the coming quarters, products based on Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU architecture promise to support continued growth and profitability. And so far, there is little evidence that the emergence of low-cost Chinese rival DeepSeek (which claims to have trained an industry-leading LLM on \"primitive\" H800 chips) is hurting demand for Nvidia's newest chips.Some industry experts argue that DeepSeek may have inappropriately copied technology from U.S. rivals like OpenAI through distillation  a process that involves transferring knowledge from a more advanced model to a smaller one. If true, this would suggest that Nvidia's cutting-edge GPUs still help create the most advanced LLMs, even if others later copy these models using cheaper chips.With a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of just 29, the stock is still surprisingly affordable, considering its incredible growth rate. For context, the Nasdaq-100 has an average forward P/E of 31 even though few, if any, of its members rival Nvidia's business expansion.That said, with a market cap of $3 trillion, it is hard to see Nvidia generating multibagger returns from here, especially considering that current AI hardware spending may begin to diminish over time.The stock's millionaire-maker days seem to be far behind it. And return-hungry investors should probably look for more under-the-radar ways to bet on the AI opportunity.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "A wave of Big Tech companies reported quarterly earnings in recent weeks  including six of the so-called Magnificent 7 firms  shortly after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled the stock market as investors saw its new, cheap artificial intelligence models as an ominous sign for US tech stocks.DeepSeeks innovations so shook the US tech industry that AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) saw $600 billion shaved off its market cap in a single day  the biggest loss in stock market history  as investors worried Big Tech would slow its spending on AI hardware.Now, some US lawmakers are pushing to ban the app from government-owned devices, according to the Wall Street Journal.On earnings calls with investors, executives across these firms were quick to praise DeepSeek's artificial intelligence models, dismissed them, or attempted to avoid the topic altogether.US tech executives reactions to the sell-off  which impacted most of their stocks  ranged from defensive to excited. While most agreed the DeepSeek news is a sign that AI costs will come down eventually, they reaffirmed their commitments to spending massive sums on capital expenditures and other investments for AI infrastructure in 2025, despite a lack of clarity about when the payoff for that spending will come.Here's what they said.Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella was quick to embrace DeepSeek, mentioning the firm in his opening remarks on a post-earnings call on Jan. 29.Nadella pointed to Microsoft's move to put DeepSeek's latest AI model on its developer platforms, Azure AI Foundry and GitHub, adding that it went through \"automated red teaming, content safety integration, and security scanning.\" He said customers will soon be able to run DeepSeek's models locally on Microsoft's AI PCs.\"I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations,\" Nadella said, adding that he sees AI getting \"commoditized.\"For a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned.Meta (META)  which one tech analyst recently described as the most well-placed company to take advantage of generative AI given its advertising business  saw its stock climb on DeepSeeks debut of its new AI model called R1, with shares rising nearly 2% on the day of the news.CEO Mark Zuckerberg was relatively nonchalant about the DeepSeek frenzy.When questioned on whether the potential for lower-cost AI models would affect Metas capital expenditures, the chief executive said in a call following the company's latest quarterly earnings: I don't know  it's probably too early to really have a strong opinion on what this means for the trajectory around infrastructure and capex and things like that.But DeepSeek is also competition for Meta, which has sought to make its open-source Llama AI models the global standard. DeepSeek's models are also open source.\"I also just think in light of some of the recent news, the new competitor, DeepSeek from China ... it's one of the things that we're talking about is there's going to be an open-source standard globally,\" Zuckerberg said.\"And I think for our kind of own national advantage, it's important that it's an American standard.\"Asked for his worldly perspective\" on \"the DeepSeek situation,\" Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook said in a post-earnings call Jan. 30 that innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing and noted that the iPhone maker takes a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure.Apple shares jumped more than 3% the same day DeepSeek released its latest R1 model.When asked about what DeepSeek's low-cost model means for Google (GOOG), CEO Sundar Pichai said that while DeepSeek's team has \"done very, very good work,\" he thinks Google's Gemini Flash models are better.\"I would say both our 2.0 Flash models, our 2.0 Flash thinking models, they are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1.\"\"And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full-stack development [Google makes its own custom AI chips as well as AI models and the software that runs on them], end-to-end optimization, our obsession with cost per query,\" Pichai added.\"I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is, we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible.\"Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy said he thinks that DeepSeeks models won't spark a downturn in AI investment.\"Sometimes people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference [running AI models], that somehow it's going to lead to less total spend in technology. And we have never seen that to be the case.\"Jassy pointed to the company's aggressive spending on developing its cloud infrastructure in the early 2000s, even as costs came down.He's right, at least for now.Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft said in their earnings calls that, despite the anticipation that artificial intelligence training and inference costs will come down, they will spend a cumulative $325 billion in 2025, a 46% increase from the prior year. Amazon is the biggest spender of the group.Investors weren't pleased: Amazon's stock dropped 4% Friday following executives' commentary that they expect to hike capital expenditures by 35% to more than $100 billion.AMD (AMD) CEO Lisa Su expressed her conviction that new innovations such as DeepSeeks models wont drive down investment in AI, pointing to the recently announced $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project backed by SoftBank (SFTBY), Oracle (ORCL), and OpenAI.All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses.\"Perhaps most enthused about DeepSeeks innovations was Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon, who made the case that such developments could speed up the timeline for AI to drive a new wave of demand for smartphones and PCs.\"DeepSeek-R1 and other similar models recently demonstrated the AI models are developing faster, becoming smaller, more capable and efficient and now able to run directly on device,\" Amon said.\"As we enter the era of AI inference, we expect that while training will continue in the cloud, inference will run increasingly on device, making AI more accessible, customizable, and efficient. This will encourage the development of more targeted, purpose-oriented models and applications, which we anticipate will drive increased adoption, and, in turn, demand for Qualcomm platforms across a range of devices.\"Arm (ARM) CEO Rene Haas also argued that the UK-based chip architecture designer would benefit from lower-cost AI for consumer devices, even taking a jab at Nvidia.As wonderful a product as [Nvidia's] Grace Blackwell is, you'd never be able to put it in a cell phone, you'd never be able to put it into earbuds.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) investors are navigating through an un-Nvidia-like start to the year.Shares of the AI chip darling are off by 1% this year, lagging all three major US indexes, which have notched gains. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) by over 5% in the past month.Ahead of Nvidia's results expected on Feb. 26, the Street has been out and about explaining the surprising weakness to clients and mostly defending the stock.In a note on Monday, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis pointed to three reasons for the weakness after talking with clients: 1) DeepSeek lowering AI demand in aggregate, 2) DeepSeek shifting AI compute cycles away from Nvidia GPUs and to ASICs [custom chips], and 3) Blackwell chip delays.Despite the concerns, Lipacis said he would be a buyer of the stock into Nvidia's earnings. The analyst reiterated an Outperform rating and a $190 price target.\"Nvidia remains the platform of choice for hyperscalers customers,\" Lipacis explained. \"The robustness of its software ecosystem and breadth of its development community put it 5-10 years ahead of anything else in the market. AMD and Amazon AWS ecosystems are a distant #2 and #3.\"The concerns about Nvidia aren't unfounded, however.China-based DeepSeek surprised markets in late January after unveiling RI, its AI model that it says gives a ChatGPT-esque performance at a cheaper price tag. RI cost a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Fears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia chips.Conventional wisdom all of last year was that training amazing models was going to be possible for only a handful of companies, Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. What DeepSeek has done over the past few weeks is shatter that belief by saying they can train a model for $6 million.This embedded content is not available in your region.Meanwhile, Amazon has announced an $8 billion partnership with Anthropic to enter the AI chip space, and Google (GOOG) has dropped a supercomputer with an AI chip called Willow. With those moves, it's evident Big Tech companies want in on Nvidia's hefty market share. What's more, Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell (MRVL) have released advanced custom chips.Watch: What Bill Gates thought of Steve JobsLipacis isn't alone in staying bullish on Nvidia going into earnings despite the less-than-favorable news flow this year. Bank of America's Vivek Arya reiterated the chipmaker as his top pick for 2025 last week.Arya has a $190 price target, which assumes about 57% upside from current trading levels. It's one of the highest price targets on Nvidia on the Street.\"The [earnings] call could mark the trough in investor sentiment as: 1) we expect Nvidia to reassure on Blackwell execution, 2) Signal confidence around fiscal year 2026/calendar year 2025 with 60%+ year over year growth in data center sales (still leaves headroom vs. Taiwan Semiconductor's call for AI to grow 100%+ year over year in calendar year 2025 end), and 3) create excitement ahead of flagship GTC Conf. (Mar 17) where focus shifts to solid pipeline (GB300, Rubin), and physical AI (robotics),\" Arya wrote in the note to clients.The Street hasn't baked sector worries into Nvidia's financial estimates just yet.Data from Yahoo Finance shows there have been five upward revisions to Nvidia's estimates for 2025 earnings over the past 30 days.

The tech sector is still recovering from the DeepSeek-driven sell-off last month, after investors panicked over fears of a cheaper open-source large language model.Opening Bid Podcast: how to trade the DeepSeek bombshellBut the development of DeepSeek should be viewed as a catalyst for the industry, not a headwind, according to top CEOs and industry experts. One former OpenAI employee told me the market should see DeepSeek developments as a win, given their potential to accelerate AI innovation and adoption.DeepSeeks R1 model is a breakthrough ... Being excited about progress in science is something that we should all want, and seeing the cost of a critical resource come down is also something we should want, explained Zack Kass, OpenAIs former head of Go-To-Market.And that sentiment has been echoed by Big Tech CEOs. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai described the companys work as tremendous on his firms earnings call earlier this week, while Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said there were a number of novel things that DeepSeek did that the company is still digesting.For investors looking to cash in on AIs next growth phase, it may be time to look beyond hyperscalers and chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD).The play: AI network stocks  the group that provides the infrastructure for AI applications.And heres why: As AI models like DeepSeeks R1 significantly increase compute demand, the need for high-speed networking solutions will only grow. Bank of Americas Chun Him Cheung wrote in a note to clients this week that a cheaper cost for compute should lead to wider AI-adoption and demand should be robust.T. Rowe Price Science and Technology equity strategy portfolio manager Tony Wang told me he sees the group as well positioned, while Stifels Ruben Roy also sees upside, citing DeepSeeks R1 model as a driver of global demand for robust and high-speed networking infrastructure.The networking aspect of it is definitely where theres a bottleneck in terms of delivering AI infrastructure, Wang told me. We're going to need to see a lot more innovation at that layer. Roy sees Ciena (CIEN), Coherent (COHR), and Celestica (CLS) as top beneficiaries as AI workloads get more efficient to run.The underlying plumbing for moving data is going to get more challenging to put into place... The interface speeds are moving higher, and the challenges of moving data around can continue to get more complex, Roy explained.He says Ciena is starting to see increased demand from hyperscalers as AI-related data bleeds out of the data centers and out into enterprises and consumers consuming AI. And Celestica, which builds switches and servers for hyperscalers, stands to gain as the industry moves into custom compute  the custom chips that hyperscalers are designing and developing.Morgan Stanley research analyst Meta Marshall is bullish on AI networking company Arista Networks (ANET).

        "content": "The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment.The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components  Meta  has notched double-digit gains out of the box.In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday  bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%.Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations.Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F).Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook.\"Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers,\" said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday.To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping  and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024.Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts.Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion.RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are \"crowded\" trades and that the \"AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue.\"The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech.The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust.\"While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance,\" explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson.A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Equity markets performed well in January, as they often do, but as the dust settles on that early-year run, the strategy for long-term investors remains the same: Invest in companies that can perform well over long periods, whether or not they moved in tandem with the market in January. One month of strong (or poor) returns means little in the grand scheme of things.To illustrate that point, let's discuss two stocks in the biotech industry that have moved in opposite directions so far this year: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA). Here's why these two companies could both produce outsized returns to patient investors.Vertex Pharmaceuticals is starting the year strong. On Jan. 30, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved Journavx, the first non-opioid oral pain signal inhibitor to earn the green light from regulators. Vertex's shares jumped on the news, and with good reason. Considering the devastation that opioids have caused in many communities in the U.S., a pain treatment that sidesteps the potential side effects of opioids fills a significant need.Further, Vertex now has medicines approved across pain, sickle cell disease (SCD), transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), and, of course, cystic fibrosis (CF), its core area of expertise. Vertex still generates most of its revenue from its CF franchise and still delivers excellent financial results. In the third quarter, the company's revenue increased by 12% year over year to $2.77 billion.In the next two years, sales from Vertex's newer medicines, including Journavx, its next-gen CF therapy Alyftrek, and Casgevy, which treats SCD and TDT, should ramp up significantly and help improve its already strong sales growth. Further, Vertex will likely make plenty of clinical progress, too. The company's late-stage pipeline includes inaxaplin, a potential therapy for APOL-1 mediated kidney disease, and povetacicept, an investigational therapy for Iga nephropathy (a chronic kidney disease).There are no approved treatments that target the underlying causes of both of these conditions. Vertex Pharmaceuticals has more candidates in early-stage studies. There is still plenty of upside left for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which makes it a top biotech stock to buy this month and hold onto for a while.Moderna is a victim of its own success. The biotech was fairly unknown in 2019, but rose to prominence in 2020 when it successfully developed a vaccine for COVID-19, a project in which most other companies of any size failed. Moderna made a small fortune thanks to this achievement, but its financial results and share price have been moving in the wrong direction for the better part of three years as the pandemic receded. Still, there are good reasons to expect the company to deliver strong returns over the long run.For one, Moderna demonstrated its innovative capabilities by quickly developing a COVID-19 vaccine when the world needed it most. The company's mRNA platform looks highly exciting, especially considering there are many infectious diseases for which there still aren't any vaccines, and those of the mRNA variety are faster to develop. That should grant Moderna an advantage as it seeks to create new products.The company has already earned approval for another one, mRESVIA, a vaccine for the respiratory syncytial virus. It also produced positive phase 3 results for its combination coronavirus/flu vaccine. Moderna's potential candidate for the cytomegalovirus is currently in phase 3 studies, as is its investigational personalized cancer vaccine that delivered excellent results in phase 2 clinical trials.This cancer vaccine, in combination with Merck's famous drug Keytruda, slashed the risk of recurrence or death in melanoma patients by 49% compared to Keytruda alone. Moderna has several other exciting candidates in phase 2 studies. Though the stock remains down, Moderna should record excellent pipeline and regulatory progress in the next few years, leading to stronger financial results. So, investors should strongly consider the stock this month while it is still struggling.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "source": "Investor's Business Daily",
        "content": "Investors looking to supercharge their portfolios often benefit from a broader stock search. One simple way to do that is to look at year-ahead earnings forecasts. Our picks for the seven best stocks for magnificent earnings growth include Renasant (RNST) and Kyndryl (KD)  stocks far less obvious than Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) or other megacaps that dominate the market.Artivion (AORT): The company makes medical devices and implantable human tissues used in cardiac and vascular surgical procedures. Analysts highlight the potential for significant growth from upcoming products. They predict Artivion will swing to earnings of one cent a share in 2024, from a net loss per share in each of the prior four years. In the year ahead, they project Artivion earnings will leap to 14 cents per share, a 1,560% increase, on 10% revenue growth. Artivion stock holds an IBD Composite Rating of 88 and RS Rating of 89, both out of a best-possible 99. The medical device maker has risen around 6.5% so far this year. Trading volume is relatively light. GE Vernova (GEV): The General Electric energy spinoff is seeing end markets recover. It has guided growth across business segments. Vernova is poised to benefit from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which consume vast amounts of energy. Wall Street expects Vernova earnings to surge 1,086% in the year ahead and to jump 64% next year, FactSet shows. GE Vernova stock flourishes a Composite Rating of 93 and RS Rating of 97. It is up 15% year to date. The fourth-quarter earnings report showed an improving wind business.TG Therapeutics (TGTX): A commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, TG sells a multiple sclerosis treatment called Briumvi, which has driven growth. On a per-share basis, analysts forecast TG will see a 783% surge in earnings  in the year ahead as sales surge 66%. It earns a spot on the best stocks for magnificent growth list after a recent turn to profits. TG Therapeutics stock shows a Composite Rating of 74 and RS Rating of 95. It has gained around 10% so far in 2025. EQT (EQT): A vertically integrated natural gas company, EQT focuses on the Appalachian basin. EQT has divested non-operating and midstream assets to focus on the core business plan, analysts say. Further, EQT may benefit from the new Donald Trump administration's more favorable stance toward fossil fuels. Analysts expect EQT earnings per share to more than double in the year ahead, surging 118% after a two-year slide, as sales recover 39%. EQT stock holds a Composite Rating of 78 and RS Rating of 92. It has leaped 16% higher year to date. Earnings are due on Feb. 18. Renasant (RNST): Founded in 1904, Renasant has banking and lending operations across southeastern states. Analysts forecast an 83% earnings jump in the year ahead as revenue grows 20%. The regional bank delivered an earnings gain for the fourth quarter of 2024 after three down quarters. A pending merger with The First bank in the first half of 2025 will accelerate growth and add to earnings, Renasant says, helping it join the best stocks list. Six analysts raised price targets after the Q4 report on Jan. 28, FactSet shows. No one cut. RNST stock holds a Composite Rating of 76 and RS Rating of 81. Year to date, Renasant stock has jumped almost 8%.Gilead Sciences (GILD): Another new entry to the best stocks list, the biopharmaceutical company's biggest moneymaker is an HIV treatment called Biktarvy. Gilead also makes Covid treatment Veklury. Analysts forecast Gilead earnings per share will soar 73% in the year ahead, reversing three years of declines. Sales growth is ticking up modestly, as well, after declines. Gilead stock shows a Composite Rating of 79 and RS Rating of 85. It is up 3.5% so far this year. Shares are well off May 2024 lows but remain well below all-time highs.Kyndryl (KD): Yet another new entry, the IT infrastructure services company was spun out of IBM (IBM) in 2021. Kyndryl says it is deliberately \"engineering a decline in revenue to get rid of low- or no-margin businesses\" and achieve profitable growth. Signings are growing and margins expanding due to demand from cloud hyperscalers, the company says. After Kyndryl raised outlook on Feb. 3, analysts now expect a 70% earnings jump in the year ahead as sales nudge up 0.5%. Kyndryl stock shows a Composite Rating of 93 and RS Rating of 96. It has rocketed 19.5% so far in 2025. A little background on IBD's process to select the best stocks for magnificent earnings growth:We began our screening process with the S&P Composite 1500 index, which aggregates the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 companies. We chose this index, in part, because it avoids less-liquid, lower-priced and lower-quality names, while efficiently measuring the total U.S. stock market.Then we limited the stocks on our best stock list to those showing FactSet consensus ratings of overweight or buy, which means analysts expect them to outperform industry peers. Next we further winnowed down the list, setting up a double hurdle: The stocks had to enjoy some of the strongest FactSet earnings growth estimates for the following fiscal year, while also earning solid IBD ratings, in terms of their Composite Rating and RS Rating.The resulting seven best stocks for outsize earnings growth are a quite different set from the Magnificent Seven stocks. At the same time, these stocks are worth watching as much as any of the Mag Seven stocks given their outperformance potential.To find other ideas for the best stocks to buy or watch, check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content."

        "content": "US stocks bounced back on Monday as investors looked beyond President Trump's latest tariff threats, including new levies on steel and aluminum imports.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added nearly 0.4% after the blue-chip index on Friday booked its worst loss in nearly four weeks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped nearly 1% as shares of AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) surged 3%, along with other tech stocks.Investors weighed Trump's recent pledge to introduce additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum from all countries, with the official announcement expected on Monday.The new metals tariffs are likely to benefit US steel companies, whose stock jumped. Shares in Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE) and US Steel (X) all jumped. Aluminum producer Alcoa's (AA) stock also gained.The move marks another escalation in Trump's fast-moving policy overhaul and in the odds of a trade war, after tariffs against US trade partners Canada and Mexico were paused last week.Meanwhile markets this week expect Trump to announce reciprocal tariffs on all trading partners that could match the duties levied on US products by each country.But Monday's gains for US stocks suggest that investors are getting used to Trump's trade salvos. Some on Wall Street say many now see the announcements as a negotiation tactic only.That said, markets are concerned the growing list of tariff hikes could drive up inflation, likely to stall interest rate cuts. The January Consumer Price Index reading due on Wednesday will be closely watched for clues, alongside the week's updates on retail sales.The latest New York Fed survey released on Monday showed consumers see long term inflation expectations ticking higher to 3%  the highest reading since May 2024.On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies are set to report earnings this week. McDonald's (MCD) shares rose after same-store sales grew, beating expectations. Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB) are set to follow this week.The major averages rebounded on Monday led by tech and energy stocks as investors awaited an official announcement from President Trump over new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained nearly 0.4% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rallied about 0.6%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied about 1% as most semiconductor stocks, including AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), surged.The markets brushed off President Trump's latest tariff threats. Over the weekend the president said he would introduce additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.Steel-related stocks jumped, including Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), Nucor (NUE) and US Steel (X).Meanwhile, Energy (XLE) stocks outperformed as oil prices rebounded from a three-week decline. Tech (XLK) stocks also outperformed.Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Shares of the server maker soared 15% on Monday ahead of a critical business update scheduled for Tuesday. This comes amid heightened investor scrutiny following recent financial accounting challenges. The company must file its overdue financial statements by Feb. 25 or face a potential delisting.Monday.com (MNDY)Shares of cloud platform monday.com surged by over 25% after the company posted fourth quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street revenue and profit expectations. The firm's executives signaled plans to intensify artificial intelligence efforts in 2025 on the heels of the report.Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF)Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) soared 15% after President Trump said over the weekend that he would impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the US. Peers US Steel (X), Alcoa (AA), and Nucor (NUE) all gained during Monday's session.Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:Billionaire Elon Musk suggested in a series of social media posts this past weekend that the Federal Reserve should undergo closer scrutiny, making the comments just days before Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill.Musk  who is already roiling Washington as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)  said in one post on X Sunday that \"All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people. No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve.\"It came in reaction to a post from another X user who argued that the Fed has never had a full audit or a full disclosure of monetary policy decisions.Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports:The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment.The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components  Meta  has notched double-digit gains out of the box.In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday  bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%.Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations.Read more here. Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rallied more than 3% on Monday as Wall Street analysts remain bullish on the stock, despite last month's sell-off over the creation of a Chinese AI model seen as a threat to its US rivals.Nvidia stock is currently flat for the year, following several volatile weeks.On Monday Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated an Outperform rating and a $190 price target on the stock, ahead of the company's earnings report on Feb. 26.Also on Monday, Argus reiterated its Buy rating on Nvidia with a $175 price target, despite the release of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI model, which sparked a tech sell-off in late January.\"Competition in AI will continue to intensify, but beyond data center, Nvidia also has huge growth opportunities in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive,\" wrote Argus senior analyst James Kelleher.Meanwhile, Bank of America's Vivek Arya also reaffirmed the chip giant as his top pick for 2025 last week.Shares of Nvidia rose on Monday after the company's main supplier for AI servers, Hon Hai Precision Industry, reported a 3% bump in January sales and strengthened its quarterly revenue forecast.Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:Rivian (RIVN) announced on Monday that it is opening up orders for its Rivian Commercial van beyond its initial launch partners, potentially creating a lucrative business for the pure-play EV maker.Rivians commercial van runs on the same platform as the current electric delivery van that Rivian produces for Amazon (AMZN). Though Rivian originally had an exclusive arrangement to produce 100,000 vans for the retail giant, Amazon is currently only using 20,000 vans.Rivian said that after the end of its exclusivity period with Amazon, it had been testing its commercial vans with large fleet operators, including AT&T, and was now ready to open up orders to other companies utilizing fleets.Rivian shares were up over 3% in midday trade on Monday.Oil futures rallied on Monday, helping lift energy stocks.The S&P 500 Energy Sector (XLE) was the biggest gainer, outperforming Tech (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY).On Monday the stock market shrugged off escalating trade tensions, with all three major averages rallying.Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) and Brent futures (BZ=F) gained more than 1%, bouncing back from a three-week decline.\"The sharply higher US stock market is also bringing buyers back from the sidelines,\" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading for BOK Financial Securities.US consumers' long-term inflation expectations moved higher in January as President Trump teased more tariff announcements over the weekend.According to the latest survey released by the New York Federal Reserve Monday morning, consumers see inflation steady at 3% a year from now, while the three-year period also came in unchanged at 3%. Five-year inflation expectations, however, ticked up to 3% from the prior 2.7% reading  the highest since May 2024.Year-ahead commodity price expectations rose across the board, with the outlook for gas prices rising to 2.6% in January while costs for food, medical care, college, and rent all increased to 4.6%, 6.8%, 5.9%, and 6.0%, respectively.The results follow last week's University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which showed headline sentiment decline to its lowest level in seven months. Pessimism over the inflation outlook drove down February's preliminary read and one-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% from 3.3% last month.Outside of inflation, Monday's survey also pointed to some uncertainty within the US job market, despite Friday's hot January payrolls report. The mean perceived probability of losing ones job in the next 12 months increased by 2.3 percentage points to 14.2% in January. Meanwhile, the mean perceived probability of finding a job in the next three months also increased to 51.5%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points.Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports:Markets may be trying to figure out the impact of a full-on Trump trade war with Europe, China, Canada, and Mexico.But one prominent economist says the eventual outcome could be singular.Apollo Global Management (APO) chief economist Torsten Slk told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid that a full-scale US trade war against the world would deliver a \"stagflationary shock\" to the US economy. Stagflation is defined as a period of slow growth and high inflation. It's a tariff-related warning also recently issued by billionaire investor Ray Dalio. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\"So the short-run effects of a trade war [are] certainly painful. Even this might be small numbers, but it's certainly something that's negative,\" Slk said on Monday (see video above; listen below).Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:Donald Trump's rapid reorientation of the US trade landscape has a busy week ahead, and he could make moves on three simultaneous fronts as importers, CEOs, and foreign leaders struggle to adjust.The uncertainty is being heightened as crucial details remain unclear, but with the president promising \"highly detailed\" announcements in the days ahead.Up first this week is a newly announced plan for 25% duties on steel and aluminum, which Trump told reporters on Sunday would be announced on Monday.The president is set to sign new executive orders at 1 p.m. ET. He said his tariff plans will apply to all imports, but it remains to be seen how these new duties overlap with existing metal tariffs.Read more here. The headline is the whole story, give or take.At midnight Saturday, this post on X emerged:As Sherwood's Luke Kawa notes: \"Saylor runs Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin. The warm market response to Cohens tweet suggests that traders are hoping that Cohen uses some of GameStops $4.6 billion in cash and cash-like securities to take a page from Saylors playbook. (That playbook has one rule: buy bitcoin).\"Here's GameStop stock (GME) this morning, up as much as 7% about 30 minutes into the trading session:Back in December 2023, GameStop's board gave Cohen the authority to use the company's capital to make investments, essentially laying the groundwork for GameStop to be turned into a holding company similar to the Daily Journal (DJCO) company formerly chaired by the late Charlie Munger, or, more grandiosely, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A).Saylor's Strategy, as Kawa notes, last week formally changed its branding and corporate goals around serving as a bitcoin holding company. (The company also has a small software business on the side.)Longtime analyst Jeff Macke told Yahoo Finance last year he thinks GameStop should follow the same path.And you know what they say about pictures.Gold surged on Monday to trade past $2,900 to hit new records as President Trump's latest tariff threats spurred the buying of the safe-haven asset.Gold futures (GC=F) climbed more than 1.4% to around $2,930 after hitting a series of all-time highs in the past week.Over the weekend, Trump said that he will introduce 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum into the US from all countries, on top of existing duties.He also said Friday he plans to announce retaliatory tariffs this week to match the levies that countries impose on US goods. The latest policy shifts follow 10% tariffs on certain Chinese products, which went into effect on Tuesday.Wall Street analysts have stayed bullish on gold amid the growing tariff threats.\"We continue to see gold as an effective portfolio hedge and diversifier, and believe an allocation of around 5% within a USD balanced portfolio is optimal,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a Monday note.Gold is up almost 10% this year so far, following a 27% rally in 2024.US stocks opened higher on Monday with Industrials getting a lift as investors anticipate US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will be announced soon.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 0.6% after the blue-chip index on Friday booked its worst loss in nearly four weeks. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped 0.7%.On Sunday, President Donald Trump said he will impose new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with an announcement expected on Monday. Also, investors expect Trump to announce a retaliatory tariff plan this week.Trade tensions have prompted investors to flock to safe-haven assets like gold. The precious metal gained more than 1% on Monday, to trade above $2,900 per ounce for the first time on record.The year-to-date gain for gold is almost 10%, following a 27% rally in 2024.Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (January)Earnings: McDonald's (MCD), Monday.com (MNDY)Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning:Investors await inflation data amid tariff concerns: The week aheadTrump says he'll announce 25% steel and aluminum tariffs on MondayTrump 2.0 requires a new playbook for stock investorsTSMC dampens outlook on quake loss as AI concerns persistTrump tariff plan on steel, aluminum lifts shares of US producersDeepSeek fuels hope for China tech megacap revivalGold rises to record high as tariffs spur haven buyingTrump says US might have less debt than thought"

        "content": "The S&P 500 is up 69% since bottoming in 2022, but the stocks of some industry-leading companies are still trading in the bargain bin.The following companies were flying high along with the broad market just a few years ago, yet their share prices have yet to recover and remain at multiyear lows. Here's why these beaten-down stocks can rebound in 2025.The sluggish post-pandemic economy in China has weighed on sales for Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA), which is home to the popular e-commerce marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall. The company generates revenue from its e-commerce operations and also a logistics operation, cloud computing division, and entertainment segment, among others. But after regularly delivering high double-digit top line growth for years, it began reporting declining revenue in 2022. Growth has rebounded somewhat with revenue increasing 5% year over year in Q3 2024.Fortunately, China's e-commerce market is expected to climb 47% to $1.7 trillion in the next three years, according to Statista. The Chinese government has also taken several measures to boost its economy in recent months, which should begin having an effect on the region in 2025. As China's largest e-commerce and cloud services provider, Alibaba should be among the chief beneficiaries.While Alibaba is already the market leader there, it's also seeing success overseas where revenue from international commerce grew 35% year over year in the most recent quarter, driven by strong gains from the AliExpress and Trendyol platforms. Alibaba Cloud also appears to be in a solid position after reporting triple-digit growth for artificial intelligence-related products last quarter.Alibaba remains a large and profitable company, and it generated $12 billion in trailing-12-month net income on $134 billion of revenue. With the stock trading at just 11 times this year's earnings estimate, investors are getting a bargain that could deliver handsome gains in 2025 and beyond.The U.S. housing market has been hobbled by rising interest rates, but as borrowing rates stabilize, housing activity is starting to pick up again, which could be great news for the leading online home goods seller, Wayfair (NYSE: W).The company was averaging around 40% annual revenue growth until demand for home goods collapsed along with the housing market. Wayfair's revenue plummeted, but sales trends are stabilizing. In the most recent quarter, the company posted a revenue decline of just 2% from the year-ago quarter, which still reflects a weak home spending environment but shows the company is on the verge of returning to growth.The business is in a better financial position, too. Management has been making decisions that are improving its cash flow. For example, it recently exited Germany in order to focus on more favorable growth prospects in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Ireland. Wayfair returned to positive free cash flow last year, positioning the business for profitable long-term growth.While Wayfair lost a small number of active customers last year, it still has a large customer base of more than 21 million. Moreover, these customers spent slightly more on goods in Q3 with average order value increasing 4.4% year over year to $310.These positive trends are pointing to a strong rebound for the business as the housing market recovers. The stock's price-to-sales multiple has settled around 0.5 over the last two years. In a growing home goods market, the stock offers significant upside for investors.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has performed remarkably well in recent years, soaring by around 23% in 2024 alone and by more than 80% over the past five years.But as strong as those figures are, plenty of stocks and funds have crushed the S&P 500 lately.There's no way to know for certain how the market will perform in 2025, and higher-risk, higher-reward types of investments can often experience increased volatility in the short term. But there's one powerhouse Vanguard ETF that has outpaced the S&P 500 in recent years, and there's reason to believe it might continue that trend this year.The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT) is a fund solely dedicated to tech stocks. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are the three most heavily weighted stocks in this ETF, making up a combined 44.94% of the entire fund. The top 10 holdings overall comprise close to 60% of the entire ETF, with the remaining 306 stocks rounding out the other 40%.An ETF that's so heavily weighted toward a handful of stocks can be both a risk and an advantage. On one hand, it offers much less diversification than an ETF that's more evenly spread across a wide variety of stocks from multiple industries  increasing risk. That said, if these stocks continue their winning streak, you could see serious returns.Many of this ETF's top holdings are heavily focused on advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia, for example, is a key supplier of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used by many AI developers.With AI exploding in recent years, stocks with a heavy focus on the technology have surged along with them. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has earned total returns of close to 74% over the last two years, compared to the S&P 500's total returns of 48% in that time.But it's not just recent developments in tech that have propelled this fund further. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has a long history of earning above-average returns, with an average return of more than 13% per year since its inception in 2004  higher than the market's historic average of around 10% per year.While there are no guarantees that big tech stocks will continue thriving in the coming years, this ETF has a decades-long history of outperforming the market.Late last month, Nvidia experienced a historic fall after the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot that could pose a competitive threat to other companies heavily centered around AI technology. The sharp decline made history as the largest single-day sell-off for an individual stock in U.S. market history.While many investors are not overly concerned about DeepSeek or its role in Nvidia's future, the sell-off highlights the risk of investing in emerging technologies. While it can fuel supercharged earnings, the downturns can also be brutal.Before you invest in any ETF, it's wise to weigh the risks versus the rewards. This is especially true when buying tech funds, as there are more risks to consider. New competitors can pop up quickly, and if your investment is heavily focused on a few stocks, you could see significant volatility if those stocks can't keep up with industry trends.The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has a long history of beating the S&P 500, and if AI continues its dominance in the tech sector, this fund could be poised for even more growth. Just consider your risk tolerance before you buy, and double-check that the rest of your portfolio is well-diversified to protect your money as much as possible.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "source": "Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Robby Starbuck, who built a social media following by criticizing companies for their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, has set JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in his sights.\"JPMorgan ... they are going to end up being a target for us,\" the conservative Latino activist told Yahoo Finance.Starbuck called the banks methods for training its adult employees on gender identity embarrassing and ludicrous and accused it of using illegal quotas to hire apprentices and analysts.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon sounds ready for a fight. \"Bring them on,\" Dimon said of activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC in Davos.When asked specifically about Starbuck's intentions, a JPM spokesperson referred Yahoo Finance to Dimons CNBC interview and his April 2024 shareholder letter, in which Dimon stood by JPMorgan's DEI initiatives and said that JPMorgan would \"scour\" its DEI programs, words, and actions to make sure all comply with evolving laws.The nation's largest bank is not the first big American company that Starbuck has targeted.Starbuck has amassed nearly 770,000 followers on X and is part of a broader cultural force credited with helping to motivate companies like Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Deere (DE) to abandon some of their DEI efforts in what has now become a political flash point.We realized the best place to start was start with the companies that had largely right-wing demographics that were consumers, and then slowly inch our way into what we call 'jump ball' companies, which are kind of like anybodys game, Starbuck said.Companies in a variety of industries have backpedaled over the past year from DEI policies that they once championed, and these policies now come under increasing criticism in the nations capital.President Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to combat illegal private sector DEI actions.The non-government Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, reported on in late January that it canceled roughly $1 billion in federal contracts geared toward diversity.Late last month, the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration had placed nearly 60 Veterans Affairs workers on paid leave whose jobs were focused on diversity.Starbuck is also not the only activist pushing companies to retreat from DEI.The National Center for Public Policy Research, the National Legal and Policy Center, and the Heritage Foundation have submitted shareholder proposals seeking changes or deeper examinations of practices at several big banks.NCPPR and NLPC submitted anti-DEI proposals to Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase, while Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got proposals from NLPC and Heritage asking for audits of how the banks treat customers with certain political beliefs.Over the past year, a range of companies from other industries have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowes (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came last Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.Not all companies have changed course.For example, Costco (COST) urged its investors to vote against a shareholder proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its DEI practices. The measure was defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.And JPMorgan is not the only big lender holding firm on its DEI stance for now.The CEO of Goldman Sachs in January said he would continue to focus on efforts to promote DEI, and the CEO of Deutsche Bank (DB) made the same point, calling DEI programs an \"integral\" part of the firm's strategy.\"We are now firmly behind this program,\" Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing said on Jan. 30. \"We can see how Deutsche Bank has benefited from it.\"For his part, Starbuck aims to continue the battle, pushing into an ever-widening group of companies across various industries and sectors.Starbuck said the DEI programs he targets work against the financial interests of the company and company shareholders and that company executives promoting them are breaching their fiduciary duties to make money.At the end of the day, if you see the evidence that this is not making you money, or this is wasting you money, then you should get away from it.\"He told Yahoo Finance he has a \"copious amount\" of evidence about JPMorgan's DEI policies.But Dimon said in his 2024 shareholder letter that JPMorgans management team believes that its DEI policies enhance business, the general economic well-being of communities and countries, and long-term shareholder value.The banks DEI initiatives include a nearly completed five-year, $30 billion commitment to help Black, Hispanic, Latino, and other underserved communities obtain grants and loans for housing, small businesses, and supplier diversity.Dimon said in the letter that, going forward, JPMorgan planned to embed the programs into its \"business-as-usual operating system.\"David Hollerith contributed to this article.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock pricesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "Collectively, about 6,000 companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Exchange, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). Many of those companies are grouped into major indexes that measure various aspects the domestic market.However, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is generally considered the best barometer for the overall U.S. stock market due to its scope and diversity. Read on to see the S&P 500's average return over the last decade, and to learn what Wall Street expects in the future.The S&P 500 was created in 1957, though its precursor was introduced in the 1920s. The index measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies that cover approximately 80% of domestic equities and 50% of global equities by market capitalization. It includes stocks from all 11 market sectors, though it is most heavily weighted toward the technology sector.Companies must meet specific requirements to be eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500, such as GAAP profitability and a minimum market value of $20.5 billion. The index is rebalanced quarterly, typically on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. The 10 largest holding are listed by weight below:Apple: 6.9%Microsoft: 6%Nvidia: 5.7%Amazon: 4.3%Alphabet: 4.2%Meta Platforms: 2.9%Tesla: 2.2%Broadcom: 2%Berkshire Hathaway: 1.6%JPMorgan Chase: 1.4%Excluding dividends, the S&P 500 advanced 192% during the last decade, compounding at 11.2% annually. If dividends are included, the S&P 500 achieved a total return of 249% over that period, compounding at 13.3% annually. That period covers a broad range of economic and market environments, so similar returns are possible over the next decade.However, the S&P 500 currently trades at 22.2 times forward earnings, a material premium to the 10-year average of 18.3 times forward earnings. Unfortunately, such a high valuation hints at worse returns in the future. Historically, a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22 has correlated with annualized returns between negative 2% and positive 2% over the next decade, according to JPMorgan Chase.Having said that, every situation is unique, which means past performance is never a guarantee of future results. So, let's look at what certain Wall Street firms expect in the coming years.In the coming years, most Wall Street analysts agree that artificial intelligence will be an important tailwind, and they expect elevated valuations to be a headwind. Even so, analysts interpret those variable differently, such that forecasts range from extremely bearish to extremely bullish. Detailed below are the long-term outlooks from five Wall Street firms:Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 to achieve a total return of 3% annually through 2034 as historically expensive valuations and unusually high concentration  the 10 largest stocks account for about 37% of the index  drag on the market.JPMorgan Chase estimates the S&P 500 will achieve a total return of 6.7% annually over the next 10 to 15 years as productivity gains from AI are offset to some degree by currently elevated valuations.Morgan Stanley thinks the S&P 500 will trade sideways in the coming decade. \"Given where valuations are today, over the next 10 years, the returns from point A to point B will be basically flat-ish, on a real basis, maybe negative,\" according to CIO Mike Wilson.Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisor estimates the S&P 500 will reach 15,000 by 2030 as the global labor shortage boosts AI stocks and millennials (the largest generation) reshapes the economy. His forecast implies annual returns of 20% over the next five years.Yardeni Research believes the S&P 500 will reach 10,000 by 2030 as AI drives productivity and boosts profit margins. That forecast implies annual returns of 10.3% over the next five years.Outlooks concerning the U.S. stock market vary widely among Wall Street analysts, which illustrates an important point: It is impossible to consistently predict the performance of the S&P 500.So, the most prudent strategy is to buy good stocks (those with earnings likely to be much higher in the future) and hold them for as long as the investment thesis remains sound. Investors who follow that strategy over the next decade will likely turn a satisfying profit, regardless of what the S&P 500 does.Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and S&P 500 Index wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The latest inflation data wasn't what the market wanted to see. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5% month over month in January, and 3% year over year. That was higher than expected -- the consensus had been for a 0.3% monthly rise and a 2.9% annual pace -- and well above the Federal Reserve's stated target of around 2%. Meanwhile, another inflation gauge, the Producer Price Index (PPI), rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.4% rate last month, which was higher than the 0.3% increase economists expected. Hotter-than-expected inflation is bad news for consumers and borrowers. It will likely prevent the Federal Reserve from making more reductions to its benchmark interest rate anytime soon. However, some companies stand to benefit from inflation. Two notable beneficiaries are W. P. Carey (NYSE: WPC) and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP). Higher inflation should enable them to grow their cash flows faster in the future, which could support higher growth rates in their high-yielding dividends. W. P. Carey is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns a diversified portfolio of high-quality, operationally critical properties. It focuses on single-tenant industrial, warehouse, and retail properties across North America and Europe, secured by long-term net leases with built-in rent escalators. Net leases require that tenants cover most of the operating expenses of the properties they occupy, including building insurance, real estate taxes, and routine maintenance. That tends to insulate the REIT from the impacts of inflation. Meanwhile, W. P. Carey benefits from inflation thanks to those lease escalator clauses. Roughly 51% of its leases link tenants' rents to the CPI. Because of that, its rents grow faster during periods of elevated inflation. Last year, its same-store rent growth was above 2.6%, thanks to inflation. W. P. Carey has also been focusing on investing in properties that benefit from inflation. It sold off its portfolio of office properties last year, which gave it the cash to invest in new properties. Many of its latest investments feature leases with inflation-linked rents. For example, it invested $191 million into a 19-property industrial and warehouse portfolio across the U.S. and Canada. The properties had a weighted average remaining lease term of 13 years. Rents on the U.S. properties will rise in sync with U.S. CPI, while the Canadian rents will escalate at a fixed rate. The company also bought several properties in Poland last year; their rents will escalate at a rate tied to the Eurozone's CPI. The REIT's strategy of linking rents to inflation should enable it to continue delivering above-average rent growth compared to its net lease peers, which generally ink leases with fixed annual rent increases. That positions W. P. Carey to continue increasing its dividend, which currently yields 6.1%, and which could grow faster than the payouts of its peers if inflation remains high. Brookfield Infrastructure is a global infrastructure operator with investments across the utility, energy midstream, transportation, and data sectors. Those businesses produce stable cash flows. About 85% of its funds from operations (FFO) come from contracted or regulated assets. Most of the company's financial frameworks benefit from inflation. About 70% of its FFO comes from assets that index the rates they charge to inflation. Meanwhile, the contracts for another 15% of its FFO have mechanisms that protect them from inflation. This indexation to inflation provides Brookfield Infrastructure with stable and growing cash flows. The company estimates that inflation alone will add between 3% and 4% to its FFO per share each year. That helps support high organic growth rates. For example, Brookfield delivered 7% organic FFO growth last year, driven by elevated inflation, stronger volumes, and recently completed capital projects. The company noted that high inflation allowed it to push through strong tariff (fee) increases in its transportation portfolio (7% across its rail network and 6% across its toll road portfolio). Inflation should help drive additional growth for Brookfield in the coming years. Management believes that its growth drivers (which include inflation) can help power more than 10% annual FFO per share growth. That should support 5% to 9% annual increases in the company's dividend, which at the current share price yields more than 4%. W. P. Carey and Brookfield Infrastructure benefit from elevated inflation rates because many of their contracts feature inflation escalation clauses. That's helping drive additional earnings growth for these companies. This growth should flow down to their dividends, which they expect to continue increasing. Because of that, they're great stocks to buy for those who want to cash in on inflation. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Percentages as of Feb. 11.Having 10 stocks account for over half of an ETF's holdings doesn't quite scream diversification, but it's true for many market-cap-weighted ETFs because of skyrocketing big tech valuations.The bad news is that the performance of these companies will heavily influence the ETF's success (or lack thereof). The good news is that these companies have been some of the top-performing stocks over the past decade. In this case, the worst-performing stock of the bunch at that time is Alphabet's class C stock, and it's up over 570%. Not too shabby.Big tech has been off to a shaky start in 2025, but that shouldn't be an indictment of its long-term growth potential. Many valuations have admittedly been inflated because of hype fueled by artificial intelligence (AI), but a handful of industries are still on the early side of what they could (and should) become.With cloud computing, cybersecurity, AI-driven productivity, and semiconductors, the runway for these top holdings is far from over. The key is to stay focused on the long term and become reactive to short-term happenings in the market.The S&P 500 -- which tracks the 500 largest U.S. companies on the market -- is the most important index on the U.S. stock market, and it's honestly not even close.Most stocks and ETFs compare their performance against the S&P 500's to determine whether they are overperforming or underperforming. In this ETF's case, it's the former.To give you an idea of how lucrative the ETF can be, let's see how a $2,000 investment 20 years ago would fare today.Now, past results don't guarantee future performance, and there's no way to know how the ETF will perform, but you can see how resilient the ETF can be in the long run -- which is what you should be focusing on.Even if we assume the ETF grows a more modest 10% annually, a $2,000 investment today could be worth close to $5,100 in 10 years and close to $13,000 in 20 years (accounting for the ETF's 0.20% expense ratio).If you have reservations about investing the full $2,000 at once, you can take the dollar-cost-averaging approach and break down your investments into smaller installments. You could make two $1,000 investments, four $500 investments, five $400 investments, or whatever you are most comfortable with.Using dollar-cost averaging could help shield you against sudden drops in the market and reduce the impact of volatility.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then youll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If youre worried youve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before its too late.

        "content": "Most dividend stocks make quarterly payments. That can make it more challenging for those seeking to align their income with their monthly expenses. You'd need to do a bit more work to build a portfolio of companies with staggered dividend payment schedules so that you can generate enough income each month to help cover some of your expenses. However, some companies make it easy to align your income with your expenses by paying monthly dividends. Realty Income (NYSE: O) and Agree Realty (NYSE: ADC) are two of the best monthly dividend stocks. They also pay high-yielding dividends, which allows investors to generate more income each month.Realty Income also goes by the name The Monthly Dividend Company. It has certainly been that over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has declared 655 consecutive monthly dividends throughout its history. It has raised its dividend 128 times since its public market listing in 1994, including for the past 109 quarters in a row. The REIT has grown its payout at a 4.2% compound annual rate over the past 30 years. Its dividend currently yields 5.8%, which is well above the S&P 500's 1.2% yield. At that rate, every $100 invested in the REIT could produce $5.80 of dividend income each year, compared with just $1.20 if invested in an S&P 500 index fund. The REIT owns a diversified portfolio of net lease properties. Those leases provide very stable rental income because tenants cover all operating expenses, including routine maintenance, building insurance, and real estate taxes. It currently owns over 15,450 properties leased to more than 1,550 clients in 90 industries across the U.S. and Europe. It gets 79.4% of its rent from retail tenants, 14.4% from industrial properties, 3.2% from gaming facilities, and 2.9% from other properties, including data centers. Realty Income has steadily expanded its portfolio over the years. It buys properties in sale-leaseback transactions with owner-operators, acquires portfolios from investors, merges with other REITs, and invests in build-to-suit projects. Last year, it closed its $9.3 billion merger with fellow REIT Spirit Realty and invested more than $3.5 billion into other property investments. The REIT has a strong financial profile, which gives it lots of flexibility to continue making acquisitions. It also recently launched a private market fund management platform to tap into a large source of acquisition funding. Future acquisitions should grow its rental income, enabling it to continue increasing its high-yielding monthly dividend. Agree Realty switched to a monthly dividend schedule a few years ago. It has grown its payout at a healthy 5.6% compound annual rate over the past decade. Its dividend currently yields 4.3%. The REIT has a much more focused investment strategy. It invests only in retail properties secured by net leases (81.1% of its annual base rent) or ground leases (10.9%), such as grocery stores, home improvement centers, and tire and auto service locations. Those lease structures deliver very stable rental income. The REIT also focuses on owning properties leased to financially strong retailers, which adds to its income stability: 68.2% of its rent comes from investment-grade tenants. Agree Realty typically buys retail properties from existing and new partners in sale-leaseback transactions. Last year, it invested $866.6 million into acquiring 242 retail net lease properties. It also had 41 development projects that it either completed last year or are currently under construction for a total projected cost of $179.9 million. These investments helped grow its portfolio to 2,370 properties and increased its adjusted funds from operations by 4.6% last year, which supported a 2.8% raise in its monthly dividend. The REIT has a strong financial profile. That supports its view that it can invest another $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion into new retail properties this year. It has a very long growth runway. Its retail partners currently own more than 169,000 locations, which the REIT could acquire in the future. Realty Income and Agree Realty are great dividend stocks to buy for those seeking a monthly payout. Because both offer high-yielding dividends backed by high-quality real estate portfolios and strong financial profiles, these REITs should be able to continue growing their portfolios and monthly payouts in the coming years, which should help their investors cover their rising monthly expenses.

        "content": "By Summer Zhen and Jiaxing LiHONG KONG (Reuters) - China's apparent breakthrough in AI and rapprochement with tech giants has sent Hong Kong stocks and internet giants soaring, but the buyers behind it are flighty and brokers say global investors are wary of big bets while markets swing wildly.Hong Kong's Hang Seng has roared back from a run of lean years to vie with Germany's DAX as the world's best-performing market for the year so far, with gains of 13% and 13.1% respectively, against a 4% rise for the S&P500.Hong Kong tech shares have surged 31% since the middle of January to hit three-year highs on Monday, while President Xi Jinping sat down with top tech leaders in Beijing.Prices gyrating as investors scoured pictures and footage of the meeting for the faces of top bosses neatly underscored the fevered speculation and the degree of hope behind the rally.Trading also illustrated what has become an adage of investing in China in recent years, that the biggest prize goes to the earliest movers, especially if they can get out as soon as the euphoria begins to fade.\"As with moves in the past two years or so in HK/China, it's very retail driven (and volatile) - a trading market,\" said Wong Kok Hoong, head of equity sales trading at Maybank.\"Hedge funds or the more Hong Kong-China centric funds are well aware of the dangers of not rushing in from the onset.\"Data from brokers seems to show that is exactly who is buying.CICC estimates that cumulative southbound flows - that is, buying by mainland investors - have reached HK$26.6 billion ($3.4 billion) since the Lunar New Year holiday in early February, on par with a record-breaking rush in September.A Morgan Stanley note on hedge fund positioning showed net exposures near their highest in a year, with buyers mostly in Asia and taking long positions, rather than covering short bets.\"Hot money is driving the market for the past two weeks,\" said Steven Leung, who handles institutional clients at brokerage UOB KayHian in Hong Kong, referring to funds controlled by investors seeking short-term returns.EARLY BELIEVERSThe rally's triggers include the sudden popularity of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has developed an AI model far cheaper than U.S. rivals, relief that China has not been hit with big U.S. sanctions, and the sight of Xi meeting with tech leaders.Shares in Alibaba have headlined the rally on news of an AI partnership with Apple along with the appearance of founder Jack Ma, who has kept a low profile over years of crackdowns on China's tech giants, at this week's symposium with Xi Jinping.The stock touched a three-year high on Monday and is up nearly 50% for the year so far.The volume of Alibaba shares traded in Hong Kong last week was the largest since listing in late 2019 and weekly volume for its U.S.-listed ADR was the highest for two years.\"(Jack Ma's) presence would be hugely symbolic of how the government's stance towards the tech sector has changed,\" said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong.\"If there's one person associated with the tech crackdown, it's Jack Ma...it's more or less a total reversal of the policy stance from a few years ago, when officials vowed to curb the 'disorderly' expansion of capital.\"To be sure, Morgan Stanley said in a note last week that global investors were starting to reassess China's investability, after a long period of limited attention, though it added that as of late January they had been underweight.On Monday, Goldman Sachs analysts raised forecasts for the MSCI China index to 85 from 75 and there are investors who see a sustainable rally.Still, for many the lesson from disappointments after rallies on China's post-COVID reopening and pledges of stimulus in September has been to move fast and think short-term.Maybank's Wong said that amongst themselves, retail investors in China say: \"The early believers get to eat the chicken; the subsequent ones get to drink the chicken soup; and the late true believers will have to take over the empty plates.\"($1 = 7.7807 Hong Kong dollars)(Reporting by Summer Zhen and Jiaxing Li in Hong Kong.

        "content": "After a huge run higher, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock hasn't even been keeping up with the overall market in recent months. There are several reasons for that, but the big question for investors is whether it's now time to take advantage of Nvidia's stagnant share price.The stock soared about 85% over the last year, yet it is lower than it was four months ago, even as the S&P 500 has a total return of about 4% in that time. But now it looks like there are over 300 billion more reasons to buy the stock. That's because several big tech companies plan to spend as much as $320 billion on data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure over the next year.Nvidia's recent success is relatively easy to explain. Its advanced AI graphics processing unit (GPU) chips are in high demand. Using management's guidance for its soon-to-be-reported fiscal fourth quarter, revenue for the fiscal year ended in late January should show year-over-year growth of about 110%. That's especially impressive considering quarterly revenue is approaching $40 billion.Nvidia also shared its plans with investors for continued innovation that should keep driving demand. Sales of its H100 and H200 GPU chips have been boosting revenue growth, and Nvidia now has its Blackwell AI architecture in production.CEO Jensen Huang has called demand for Blackwell \"insane.\" Investors will hear an update on its Blackwell sales when Nvidia reports earnings on Feb. 26. The company might also discuss the next-generation Rubin AI platform that is due in 2026.One recent headwind for Nvidia stock was the surprising announcement last month from privately owned Chinese start-up DeepSeek. That company reportedly created a high-performing large language model (LLM) for just $6 million. While many question the authenticity of that total capital cost, the DeepSeek product raised uncertainty about how much large-cap tech companies would continue to spend on Nvidia AI products.But those companies aren't throttling back on spending. Meta Platforms, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft each announced spending plans for data centers and AI infrastructure in 2025. As a group, the investments could total as much as $320 billion over the course of just one year.Amazon expects to lead the way with $100 billion in capital expenditure. CEO Andy Jassy stated, \"The vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS (Amazon Web Services).\" Alphabet plans about $75 billion and Meta $65 billion. Microsoft will continue on its plan for $80 billion in AI investments through June of this year.That company said it is already seeing returns on its investment. Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, noted, \"Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year over year.\" Nvidia is the clear leader in hardware for AI infrastructure and is arguably the biggest benefactor from all that capital spending.On top of those tailwinds related to AI data center spending, Nvidia has other growing segments. Its gaming business generates the second most revenue. Gaming revenue has accelerated in each of the last three quarters, reaching its highest level since Nvidia's quarterly period ended May 1, 2022.Its professional visualization business provides a platform for creating industrial AI simulations and uses AI to drive efficiencies for industrial developers. That segment's revenue has increased in each of the past three quarters and has more than doubled in the last two years. Automotive and robotics revenue has also accelerated, with growth in each of the last five quarterly periods.Those other business segments use AI and also offer software solutions to Nvidia's AI hardware customers. That helps to provide a flywheel effect as its next-generation AI architecture continues to improve and be utilized in its various platform solutions.The upcoming quarterly report could bring share price volatility, but investors should look to hold Nvidia for its long-term potential. A pullback that might come from the quarterly report would just provide an opportunity to buy more Nvidia stock.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) has been a rocket ship since early 2023. In just over 24 months, the stock has gone from under $8 to $115, an incredible 1,700% sprint. It's safe to say that things have gone well for shareholders.It's also fair to wonder whether a stock split may soon be on the table. Investors generally love stock splits, and Palantir has developed a reputation for being especially friendly to individual investors. The stock has enjoyed a vocal following that has only grown louder as the share price has risen.Should you be on alert for a stock split? Or, more importantly, should investors buy Palantir in anticipation of one? Here is what you need to know.Sometimes, the most obvious answer is the correct one. Investors usually cheer stock splits because share prices go down, making it easier to trade the stock.However, there is more to it than that. For starters, a stock split lowers the share price by proportionately increasing the number of shares. In other words, if you have one share of a stock trading at $1,000 and split it into 10 $100 shares, the stock's value doesn't change -- you have more shares that still add up to the same amount. It's like cutting a pie into halves and then quarters. More people can have some, but the pie doesn't get any larger.Additionally, the stock's per-share revenue, profits, and other financials would split similarly. Perhaps the most important takeaway is that stock splits don't change a stock's fundamentals or valuation; they only lower the share price by dividing the company into more shares.Stock splits can also send investors a message. If a company's stock achieves a high share price, a stock split is sort of like management saying: Things are great here, so we want to make it cost less for individual investors to participate in owning our stock.You can see below that much of Palantir's investment success has come over the past year:That means many of Palantir's employees who have received stock-based compensation before 2024 are sitting on massive gains. Some people don't want to cash out in large lump sums. Employees can more easily control their stock sales if the equity is in a larger number of smaller shares.At the same time, a stock split helps individual investors who want to invest money into the company but don't want to do so at over $100 per share. Many brokerages allow you to buy fractional shares, but still, many would prefer accumulating cheaper shares than adding fractions of a share at a time.Palantir's share price isn't very high compared to where other companies have split. Some have split their stock at over $1,000 per share. However, Palantir has appreciated so much over the past few years that a stock split could make a lot of sense here.Ultimately, it's anyone's guess whether Palantir will perform a stock split (or when). Above all else, don't base your decision to buy Palantir on a potential stock split.Investors should buy or sell stocks based on the company's underlying fundamentals and the investing practices they feel comfortable following. Palantir stock has done so well that it's become debatable whether buying shares is wise at these prices. It always helps when you invest for the long term and use dollar-cost averaging to manage the volatility in stocks like Palantir.Let stock splits be something fun to talk about if they happen. Remember, they don't matter much if you focus on the right things.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "On Feb. 4, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported mixed performance in the 2024 fourth quarter. Revenue was up 12% year over year to $96.5 billion, lower than the Wall Street target of $96.67 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) rose 31% to $2.15, barely beating analysts' consensus estimate of $2.13.Investors were mainly disappointed with Google Cloud's top line as revenue of $12 billion fell short of the consensus estimates of $12.2 billion. The market has also raised concerns about the future of Alphabet's free cash flows and margins in the face of aggressive plans for capital expenditures (capex) of $75 billion in 2025, a dramatic increase from $52.5 billion in 2024.Not surprisingly, shares are down more than 9% since the earnings release.The stock has also been hurt by Chinese start-up DeepSeek's claims of developing a large language model with capabilities comparable to OpenAI's GPT4 at significantly lower costs. With the market questioning the huge level of AI spending, investors are also concerned about the monetization prospects of Alphabet's chatbot Gemini.Although these challenges cannot be ignored, the business' fundamentals and financials are still strong. The company generated free cash flow of $72.8 billion and returned $70 billion to shareholders in 2024. Here are some other key reasons it can be a smart pick in 2025.Alphabet has been at the forefront of the ongoing AI revolution with its multifaceted strategy. The company unveiled its most capable AI model, Gemini 2.0, in December 2024, mainly to target the rapidly expanding agentic AI market. The company has also released the workhorse Gemini 2.0 Flash model focused on faster movement of data and enhanced performance for developers and customers.And it has been aggressively infusing AI features across all of its seven key products and platforms -- such as search, advertising, and the cloud -- to increase usage and expand possible functions for its AI.The adoption of this technology has been a major growth catalyst for its cloud business, whose customers are using computing capacity over eight times more for AI training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago. And management has been working on leveraging AI capabilities to optimize efficiency across its entire technology stack, which includes hardware, software models, and products.With Alphabet gearing up to spend $75 billion in capex mainly on technical infrastructure, including data centers and servers, the company may see much faster growth for the now capacity-constrained Google Cloud. Margins may also improve, as management prioritizes AI technologies that enable cost efficiencies.Alphabet's core business continues to impress despite rising competition from AI players. Google Search revenue was up 12.5% year over year to $54 billion, while YouTube advertising sales jumped 14% to $10.5 billion in the fourth quarter.Google Search has demonstrated exceptional strength in financial services (insurance) and retail verticals (especially during the holiday shopping season). The integration of Gemini-powered AI Overviews in search across more than 100 countries has also been a key in driving up usage and user satisfaction for Google Search.This effect is especially pronounced with younger users who are learning to ask new questions and are impressed with AI Overviews' efficiency and speed. Alphabet has also made Circle to Search (touch-screen enabled search functions) available on more than 200 million Android devices -- further driving mobile use of Google Search.Each day, YouTube content was streamed for over 1 billion hours globally on televisions in 2024, making it the leading streaming service in the U.S. based on viewing time.  YouTube has been successful with its short-form videos and podcasts. Connected television accounted for almost 15% of Shorts viewing in the U.S. at the end of 2024.Alphabet shares are trading at nearly 23 times forward earnings, which is reasonable considering the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22.5. Several other reasons show the potential for improvement in the company's valuation multiples in the coming months.Analysts expect revenue and adjusted earnings per share to grow year over year by 11.4% and 11.8%, respectively, in fiscal 2025. Although those estimates may seem modest, they are impressive for a company of Alphabet's scale and geographic reach. The company generated nearly $100.2 billion in net income while its operating margin was a solid 32% in fiscal 2024. It also has a strong balance sheet with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities.Google Cloud is the No. 3 player in the global cloud infrastructure services market, accounting for an 11% share in the fourth quarter of 2024. It demonstrated impressive growth in the quarter, despite capacity constraints. The core Search and YouTube businesses also reported robust growth.Lastly, the company's autonomous driving division, Waymo, has also seen dramatic progress in 2024, by reaching a milestone of safe completion of more than 4 million passenger trips. The service is seeing increased adoption, with an average of over 150,000 trips every week.The planned $75 billion capex for 2025 may seem concerning in the short run, but it could be a major growth catalyst in the long run. Hence, considering all these tailwinds, Alphabet seems like a compelling buy in 2025.Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are fantastic investment vehicles that allow you to own a basket of stocks without picking them individually. ETFs also pool the funds of many investors together, allowing you to easily spread your money across many stocks even if you don't have much money to invest.When choosing an ETF, it's smart to keep it simple. Two standout options are the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: VGT), which tracks some of the publicly traded technology companies, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO), which follows the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) movements. Here's why putting $1,000 toward these ETFs and holding for the long haul could be a wise move.The Vanguard Information Technology ETF provides exposure to one of the fastest-growing and often high-return industries: technology. The ETF follows the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index, giving investors broad exposure to the tech sector without focusing too much on large companies.The companies in this ETF run the tech gamut, including software, hardware, IT services, cloud computing, and semiconductors. The 25/50 rule also ensures that no single stock will account for more than 25% of the fund, and the sum of all stocks with weights above 5% cannot exceed 50% of the index. In short, there is no excessive concentration in small stocks or mega companies.This balanced approach to tech investing has had tremendous results. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has gained about 500% over the past decade, compared to the S&P 500's 250% return. There's no guarantee those impressive returns will continue, but this gives you a real-world look at just how well a diversified tech ETF can perform.Aside from the potential that investing in tech companies offers, there are two reasons why this ETF should be on your short list. The first is that technology is a key economic driver worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) alone will add an estimated $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030. Spreading your money across small and large tech companies alike could go a long way to boosting your long-term returns without having to pick individual winners along the way.Second, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has a low expense ratio of 0.09%. That means you'll spend $9 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested. Vanguard recently lowered many of its expense ratio fees, and this fund was cut from its already previously low expense ratio of 0.10%.One of my favorite ETFs is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better way to diversify your investments while paying a stunning low expense ratio. This ETF follows the S&P 500 index, giving you instant diversification across all sectors of the U.S. while offering exposure to the largest publicly traded companies.The goal of this ETF isn't to beat the market; it's to match its long-term returns -- and do so without having to think about which company has the largest economic moat, which industry is growing the fastest, or how the economy will respond to worldwide events.What's great about the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is that taking a passive approach to investing can still be a fantastic way to earn impressive returns. The S&P 500 has had a historic annual rate of return of 10.1% since 1957 (not accounting for inflation). And Vanguard's ETF has performed well as a result, with returns of 250% over the past decade.The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has a very low expense ratio of just 0.03%, so you'll pay just $3 for every $10,000 invested. That means you'll keep far more of your returns over time, all without having to pick a single stock to invest in.Like any other investment, there's no telling how much the S&P 500 will rise or fall in the coming years. But as Warren Buffett once said, \"Despite some severe interruptions, our country's economic progress has been breathtaking. Our unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America.\"If you tend to agree, putting $1,000 toward either of these Vanguard ETFs is a great place to put your money and let it grow over a lifetime.Before you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasnt one of them.

        "content": "A match-up between Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) may seem odd at first blush, but I know from experience that it's not uncommon for me to decide between two very different places to put my money when making a financial decision.These companies are both leaders in their respective markets, but their stock performance has diverged lately. So, let's look at each one to find out which is the better stock to buy right now.Amazon is well known for its e-commerce platform, which has 40% of the U.S. market, compared to Walmart's 7%, but the company's handful of other services are driving much of its growth.For example, the company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), generated $28.8 billion in sales in the most recent quarter -- just 15% of total company sales -- but accounted for half of Amazon's operating income. AWS holds a 31% share of the cloud market right now, while Microsoft trails with 20%.There's a strong case to be made that AWS could be poised for substantially more growth in the coming years. Many artificial intelligence (AI) services run on cloud computing, and as more companies and individuals tap into AI, they'll likely spend more on cloud services. Based on that demand, Goldman Sachs estimates that AI will push global cloud computing sales to $2 trillion by 2030.Amazon recently reported its fourth-quarter results, with sales rising 10% to $187.8 billion and earnings per share up 54% to $1.86, both ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimates. And the company's advertising business, once an afterthought, now has sales of $17.3 billion.With Amazon's ability to continue posting impressive sales and earnings and its long-term potential to tap into AI cloud revenue, there's a lot to like about buying and holding this stock.Home Depot won't release its fourth-quarter results until later this month, but management has already given investors some insight into the upcoming year on the third-quarter earnings call. CEO Ted Decker said the company continues \"to see pressure on larger remodeling projects, driven by the higher interest-rate environment and continued macroeconomic uncertainty.\"Things might not get better anytime soon, either. The latest January inflation data showed that the Consumer Price Index rose by 3% during the month, higher than expected. That news prompted Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to say that the central bank's work isn't yet done, indicating that interest rate cuts aren't on the table. Home Depot's shares fell on that news.Home sales have slumped to their lowest level in 30 years, causing pain for the home improvement chain. When people don't buy and sell homes, they have fewer DIY projects. With high interest rates likely to stick around longer, many potential homebuyers will continue to stay on the sidelines and avoid big home projects.Same-store sales fell 1.3% in the third quarter, and management estimated they'll be down 2.5% for the year. The company is optimistic that the market will eventually revive, but investors may be waiting awhile before the housing market makes a comeback. Until it does, Home Depot is in a holding pattern.I'm not pessimistic about Home Depot's long-term prospects, but with the company clearly being affected by the slow housing market, I think buying Amazon is the better option right now.Admittedly, you'll pay a bit of a premium for the company's stock right now -- its shares have a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 35 -- but with long-term prospects in AI cloud computing and its dominance in e-commerce, that should help propel Amazon.Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasnt one of them.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "One of the most popular ways to invest in stocks is to buy the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). The Vanguard fund is popular for a reason: Its long record of closely tracking the S&P 500, combined with its low expense ratio, makes it a top S&P 500 index fund.Investors have been well rewarded for patiently investing in an index fund like Vanguard's in recent years. The S&P 500 is up roughly 70% in just 28 months since hitting the bottom of the bear market in October of 2022. Much of that growth was fueled by big tech companies closely tied to the widespread emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).But not every great AI stock is included in the S&P 500, which means index investors could be missing out.Many people know the S&P 500 consists of 500 of the largest companies in the total stock market. But S&P Global has several criteria beyond size that exclude some companies, even if they're massive, trillion-dollar businesses. Specifically, the S&P 500 requires companies to have their headquarters and a plurality of their assets in the United States and be profitable on a GAAP basis in the most recent quarter and trailing-12-month period.As a result, a company like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) isn't included in the index. But this brilliant AI semiconductor company still trades at a great price, and investors can easily add it to their portfolio alongside the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.When industry-leading semiconductor companyz Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) wants to create a new graphics processing unit (GPU), it doesn't have the capability of actually producing that chip itself. It needs to outsource the manufacturing to another company with the facilities and technology to actually etch silicon wafers and package them. That's where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, comes in.TSMC works with chip designers to print their chips using its facilities and, more importantly, its proprietary processes. TSMC has spent heavily on research and development to create new processes that can place transistors closer together on silicon, increasing the power efficiency of each chip.Sometimes TSMC will work closely with a customer to develop a new process for certain applications. For example, Nvidia's newest GPUs, the Blackwell platform, use a custom process that increases the total number of transistors on the chip.TSMC is one of just three chip manufacturers capable of producing the most advanced chips at scale. And it holds a commanding position in the overall chip manufacturing market, with over 60% market share. It's the only company with the resources to dedicate to Nvidia or other big customers, including Apple and Broadcom.Importantly, TSMC's scale gives it more capital to invest in research and development, ensuring it maintains its technology lead. As a result, it should remain at the top of chip designers list when it comes to producing their most advanced chips for applications like GPUs for AI data centers or a system-on-chip for a smartphone. That further increases its available capacity, which it can use to cater to its biggest customers.When TSMC released its fourth-quarter earnings results in January, it shared a very rosy outlook about its future. Management forecasts AI-related sales growth of 40% per year over the next five years. That should help produce 20% overall compound annual revenue growth for the business over the same period.The company is spending heavily to facilitate that growth. It's budgeting roughly $40 billion for capital expenditures in 2025, a 35% year-over-year increase. TSMC has historically been very smart about its capital expenditures, ensuring it doesn't outspend its potential growth. Still, investors should be aware the semiconductor industry is very cyclical, and significant overhead costs can weigh on financial results during downturns.It's worth noting, however, that TSMC has the potential to benefit from growing AI chip demand no matter who designs those chips because of its unique manufacturing capabilities and scale. So, while many big tech companies are working to shift away from a reliance on Nvidia, they'll still use TSMC to make their custom silicon for their AI servers.So, TSMC presents a less volatile option than individual chip designers when it comes to investing in AI. At a valuation of just 23 times forward earnings estimates, it's an absolute bargain. TSMC is far from the only big company excluded from the S&P 500, but it's one of the most attractive large-cap stocks outside of the index right now.Vanguard S&P 500 ETF investors who want to add the semiconductor stock to their portfolio might consider adding it such that its weight is on par with the rest of the holdings. TSMC's market cap of roughly $1 trillion as of this writing would make it worth around 2% of the entire S&P 500. So, investors could simply shift 2% of their holdings in the index to Taiwan Semiconductor's stock to ensure they get their fair share of the stock's gains.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "This February, Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) is continuing to one-up Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and its biggest rival. And, given Ethereum's ongoing leadership shake-up, there's a good chance that the hits will just keep coming.Here's what's happening and how it affects your choices about where to park your money.Solana and Ethereum are both major players for decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, as well as hot spots of trading across decentralized financial exchanges. They're also among the very largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, as well as by the number of different tokens and projects hosted on their blockchains. That makes them direct competitors, and it makes the details of their competitive fight highly relevant when it comes to choosing which to invest in.In particular, the sheer amount of trading volume on each chain is a major battleground. More trading volume means more stress on the network, increasing the chances of congestion, but it also means generating more gas (user) fees to finance the network's infrastructure costs and, potentially, additional activities like upgrades and marketing.Through Feb. 11, this month is seeing Solana eat Ethereum's lunch in ways that are larger than ever. It reported trading volume in excess of $60 million against Ethereum's $34 million.That higher volume has real consequences; in January, high trading volumes gave Solana $124 million in revenue, versus $109 million for Ethereum. The extra revenue could easily translate into more sustained outperformance for Solana over time.It's likely that the difference is at least partly due to Solana's intense meme coin investing scene. While laden with scams, it is vastly larger than Ethereum's, owing to Solana's dramatically lower transaction fees and significantly faster transaction times.Despite many attempts at solving those issues, Ethereum does not appear to be anywhere close to being as fast or cheap as its competitor. It is uncertain whether the replacement of top leaders to emphasize technical talent will be an effective remedy.Furthermore, there aren't any clear catalysts in store that would enable Ethereum to strike back and retake some of the market's activity relative to Solana specifically. Nor have investors been excited about Ethereum lately, given that during the past 12 months its price declined 2%, compared to Solana's gain of about 80%.The most obvious way that investors can make use of this information is to invest in Solana rather than Ethereum.Given Solana's near-term tailwinds, like further meme coin activity and artificial intelligence (AI) agent infrastructure projects starting to take off on the chain, the coin is worth buying. Its long-term picture looks as strong as ever.Newer tailwinds from a crypto-friendly presidential administration and the possible approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the coin may also give it a boost.But there's another argument here. Ethereum didn't become a major cryptocurrency by refusing to innovate in response to trends in its sector. Nor does any other blockchain have as deep a roster of skilled developers.And, while it's a bit subjective, there's at least some reason to believe that its smart-contract features are more comprehensive than Solana's, which could be a point in its favor in the buildout of AI agent infrastructure, because AI agents would hypothetically rely heavily on such functions.In other words, Ethereum is more likely to adapt and make at least some headway on solving or mitigating its problems over the long term. In five years, its price is almost certainly going to be higher than it is today, even if Solana's probably ends up gaining more.Therefore, if you're a contrarian investor, consider that right now, you might want to buy Ethereum instead, since the sentiment around it is awful, and it might prove to be a bargain compared to the price in the future.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has a stock portfolio worth about $300 billion, with many of its positions selected by legendary investor Warren Buffett himself. To be fair, there's a solid long-term investment case to be made for most, if not all, of them.Having said that, some look more attractive than others right now. Here are two that trade for exceptionally cheap valuations, despite having excellent growth potential in 2025 and beyond.Warren Buffett has been a fan of the banking industry for many years, and some of his largest stock investments are banks, including Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and American Express (NYSE: AXP). However, there's only one relatively small U.S. bank stock you'll find in the portfolio: Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY).Ally is primarily an auto lender and was spun off from General Motors (NYSE: GM). It also has a large retail banking platform, with over $140 billion in customer deposits.Recently, Ally decided to simplify its business. It has agreed to sell its credit card business, and it stopped making mortgage loans in January, choosing to focus on what it does best -- auto lending, auto insurance, and consumer banking.Because auto loans have relatively high interest rates (9.09% yield on average), there's the potential for excellent margins. Ally does a great job of maintaining strong loan quality, and it could be a big winner as interest rates gradually come down and its deposit cost starts to decrease. With shares trading for just over 10 times forward earnings, and with a 3.2% dividend yield, Ally could be a no-brainer Buffett stock to look at more closely.SiriusXM (NASDAQ: SIRI) isn't just a Berkshire stock holding -- it's one of the few stocks Berkshire has actually been buying in recent quarters. After a series of additions to its position, Berkshire now owns a staggering 35.4% of the satellite radio leader.SiriusXM has fallen by about 50% over the past year, and for some good reasons. There are major worries about a declining subscriber base and lack of growth. The company's subscriber base peaked nearly six years ago, and revenue is expected to decline in 2025.However, SiriusXM's management is well aware of the issues and is making big moves to turn things around. It is leaning into its advertising business in a few ways, including the launch of a free ad-supported product tier. It's also taking steps to capitalize on its core market of new car buyers, such as with its three-year, dealer-paid subscription program that is gaining traction. Management hopes to add 10 million new subscribers and to grow free cash flow by 30% by 2027, compared to expected 2025 levels.With a valuation of just 7.6 times its expected 2025 free cash flow, a 4.1% dividend yield, and an improving balance sheet, SiriusXM makes a lot of sense from a risk-reward standpoint at the current price.To be perfectly clear, I think both of these stocks look like excellent opportunities in 2025, but I have no idea what their stock prices are going to do over the next few weeks or months.

        "content": "Its the incredible, bendable, unbreakable stock market. Or so it seems.Stocks took everything the bears threw at them over the past week  hot inflation data, fading interest-rate-cut expectations and fresh rounds of tariffs  and went on to score solid weekly gains. That wasnt enough to launch the S&P 500 SPX out of the sideways trading pattern thats largely prevailed in the new year, but bulls argue it may just be a matter of time.I want to enjoy the time we have left: Im 68 and plan to work past retirement age. Should I empty my $700K 401(k)?He was very paranoid of banks: My mother found $35,000 in cash after my father died. What should she do with it? My date was so awful that, before we parted ways, I asked her to repay me for 50% of the taxi fare. Was I being cheap?We have no prenuptial agreement: Will my wife be able to take my money if I transfer it to my retirement account?Im a wife and mother. Can I secretly change my will and leave everything to my daughter instead of my husband?Resiliency has been the theme not just this week, but the last few weeks, when you think about some of these headlines, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, told MarketWatch on Friday.Going into the past week, Turnquist said that if you had told him what was in store regarding tariffs, the hot January consumer-price index and other developments, he would have looked for a 2% to 3% down week.Instead, stocks have continued to trade sideways. In fact, the S&P 500 has hung within 5% of its all-time high over the past two months, noted Dean Christians, senior research analyst at SentimenTrader, in a Friday note.Whats more, the S&P 500 has achieved just one record finish over that period  on Jan. 23  and ended Thursday just 0.06% below that record, fulfilling a trading pattern thats often preceded past upside breakouts, Christians wrote (see chart and table below).The S&P 500 has demonstrated remarkable resilience over the past few months, consolidating within a narrow range despite a flurry of alarming headlines. This sideways movement amid uncertainty signals buyers maintain control, keeping the market on solid footing, Christians wrote.SentimenTrader found that such consolidation often precedes an upside breakout, with the index rallying 77% of the time in the following two weeks, based on 22 signals going back to 1928.The index on Friday traded above its Jan. 23 record close of 6,118.23 before ending the day with a small loss. The S&P 500 logged a weekly gain of 1.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 2%.A weekly close above the existing S&P 500 record would mark the breakout that bulls have been looking for. Extrapolating the recent trading range, that would offer a technical upside target of around 6,350, said LPLs Turnquist.The S&P 500 gapped lower on Jan. 27 as investors panicked over Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeeks claims that it had trained an AI model much cheaper than rival U.S. large-language models, casting doubt on expectations for massive AI-related spending that has benefited key players such as chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA But stocks soon clawed back those losses to push back toward the top of the range.The following Monday, Feb. 3, stocks plunged at the open, again leaving a gap on the daily chart, after President Donald Trump pledged 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. Trump soon partly relented, announcing later in the day that he would delay the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month after the leaders of both countries said they would step up border enforcement and crack down on cross-border drug trafficking. Stocks subsequently pared their losses.Turnquist said the presidents at least temporary reversal on those tariffs appeared to reassure investors that a figurative Trump put existed not far below current market levels. In other words, the move left investors believing Trump would take his cues from the market, holding off on policies that would put significant pressure on the market.That reinforced what appears to be a conviction among retail traders to aggressively buy the dip on any downturn, Turnquist noted. That was reflected in the S&P 500s ability to hold support at its 50-day moving average on Wednesday after the January consumer-price index came in much hotter-than-expected, sending Treasury yields jumping and leading investors to further curtail expectations for rate cuts in 2025.Stocks were buoyed on Thursday after the January producer-price index, while also coming in hot, soothed inflation worries somewhat. Thats because components of the PPI reading indicated the Federal Reserves favored inflation gauge, the personal-consumption expenditures index, will actually come in a touch cooler than Wall Street had begun to fear.Also Thursday, Trump ordered his administration to explore how to impose reciprocal tariffs on a wide number of U.S. trading partners, with officials saying the moves could come as soon as April 1. Investors cheered because they feared the tariffs would take effect immediately.It still isnt clear how hard-hitting the tariffs will be. But economists have warned that the measures under discussion could pack a significant punch, push up inflation in the near term and further undercut expectations for further Fed rate cuts.Continued uncertainty around tariffs and other potential policy pronouncements offer some misgivings over the prospects for a breakout, Turnquist said.Typically, you dont get a sustained breakout in periods of high uncertainty, he said. But Turnquist is also reluctant to fight the tape and trends should the S&P 500 confirm a breakout to the upside  adding that leadership has been pretty risk-on, with traditional defensive sectors such as healthcare, utilities and consumer staples lagging behind.If the S&P 500 manages a breakout with that kind of leadership, thats a good sign, he said.My wife and I are very grateful: Our son wants to pay off our mortgage before we retire.

        "content": "Long-term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it smooths out short-term volatility and allows a company's fundamental value to shine through. Tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been at the forefront of generative artificial intelligence (AI) growth. But as the hype inevitably fades and new opportunities like robotics and self-driving cars potentially have their turn in the sun, how will Nvidia respond?With roughly 88% of revenue ($30.8 billion) coming from its data center segment, Nvidia is very overexposed to the market for generative AI hardware. This under-diversification puts the tech giant in a perilous position, especially as clients continue to lose money on their AI projects and new low-cost rivals like China's DeepSeek cause shareholders to question the industry's long-term profit potential.The growing popularity of custom chips also allows key AI clients like OpenAI to bypass Nvidia and design their own hardware through partnerships with fab companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.But while generative AI now dominates Nvidia's narrative, it wasn't always like this. The company has a history of shifting focus to tackle emerging trends. As recently as fiscal 2022, video game and crypto mining hardware (Nvidia's gaming segment) represented around 46% of total sales ($12.46 billion) compared to just 9.4% today as AI-related growth has overshadowed these once crucial opportunities.Nvidia's rapid business transformation highlights the versatility of its core technology, the graphics processing unit (GPU), a type of computer chip that uses parallel processing to perform multiple calculations simultaneously. And over the next 10 years, investors should expect GPUs to continue finding new uses, even if demand related to generative AI slows down. Robotics and autonomous vehicles look promising. According to analysts at McKinsey & Company, autonomous driving could create $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue by 2035 as automakers take advantage of the technology for software as a service (SaaS). And just like generative AI, self-driving cars need to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately, making this industry a potential gold mine for Nvidia and its industry-leading GPUs.Tesla is a good example of the potential scale of the opportunity. Despite not offering a well-known generative AI large language model (LLM), the automaker is one of Nvidia's key customers. It is accumulating tens of thousands of GPUs to build its Dojo supercomputer, which is designed to be the brain behind its full self-driving (FSD) platform.Nvidia also positions itself to play a direct role in the automotive industry through software like its Drive AGX, designed to synergize with its hardware to enable self-driving functions and process driving data.As of the third quarter, Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment generated sales of $449 million. While this is a drop in the bucket compared to its total revenue of $35 billion, the segment grew by an impressive 72% year over year. And investors can expect that increase to accelerate over the coming decade.The generative AI boom is getting long in the tooth, and demand for Nvidia's GPUs may eventually slow as companies look for cheaper alternatives. However, over the long term, new opportunities like robotics and self-driving cars could pick up the slack. That said, it is not a good idea to buy Nvidia at the height of its current hype cycle. Investors may want to wait for more information before considering a position in the stock.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Growth stocks are a great tool to build lasting wealth in the stock market. Three Motley Fool contributors believe Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG), and Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) offer excellent return prospects over the long term, but Wall Street analysts also see the potential for upside in the near term. Analyst price targets on these stocks range from 44% to 72%. Here's why these stocks could deliver solid returns in 2025 and beyond.John Ballard (Celsius Holdings): Celsius has emerged as a leading brand in a growing energy drink market. It has delivered phenomenal returns to investors over the last five years, but it's currently dealing with a weak consumer spending environment that is weighing on retail traffic and pressuring sales growth.The stock has fallen 78% from its previous peak, but Wall Street analysts see significant upside from these levels. The average price target is currently $37.91, implying upside of 72% at the time of writing.The stock is trading at a much lower price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, which may undervalue its future growth. Celsius is in a solid competitive position, aligning its brand with the trend toward zero-sugar and \"better-for-you\" ingredients. Over a quarter of energy drink consumers between the ages of 18 and 34 say that healthy ingredients are important in their purchase decisions.It's for these reasons that Celsius stock is a good bet at these lower share prices. The energy and sports drink market is expected to grow from $112 billion this year to $136 billion by 2029, according to Statista.Celsius has grown much faster than the industry, increasing annual revenue from less than $100 million to over $1.3 billion in the past five years. That leaves plenty of headroom to gain more share over the long term to fuel above-average growth.Analysts expect Celsius to report a revenue increase of 3% for 2024 before improving to 15% in 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. The stock's forward P/E of 23 is a very reasonable valuation to start a position. The timing of when it reaches the average analyst price target is uncertain because it has a lot to do with macroeconomic factors that are outside the company's control. For this reason, the stock may hit new lows before it heads higher, but investors should expect the stock to deliver excellent returns over the long term.Jennifer Saibil (Sweetgreen): Investors who missed Chipotle Mexican Grill's stunning success are keeping their eyes out for the next successful fast-casual restaurant brand. Sweetgreen, which focuses on healthy bowls and salads, is a small but growing chain, and the market sees a lot of potential.Sweetgreen had 235 locations as of the end of the 2024 third quarter, and it opens at a fairly slow rate. It opened five net new stores in the third quarter, with plans for around 25 for the full fiscal year. Revenue increased 13% year over year in the quarter, driven by new stores and helped along by same-store sales, which were up 6% year over year. That's a strong showing considering the high-inflation environment, and it implies a strong future for this small company.Although Sweetgreen isn't profitable, it's getting closer. Operating loss improved from $26.5 million last year to $21.5 million this year, and restaurant-level profit was $34.9 million at a 20% margin, up from $29.1 million at a 19% margin the previous year. It isn't likely to become net profitable this year, and Wall Street is expecting a $0.41 loss per share in 2025. But investors are excited about the concept, and Sweetgreen is just starting. It's likely to hit profitability as it scales.Sweetgreen stock is up 112% over the past year, but it still appears to be reasonably priced, trading at a price-to-sales ratio of just over 4. That's an excellent price for a stock with a lot of future potential, and it's not surprising that the average price target consensus on Wall Street is $43.50, or 72% higher than it is today.Still, this isn't a stock for every investor. The company is young and unprofitable, and although that comes with huge upside potential, it also comes with risk. If you have an appetite for some, you might want to follow Wall Street into a small position in Sweetgreen stock.Jeremy Bowman (Shopify): Shopify was one of the biggest losers in the 2022 bear market, but after a reset that involved divesting the Deliverr fulfillment business and forging a detente with Amazon around Buy with Prime, Shopify is back to delivering impressive growth on the top and bottom line.In the fourth quarter, gross merchandise value, or the value of goods sold on its platform, rose 26% to $94.4 billion, which lifted revenue up 31% to $2.81 billion, topping the consensus at $2.73 billion.The company is now solidly profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and operating income improved from $289 million to $465 million.Better yet, Shopify expects its strong growth to continue into 2025, calling for mid-20s percentage growth in revenue and low-20s growth rate in gross profit.Shopify is consistently innovating and growing, attracting new businesses, both large and small, to its leading e-commerce platform, and the company is earning recognition from Wall Street.Citigroup recently raised its price target on Shopify stock from $143 to $175, noting more optimism in front-office software budgets, a sign that more companies were likely to move to Shopify's platform. Based on that price target, Shopify stock has 44% upside.The stock might be expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of 80, but the company has proven it deserves a premium. Shopify looks like a good bet to keep moving higher.Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Celsius wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Brookfield Corporation (NYSE: BN) is coming off another excellent year. The leading global investment firm delivered record financial results. That helped catapult its stock, which generated a market-crushing 55% return -- more than double the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 26% total return. That continued the company's multi-decade record of outperformance (it has generated a 19% annualized return over the last 30 years, compared to 11% for the S&P 500). The company is in an excellent position to continue delivering robust returns for shareholders. Its businesses are growing briskly, and it trades at a wide discount compared to its intrinsic value. Because of that, it's a great stock to buy and hold.\"We delivered record financial results in 2024, with strong contributions from each of our businesses,\" stated president Nick Goodman in Brookfield Corporation's fourth-quarter earnings press release. The company reported nearly $4.9 billion, or $3.07 per share, of distributable earnings (DE) before realizations. That implied 24% growth on an absolute basis and 15% per share compared to 2023's level. Its DE was even higher when factoring in realizations (earnings from monetizing mature assets) at almost $6.3 billion, or $3.96 per share, an increase of more than 30%.The biggest contributor was its wealth solutions business, which produced $1.4 billion of DE, a nearly 100% increase compared to the prior year. That business has been scaling rapidly, driven by a string of acquisitions in recent years. These deals have positioned Brookfield as the top-tier writer of retail annuities in the U.S., with a growing pension business. It has also expanded its business overseas by reinsuring $1.3 billion of U.K. pension liabilities last year. The company's asset management business, Brookfield Asset Management, also had a strong year, contributing $2.6 billion to its DE. That business generates strong and growing fee-related earnings (17% growth last year) as investors continue to pour capital into the funds it manages. Brookfield Asset Management raised $135 billion from investors last year, including $40 billion across its latest round of flagship funds (second global transition fund strategy, fifth opportunistic real estate fund strategy, and flagship opportunistic credit fund strategy.) Meanwhile, the company's operating businesses in renewable power (Brookfield Renewable), infrastructure (Brookfield Infrastructure), private equity (Brookfield Business), and real estate delivered steady and growing cash flow. They combined to contribute $1.6 billion in DE last year. Operating funds from operations across its renewable power, transition, and infrastructure businesses were up 10% last year. Meanwhile, its core real estate portfolio (offices and malls) delivered a 4% increase in same-store net operating income last year. Finally, Brookfield sold nearly $40 billion of mature assets across its funds and operating businesses, generating $1.4 billion in DE. Notable sales included a portfolio of U.S. manufactured housing assets and several renewable power and infrastructure assets around the world. Brookfield's growing franchises have increased its intrinsic value. CEO Bruce Flatt wrote about the firm's rising value in his fourth-quarter letter to investors. He commented: Our ability to consistently generate attractive investment returns has led to the continued growth of our intrinsic value over a long period of time. The intrinsic value of each share increased by $15 in 2024. At our best estimate, the intrinsic value now backing each one of your shares is approximately $100, which was a 19% total return in 2024. This underpins the conservative investment you own and, all else being equal, should allow you to earn a greater return than the underlying performance of our business.This valuation estimate is important to keep in mind following the stock's surge last year. While the share price increased 55%, it currently trades at around $60. That's still a roughly 40% discount to the company's intrinsic value. That suggests the stock should continue to rise. Meanwhile, the company expects its intrinsic value to continue growing. Its five-year plan would increase its intrinsic value above $175 per share. Multiple catalysts drive that view. They include the continued expansion of its asset management business, the expected surge in wealth solutions' earnings (it has a clear line of sight to grow its annual DE to more than $2 billion in the near term), steady growth in its operating business (including the recovery in the real estate market), and its ability to sell mature assets and recycle that capital into higher-returning new investments. Brookfield Corporation has been a wealth-creating machine over the years. The company's platforms generate significant and growing earnings, giving it more capital to compound value for shareholders. It's in an excellent position to continue growing value for investors, given its myriad of growth drivers. With its stock price still trading at a significant discount to its intrinsic value even after last year's surge, Brookfield remains a top stock to buy.

        "content": "Rivian Automotives (RIVN) electric SUV and pickup truck models look great, but its stock value isnt as alluring. The companys shares have been down 90% since its IPO in 2021. With internal mechanics spluttering and industry-wide challenges mounting, RIVN looks like a bit of a caterpillar for investors. Low demand, supply constraints, and ongoing cash burn have all undermined the companys performance and shareholder outcomes.Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  Your Smart PortfolioWhile some analysts are optimistic about substantial revenue growth in the next five years, hoping the stock will finally take flight as a beautiful butterfly for investors, RIVNs most significant hurdle stands tall: finally reporting positive gross margins after years of fanciful promises and missed targets.As Q4 earnings approach later this month, management hopes the quarter will be the first step toward profitability, with supply issues no longer a significant problem. While that could give Rivians stock a short-term boost, I struggle to see how the company can satisfy the markets high expectations, which led to the stock being severely overvalued.The markets bullish outlook on RIVN stock depends on the companys bounceback in 2025 after a tough 2024. Over the past year, Rivians stock has fallen 14%, thanks to industry-wide challenges and supply chain issues.At the start of January, the company briefly lifted investor spirits by reporting that it met its production and delivery targetsproducing 49,500 vehicles and delivering 51,500, just above initial expectations. But the big news for early 2025 was the easing of a previously reported component shortage, which had been holding back production. Despite this positive update, Rivian still faces substantial operating losses, reporting a $1.2 billion loss for the most recent quarter. The company is working to cut production costs by finding cheaper materials and suppliers, but the road to profitability is bumpy at best.For the first three quarters of 2024, Rivian reported a $4 billion operational loss. While thats a slight improvement from the $4.16 billion loss the company posted in the same period in 2023, the reality is that Rivian is burning through cash at an unsustainable pace. Since the cost of revenues is a significant issue for Rivian (and most, if not all, EV companies), scaling production becomes a big challenge with the need for heavy upfront investment in materials and components. For Rivian, increasing vehicle sales doesnt immediately lower production costs. Unlike tech companies that can leverage economies of scale, Rivians path to profitability is slower and more complex.Since Rivian is still far from profitability and in the early stages of growth, traditional valuation metrics may not give a complete picture of the companys value. In this case, using the reverse discounted cash flow method might be a more helpful way to assess Rivians valuation.Right now, Rivians stock is trading at $12.50 per share, which, based on my calculations, suggests an ambitious 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31%. To arrive at this rate, Im using Rivians most recent twelve-month figures for the base year, which show a revenue of $4.55 billion and the automotive industrys average operating margins of 8% (since Rivians margins are currently negative). I also factored in depreciation and amortization of $1 billion and capex of $1.12 billion for the same period. For these calculations, I assumed a WACC (Discount Rate) of 10%, which is reasonably moderate, and a long-term growth rate of 2.5%.If Rivian can turn its margins positiveat least in line with the automotive industryit would still need to hit revenues of ~$17.5 billion by 2030. Thats a pretty steep mountain to climb, considering the challenges Rivian is facing in scaling its EV production.Surprisingly, Wall Streets long-term outlook for Rivian is somewhat bullish. Analysts expect the company to bring in $4.67 billion in revenue in 2025 and $40.13 billion by 2030, which suggests a solid 56% revenue CAGR.On Wall Street, RIVN stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on two Buy, seven Hold, and two Sell ratings over the past three months. RIVNs average price target of $13.78 per share implies a ~9% upside potential compared to current levels.Going against the consensus, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska has a Sell rating on Rivian stock and is skeptical about these long-term optimistic projections. He thinks the consensus is overestimating the market for Rivians cars and not fully accounting for the vast capital expenditures required to hit those revenue targets.Another bear is CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson, who is skeptical about Rivian achieving a positive gross margin in 2025. The analyst also remains concerned about the companys cash burn rates, especially given concerns about U.S.-based demand for EVs.On February 20, after the closing bell, Rivian will report its Q4 and full 2024 results, although preliminary delivery figures have already been released. To beat market expectations, Rivian must report a loss per share of less than 69 cents and revenues above $1.39 billion.Still, I believe the key focus will be on Rivians goal of achieving positive gross margins in Q4 and throughout FY2025. According to last quarters forecast, the company aims to reach this milestone through cost-cutting initiatives and operational efficiencies. For example, Rivian has already reduced material costs per vehicle by 20% in Q4 compared to earlier in the year.Additionally, Rivian is working on new vehicle platforms, like the R2, which are expected to significantly lower manufacturing costs. The R2 platform, set to launch in 2026, is designed to be more cost-efficient, allowing Rivian to offer vehicles at lower price points while improving margins.So, if Rivian manages to surprise the market by posting positive gross margins and giving a bold outlook for 2025, it could trigger a stock re-rating. This would serve as a strong short-term catalyst and could help the stock spring higher and consolidate its gains, having been under pressure for so long.Im not a big fan of electric vehicle companies losing so much money when demand isnt growing as fast as some may have hoped. Rivian is precisely in this predicamentstruggling to scale its business and far away from steady profitability. Currently, the only way to improve margins is by cutting costs and tweaking vehicle inputs.The management team is confident Rivian will report positive gross margins in Q4, continuing through 2025. However, maintaining strong margins over the long term will be tough. Rivian needs to scale its operations significantly to hit Wall Streets ambitious revenue targets over the next five years. As I believe this is crucial for justifying its stock price, Im bearish on Rivian, as I think some frustration will eventually show up during its arduous uphill climb.Still, I think positive gross margins in Q4 and a better outlook for 2025 could give the stock a short-term boost (and thereby allow exasperated investors waiting for better levels to sell at to make a run for the trees, safe in the knowledge that this caterpillar will not transform into a butterfly anytime soon).DisclosureDisclaimer"

        "content": "By Rishav Chatterjee and Rajasik Mukherjee(Reuters) - Australian insurance companies fell sharply on Monday after opposition leader Peter Dutton threatened to break them up, accusing them of exploiting customers, as the country prepares for federal elections due by May.In an interview with Sky News, Dutton, leader of the Liberal Party, said that if elected in the federal election, his government would scrutinise insurance industry practices.\"In the insurance market, we will intervene to make sure that consumers get a fair go because at the moment people are paying too much for their insurance and what's resulting is that people aren't taking out insurance,\" Dutton said in the broadcast on Sunday.The Australian insurance market is dominated by major players Suncorp Group, Insurance Australia Group (IAG) and QBE Insurance. Suncorp shares slumped 21.3% and IAG fell 4.1%, while QBE dropped as much as 1%.Suncorp shares slid to their lowest since May 30, 2024 and dropped the most since June 2020, while IAG's stock hit a more than three-month low.Australia's opposition Liberal-National Coalition is leading the incumbent Labor, according to new opinion polls while a federal election looms large within three months, the latest indication of growing discontent with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government.Last week, IAG reported first-half earnings with its top-line growth and dividend missing estimates while Suncorp was trading ex-dividend on Monday.\"Peter Dutton's comments probably didn't do sentiment for insurance companies any favours either,\" said Tim Waterer, market analyst at KCM Trade.\"While at this stage it remains just an idea which has been floated, the comments did demonstrate that insurers and their practices have caught the attention of the opposition leader and therefore could come under closer policy scrutiny down the track.\"Insurance premiums have spiked over the past year, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data revealing a 16.4% increase, marking the largest rise in about thirty years.Higher mortgage repayments amid a cost of living crisis have stretched household budgets.\"Insurance customers need to demand a better deal from state governments,\" said Andrew Hall, CEO of Insurance Council of Australia.\"State and territory governments collect more tax on insurance products than insurance companies make in profit. The abolition of state insurance taxes would reduce premiums by 10 to 30%, providing immediate cost of living relief.\"(Reporting by Rishav Chatterjee and Rajasik Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)"

This is the first set of full-year results with Georges Elhedery at the helm as HSBC's CEO.Standard Chartered's 2024 profit may jump 22 per cent to US$4.23 billion, according to forecasts.

This gave Standard Chartered a stronger growth momentum compared to HSBC.\"HSBC's Group Chief Executive Georges Elhedery during the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Wan Chai on 19 November 2024.

Photo: Dickson Lee>Standard Chartered's 2024 pre-tax profit may have grown by 18 per cent, while HSBC's pre-tax income may have increased by 5 per cent, Ng said.Both banks are expected to buy back their shares from the market, maintaining last year's budget when HSBC spent US$2 billion, while Standard Chartered poured US$1 billion into buy-backs, analysts said.The aggregated pre-tax profit among the city's 30 retail banks increased by 8.4 per cent in the first nine months of 2024, slower than the 62 per cent jump in 2023 and 18.7 per cent in 2022, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).\"Profitability remained good among the banks\", the HKMA's Deputy Chief Executive Arthur Yuen Kwok-hang said in January, noting that the city's banks must \"focus more on bad debt issues and the increasing trend of financial scams this year\".HSBC's growth pace slowed last year, compared with the 56 per cent jump in 2023 when the bank reaped the benefits of a fat interest rate margin during the post-pandemic surge in loans and demand for wealth-management products.\"The strongest growth driver [of HSBC's 2024 results] comes from non-interest income, reflecting a favourable investment market that has boosted the wealth and personal banking and global banking and markets,\" said Ng, who recommends investors buy the stock. \"On the other hand, net interest income has been under pressure, which has partially offset the growth contributed by non-interest income.\"All eyes are on Elhedery to see if he announces on Wednesday any more moves to cut costs. He has reorganised the top echelons of the 160-year-old bank since taking over last September from Noel Quinn, moves that prompted JPMorgan to raise its estimate of HSBC's 2025 per-share earnings by 5 per cent.\"The recent movements in the forward yield curve and potential cost savings from HSBC's reorganisation provide upside risk to our total return estimates,\" JPMorgan said in a November 18 research note. \"On the other hand, asset quality risk from Hong Kong commercial real estate (4 per cent of loans) and increase in tariffs is manageable.\"Hong Kong's banks are facing thinner margins, as the HKMA cut its base rate three times since September in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve. HSBC and Standard Chartered have followed by slashing their prime rates by a combined 0.625 percentage points.\"HSBC is expected to report strong growth in its non-interest income\", said KGI Asia's head of investment strategy Kenny Wen. \"The higher-for-longer US Fed rates last year will benefit interest income, [while] the restructuring of its businesses is expected to create synergistic effects and reduce expenses.\"HSBC and Standard Chartered are headquartered in London, but earn most of their profits in Asia and count Hong Kong as their single biggest market. The results of the two currency issuing banks reflect how interest-rate cuts and a weaker economy are affecting Hong Kong's lenders.KGI's Wen expected Standard Chartered to report growth in its fourth quarter, with its pre-tax profit possibly reaching US$1.3 billion, but the bank may face challenges of slower loan growth and narrower interest margin due to the rate cut.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping held a rare, highly choreographed meeting on Monday with some of the biggest names in China's technology sector, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma, in what analysts saw as a show of support to rally private companies.The event, a turnaround in Beijing's approach to its tech giants from a regulatory clampdown four years ago, reflected policymakers' concern about a slowdown in growth and efforts by the United States to limit China's technological development.Xi's move to gather business leaders, including those behind breakout successes despite U.S. pressure in recent months, underscores the importance of private-sector innovation for China to gain ground in technology, analysts said.\"It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the United States,\" said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong.\"The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the United States.\"The private sector in China, which competes with state-owned companies, contributes more than half of tax revenue, more than 60% of economic output and 70% of tech innovation, official estimates show.U.S. tariffs threaten more pressure on the world's second-largest economy, which has been reeling from weak domestic consumption and a destabilising debt crisis in the property sector.Liang Wenfeng, founder of DeepSeek, a startup that threatens to upset American AI ventures with its lower-cost AI model, attended, two sources familiar with the meeting said.Xi called the meeting in the ceremonial Great Hall of the People, the same setting he used in 2018 for a similar meeting during the trade war at the time of the first administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.The first images from Chinese state media showed Xi speaking to assembled executives pictured from behind and aligned in rows before him. The images prompted a scramble by investors to see who was in and out among top business leaders.Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and BYD's Wang Chuanfu sat directly in front of Xi, images showed, seats of honour for national champions in electric vehicles and chip development.Shares of Baidu dropped more than 8%, making it the largest loser on the Hang Seng index, after no top executive was spotted. Founders of Baidu and ByteDance were among those who did not attend, two sources familiar with the matter said.Neither company's officials immediately responded to requests for comment.On Friday, Reuters reported, citing sources, that Xi planned to chair a business meeting. Xi had been expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses amid the China-U.S. technology rivalry, the sources had said.Xi delivered a speech after listening to executives on Monday, official news agency Xinhua said, but gave no details of his remarks.'SPUTNIK MOMENT' AND DANCING ROBOTSIn addition to DeepSeek, whose AI breakthrough has been described as a \"Sputnik moment\" for China, other participants showcased recent business success stories with a wide public following in China.Those included Xiaomi's Lei Jun, a celebrity CEO who pushed his smartphone and appliance company into EVs, and Wang Xingxing, founder of Unitree.One of the most popular moments of CCTV's Lunar New Year's gala broadcast featured dozens of Unitree humanoid robots dancing in a spectacle that seemed aimed at Tesla's earlier efforts and showcasing China's homegrown innovation.Other executives present included CATL's Robin Zeng, Meituan's Wang Xing, China Feihe's Leng Youbin and Will Semiconductor founder Yu Renrong, CCTV video showed.Tencent's Pony Ma was also there, two sources familiar with the meeting said.'INJECT CONFIDENCE'Tech shares in Hong Kong have jumped in recent weeks on a combination of optimism about the DeepSeek AI breakthrough and a thawing of authorities' approach to internet giants.The Hang Seng technology index hit a three-year high in morning trade on Monday. It slipped in volatile afternoon trade and was last down 1.3%.Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018, six years after he came to power. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and access to financial backing.Xiaoyan Zhang, a finance professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University, said Monday's meeting was intended to send a similar message about the importance of private industry and to try to \"inject confidence\".\"I think the purpose is to tell them we want to support you. We need you to boost innovation, technological innovation, and we need you to boost consumption,\" Zhang told Reuters.Attendance by Jack Ma, in particular, has the potential to boost confidence, analysts have said.The once high-profile entrepreneur largely withdrew from public life after the IPO of his fintech company Ant was halted by authorities in 2020  a move triggered by a speech he gave that year criticising China's regulatory system.His business empire and the wider technology industry were then targeted by a regulatory crackdown, and his time out of the limelight represented a reversal of fortunes for China's private sector.(Reporting by Beijing and Hong Kong Newsrooms; Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Kevin Krolicki; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Clarence Fernandez)"

Baidu, with its market value now at HK$252.05 billion ($32.4 billion), was the biggest loser on both the Hang Seng Index and Hang Seng Tech Index.Brokers said Baidu's shares had been weak since the morning after it said it would fully connect its search engine to Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek and its proprietary Ernie large language model.\"That implies the company is losing its edge after all these years of taking a leading role through its development of Ernie, suggesting the firm may need to catch up with newcomers like DeepSeek,\" a sales director at a regional brokerage said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.The absence of Baidu executives from the symposium might also lead to speculation the company is losing its important position in the overall market, the sales director added.The meeting with Xi signalled the government's support for China's technology sector after years of regulatory controls as Beijing seeks to boost economic growth and navigate increasingly uncertain relations with the United States.For its part, Baidu has ramped up its push into AI as it seeks to reduce its reliance on advertising revenue from its core search engine business.The company was among the first to launch a ChatGPT-style chatbot in early 2023, following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Baidu has stated that its current version, Ernie 4.0, matches the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4.($1 = 7.7808 Hong Kong dollars)(Reporting By Anne Marie Roantree and Donny Kwok in Hong Kong and Liam Mo in Beijing)"

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "After a period of heavy inflation left quick-service restaurant prices elevated, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) has decided to lean into value meals. In fact, on its recent fourth-quarter earnings call, the company used the word \"value\" or a variation of the word \"affordable\" more than 50 times.When quick-service restaurant pricing competition heats up, McDonald's has a tendency to come out on top due to its large scale and franchise model. Let's dive into the company's most recent results to see if this is a good time to buy the stock.McDonald's overall Q4 results were largely lackluster. The company saw an E.coli scare early in the quarter that caused it to pull its popular Quarter Pounder hamburgers from its menu at some locations. It also led to some large traffic declines, particularly in the U.S. states that were affected. However, the company did a good job of finding the source, its sliced onions, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared the outbreak over by early December.U.S. sales hit their trough in early November after the outbreak and then began to pick up thereafter. Overall, the company's U.S. same-store sales dropped by 1.4% in the quarter, which isn't all that bad considering the foodborne illness outbreak. It noted that it saw a decline in check size, but that there was a slightly positive guest count.International licensed markets, meanwhile, were much stronger, with comparable-store sales climbing by 4.1%. The company credited sales in Japan and the Middle East for the strong results. International company-operated stores saw comparable store sales edge up 0.1%, hurt by some weakness in the U.K.Overall global same-store sales, meanwhile, rose 0.4% compared to a 3.4% increase last year. That was ahead of analyst expectations for a 1% decline in same-store sales, according to StreetAccounts. Overall revenue was flattish on the quarter at $6.39 billion. That fell just shy of the $6.44 billion analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined by 4% to $2.83, but met analyst expectations.Looking ahead, the company said it plans to spend between $3 billion and $3.2 billion this year in new unit development. It plans to open approximately 2,200 restaurants in 2025, with a quarter of them in the U.S. and international operated segments. Meanwhile, it's looking to add 1,000 new restaurants in China. Overall, it's looking for its unit count to grow by slightly more than 4%, with 1,800 net unit additions.It added that it expects its adjusted operating margin to be above the 46.3% level it saw in 2024. However, it expects currency to be around a $0.20 to $0.30 headwind to EPS.McDonald's plans to lean heavily into value this year, starting with the launch of its McValue platform in January in the U.S. In addition, it said it is making further enhancements to its value programs in international markets in the first quarter. It noted that it has seen improvements in value perception in parts of Europe with its 4-euro Happy Meal, while its $5 Meal Deal has been resonating with customers.When asked about the effect on gross margins, it said these deals drive other purchases and that the average check on $5 Meal Deals was above $10. It also said that its Buy 1 Add 1 for $1 promotion has been accretive to overall check transactions.Overall, the company expects a full sales recovery from the E.coli incidents by the start of the second quarter. Meanwhile, it's looking for margins to improve compared to 2024 levels. It also said it has some new menu innovations in store for this year, and that it will continue rolling out its Best Burger initiative, with it expected to be in all the countries it operates in by the end of 2026. This initiative includes small tweaks to how its burgers are assembled and cooked that have been leading to better customer satisfaction scores.McDonald's has done a good job navigating through its E.coli scare, keeping the damage to its sales to a minimum. While the effects could continue into Q1, it looks like it should be an overall quick recovery to get back to normal.Meanwhile, the company is clearly leaning into value at a time when many people have been complaining about quick-service restaurant prices. This is a good move, as the company has historically done well at gaining market share during periods of pricing wars, to the detriment of its fast-food burger competitors. The combination of value meals to drive traffic and new menu items to entice customers into full-price purchases tends to be a good one.The company is also embracing digital orders to expand the reach of its loyalty program and to help drive more sales through personalized offers. It had 175 million active loyalty members at the end of 2024.From a valuation perspective, McDonald's trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of just under 25 times 2025 analyst estimates. That's around historical valuations for the company.Overall, McDonald's should be a solid stock to own over the long term. It's an iconic brand that still has room to continue growing its store base, while also having room to drive growth through digital ordering and its loyalty program, and by embracing its value roots to gain market share.Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and McDonald's wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The prospect of several more weeks of winter after Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow may have your mind fretful about more frosty weather, but that shouldn't distract you from the S&P 500's red-hot performance, which has resulted in the index soaring more than 20%.But not every stock has fared as well. In fact, two software stocks, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) and PTC (NASDAQ: PTC) have headed in the other direction. During the same time period, Adobe and PTC have fallen about 27% and 8%, respectively. This may be disconcerting for current shareholders, but two Fool.com contributors believe now's a great time to either start positions or to bulk up further regarding these two tech leaders.Scott Levine (Adobe): With enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) running rampant, it certainly doesn't feel like there have been a lot of opportunities recently to scoop up leading AI stocks at a discount. Thanks to investors' fears that Adobe's growth prospects are less robust than what they had previously been, shares have plunged over the past year, leaving those on the prowl for inexpensively valued AI stocks with a fortuitous opportunity in Adobe stock.The stock's decline belies the fact that the company reported a strong 2024 performance -- a singularly strong performance that featured a couple of high-water marks. For one, the company reported record revenue of $21.5 billion in 2024, representing 11% year-over-year growth. Plus, with the contribution of a record $2.92 billion generated in the fourth quarter, Adobe reported record 2024 operating cash flow of $8.06 billion.While it's valid to wonder whether Adobe's best growth days are behind it, it's important to recognize the company's strong customer engagement that it had enjoyed at the end of last year -- hardly a sign that the company is losing favor among AI-focused customers.On the company's fourth-quarter 2024 conference call, for example, management singled out customer enthusiasm for Firefly, its generative AI models, noting that \"Firefly powered generations across our tools surpassed 16 billion, with every month this past quarter setting a new record.\"With Adobe stock trading at 25.6 times operating cash flow and 36.5 times trailing earnings, both discounts to their five-year average cash-flow and P/E multiples of 32.6 and 45.8, respectively, now seems like a great time to pick up Adobe, a leading software-as-a-service stock.Lee Samaha (PTC): Computer-aided design and product lifecycle software company PTC disappointed some investors recently with its first-quarter 2025 earnings report. However, if you look deeper, the company is still on a growth trajectory that many would envy.The long-term case for the stock revolves around the increasing adoption of digital technology designing and manufacturing products. PTC's software creates a so-called digital thread that gathers, collates, and analyzes valuable digital information to improve design, production, servicing, and disposal of a product.It's an exciting area, and no one disputes the long-term potential as factories get smarter and look to implement digital technologies.However, the near-term problem is that PTC's end-market customers are struggling with an industrial slowdown, which also holds back PTC's growth. As such, investors get anxious when a company like PTC cuts its full-year revenue and earnings guidance. They get even more skittish when they know that PTC is restructuring its sales organization to focus on selling by industry vertical.That said, the underlying and more critical full-year 2025 guidance numbers were left unchanged. Accounting standards related to revenue recognition can make revenue and earnings hard to predict for companies selling on-premise subscriptions.Instead, it's better to focus on PTC's annual run rate (ARR) metric, defined as the \"annualized value of our portfolio of active subscription software, SaaS, hosting, and support contracts as of the end of the reporting period.\" This metric guides its free-cash-flow (FCF) generation.The good news is management left both guidance numbers unchanged, and now expects 9% to 10% in ARR in constant currency, and $835 million to $850 million in FCF, implying a 14.5% increase at the midpoint.Growing ARR and FCF at those rates in a weak environment is a good result. It indicates the underlying strength of the demand for PTC's software, and the stock's sell-off looks like an excellent buying opportunity.With shares of leading AI stocks frequently trading at premiums to their historic valuations, today's opportunity with Adobe stock offers a favorable circumstance with the company riding strong momentum out of the fourth quarter of 2024. Investors optimistic about the digital transformation of industries should investigate PTC stock more closely, particularly given its recent decline.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "By Sinead Cruise, Lawrence White and Selena LiLONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors in HSBC are backing management attempts to shutter parts of its investment bank, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda fuels hopes for a boom in capital markets activity.Four shareholders, including two of the 20 largest, said last month's decision to axe HSBC's mergers and equity capital markets teams in the Americas and Europe made sense as the bank focuses on its strongest franchises in its core Asian markets.Once a sprawling behemoth spanning more than 100 countries, HSBC has spent the last decade slowly shrinking its global footprint and exiting low-return businesses.As U.S. tariffs threaten to crimp the earnings power of major trade finance providers like HSBC, pressure is mounting on CEO George Elhedery to shift group capital into Asian economies with healthy regional trading prospects that may be less vulnerable to global trade snags, the investors said.\"Geopolitics are making life more difficult for lots of businesses that operate globally,\" said Alex Potter, investment director for European equities at HSBC shareholder abrdn, a top-30 investor.\"Even with multiple purchases over decades, almost no foreign banks have achieved meaningful market share in U.S. equity investment banking,\" he added.Elhedery is set to unveil further details of his vision for HSBC when it reports full-year results on February 21, including cost savings from his restructuring, one bank insider said.Unconfirmed media reports put those savings at between 1.2 billion and 3 billion pounds ($1.5-$3.8 billion), partly achieved through further cuts to management roles and units close to those already scrapped, a second bank insider said.HSBC declined to comment.The bank's London-listed shares are up 11.5% year-to-date, after rising by a fifth in 2024.Sajeer Ahmed, global equities portfolio manager at HSBC investor Aegon Asset Management, said he felt bosses were meticulously analysing each business, with a view to delivering a sustainable return on tangible equity (ROTE) of around 16%.\"Many U.S. banks with a similar return profile are trading at a significantly higher price-to-book multiple,\" he told Reuters.For example, HSBC, with a 19.3% ROTE in the first 9 months of 2024, traded at a multiple of 1.04 on Friday, less than half the 2.16 for Morgan Stanley which returned 18.8% last year.\"The sharp switch to profitability from empire building is Elhedery's attempt to tackle that valuation differential over time,\" Ahmed said.A forecast complied by the bank shows analysts expect full-year profit of $31.6 billion, little changed after a 78% jump to $30.3 billion in 2023.INTERNAL STRIFEThere are reasons for Elhedery to move quickly.The optics of ousting rainmakers and IPO advisors could be harder to manage as 2025 unfolds, with Amrit Shahani, a partner at consulting firm BCG Expand, saying such teams are expected to enjoy double-digit growth on the back of Trump-fuelled deregulation and consolidation this year.Staff in affected businesses are concerned about their jobs, while those in related divisions fear they may be next, denting morale, two more sources at the bank said.\"I don't think this is about having to make a difficult choice between serving China versus serving the West,\" said Alex Marshall, managing partner at strategic growth consultancy CIL.\"Asian capital is a significant growth story. This is a huge prize, and HSBC has done well out of it. Europe's share of global capital flows by contrast is pretty limp.\"(1 British pound = $1.2555)(Additional reporting by Lananh Nyguyen in New York and Amy Jo Crowley in London; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)"

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "For the last two years, technology stocks have been rocking thanks to an overwhelmingly bullish narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Among AI's biggest winners have been software businesses, a theme that I don't see changing anytime soon.Below, I'm going to compare two of the biggest names in enterprise software benefiting from the AI revolution: Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). While each appears well positioned to continue riding the AI wave, I see Palantir as the superior choice for growth investors.Let's dig into how each of these software leaders is affecting the AI sector and assess why I think Palantir will become the bigger company by the end of the year.As of this writing (Feb. 10), Salesforce has a larger market capitalization than Palantir by roughly $52 billion. With that said, the underlying trends shown in the chart below are quite interesting.Check out the difference between how each company's valuation has moved since AI emerged as the next megatrend. Over the last couple of years, Palantir's valuation has expanded significantly. By contrast, Salesforce's price movement has exhibited far more ebbs and flows. As a result, there's a clear convergence seen in the graph below with Palantir's market value starting to encroach on that of Salesforce.Salesforce owns a number of properties including data analytics platform Tableau and messaging tool Slack. The company's prior strategy of acquiring competing businesses and integrating them with the core ecosystem helped build an end-to-end software suite that offers businesses a variety of data-driven applications, but investors eventually grew tired of such an approach.For the last couple of years, Salesforce has been under enormous scrutiny from Wall Street to start delivering more robust revenue acceleration and profit margin expansion excluding inorganic assets purchased through acquisitions.I'll admit that Salesforce has made good on this promise ... for the most part. The issue Salesforce continues to face revolves around consistency. In other words, sometimes the company blows Wall Street's expectations out of the water, while at other times investors are left scratching their heads questioning what is going on in execution.For this reason, I'm not entirely sold that Salesforce is going to dominate its pocket of the AI realm. Specifically, the company's newest area of interest, called agentic AI, faces fierce competition -- namely from Microsoft, a much larger company with a stronger balance sheet.When you add in that Salesforce faces a number of tangential competitors, including Monday.com, HubSpot, Atlassian, Asana, Workday, and more, I'm hard-pressed to see how it navigates amid all of these businesses.On the flip side, Palantir -- which is much smaller than Salesforce in revenue and earnings -- is partnering with the likes of Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Oracle. To me, big tech's decision to work alongside Palantir as opposed to launching competing products represents enormous potential since the company continues to scale up its biggest driver of growth, the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software suite.The chart below illustrates consensus estimates among Wall Street analysts for growth in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) between Salesforce and Palantir.The dichotomy shown above is obvious: Wall Street is estimating far less acceleration for revenue and earnings for Salesforce compared to Palantir over the next two years. My interpretation of these forecasts is that analysts may see more competitive headwinds for Salesforce when compared to Palantir.To be fair, this should be expected to some degree. Salesforce is a much larger enterprise than Palantir, and so at some point the company's growth profile is going to mature.However, I have not fully bought into that idea because AI is supposed to represent transformative opportunities for businesses of all sizes. Given the mundane growth profile for Salesforce, I'm wondering if Wall Street shares my suspicion that AI may not be as influential for the company as it could be for other software businesses, such as Palantir.For these reasons, I would not be surprised to continue witnessing some inconsistent trends in Salesforce throughout this year (and maybe even longer). By contrast, Palantir's prospects look strong, and I think investors could continue cheering on the stock -- propelling its valuation even higher during 2025.I think there could be some contraction in Salesforce's market cap and even more expansion in Palantir's, thereby tightening the gap between the two companies even further. If this happens, I think Palantir will emerge as the more valuable business by the end of the year.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Roper Technologies (NASDAQ: ROP) is a diversified technology company that has delivered total returns of roughly 3,740% since 2000. These returns are six times larger than the S&P 500's over the same time, making Roper one of the most successful stocks in the index.Despite this incredible run, the average person probably hasn't heard of Roper or its portfolio of roughly 28 independent businesses. Management beautifully summarized the company's operations in its 2023 Investor Day presentation, stating: \"We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche, market-leading technology businesses.\"By targeting defensible niche markets, Roper has become a cash-generating machine that has raised its dividend payments for 27 consecutive years, growing its quarterly payouts 36-fold over that time.While these figures may leave you thinking that the best is already behind the company, its recent fourth-quarter results show that the good times could keep on rolling -- and investors should get to know Roper.Twenty years ago, Roper's five business categories were radio frequency, water, energy, research/medical, and industrial niche markets. Nowadays, things look pretty different, as the company has shifted its focus from industrial applications to technology-first solutions.Following the sale of its industrial business in 2022, Roper is now a decentralized technology and software-focused behemoth that operates through the following three business segments:Application Software (56% of sales): Roper's largest unit serves end markets like acute care healthcare, education, government contracting, property and casualty insurance, legal, and utilities. One of the company's largest businesses in this segment is Deltek. Not only do 98 of the 100 largest federal contractors use Deltek's project-management solutions, but over 10,000 small businesses are powered by its products as well.Network Software (20% of sales): This segment helps with areas such as construction data, food supply chains, freight matching, life insurance, media and entertainment, and post-acute healthcare. The company's DAT and Loadlink Technologies subsidiaries combine to form North America's largest freight spot market, providing an array of solutions such as freight matching.Technology-Enabled Products (24% of sales): Roper's final unit serves its oldest end markets, with solutions for the water and medical industries. The biggest business line in this unit is Neptune Technology Group, which provides automatic meter readings and advanced metering infrastructure to document data from 72 million meters monthly.Through this technology-facing portfolio of businesses, 75% of Roper's sales now come from vertical software solutions (think of Toast for restaurants as a classic example of vertical software). By targeting these industry-specific software verticals, over 70% of the company's sales are high-margin and recurring, providing stable and robust profitability for investors.In transforming from an industrial juggernaut to a decentralized holdings company of vertical software providers, Roper has seen its profitability balloon steadily.Even better, all of this improved profitability has flowed all the way down to the company's bottom line -- precisely, its free cash flow (FCF). Over the last decade, Roper has grown its FCF by an impressive 22% annually.This FCF growth is critical since the company uses it to fund its ambitions as a serial acquirer. After snapping up dozens of businesses across the 2000s, Roper has actually spent more on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) since 2005 than it has generated in FCF.After growing revenue and FCF by 14% and 16% in the fourth quarter this year -- despite still integrating two recent acquisitions worth $3.6 billion -- Roper and its acquisitive ways continue to fire on all cylinders. Best yet for investors, management states that it has $5 billion in funds available for new acquisition targets, which should pave the way for further growth.Despite its heavy spending on M&A, Roper has grown its dividend payments by 20% annually over the last decade. Even with this quickly rising payout, the company only uses 14% of its FCF to make its payments. This ample wiggle room to continue increasing its dividend payments, combined with its track record of consistently boosting payouts each year, makes Roper a promising dividend growth stock.While its 0.5% dividend yield may seem too minuscule to worry about (especially since it hasn't been above 1% in over 20 years), Roper has handsomely rewarded long-term investors. Had an investor been patient enough to hold from 2000 until today, they would now receive a 19% dividend payment annually, compared to their original cost basis.Thanks to its dividend track record, ballooning profitability, and focus on acquisitions in high-margin verticals, Roper Technologies is high on my watchlist of stocks to add to next. Trading at 27 times FCF, it looks like a perfect example of a premium business trading at a fair price.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Its stake in Alibaba also decreased by 25% during the same period. Despite this reallocation, JD.com and Alibaba, together with Baidu Inc., were still a part of Scions top holdings.The moves came amid a volatile stretch for Chinese stocks, when investors showed signs of wavering commitment after Beijing rolled out a stimulus blitz in late September. The governments efforts sparked a frenetic rally into early October, but the momentum faded in the following months amid disappointment over the scale of fiscal stimulus, a weak economic outlook and a property crisis. Alibabas US-listed shares fell 20% in the fourth quarter, while JD.com declined 13%.Scion didnt cut its stake in all of its China investments. It started a new position on PDD Holdings Inc., a rival of Alibaba in Chinas e-commerce sector, with 75,000 shares. The firms holdings in Baidu Inc. remained unchanged.This investment was worth $40.9 million as of Dec. 31, representing 53% of Scions total equity holdings, data show. That was a reduction from about 65% in the previous three months.The bearish options bought by Scion in the third quarter that would provide downside protection were longer in place as of Dec. 31, according to the filing.Chinas market has been on a stronger footing to start the year, with some of equity benchmarks outperforming US and European peers.

Its equity market has added more than $1.3 trillion in total value in just the past month amid such reallocations. The MSCI China Index is on track to outperform its Indian counterpart for a third-straight month, the longest such streak in two years.

        "content": "For the last couple of years, the stock market has rallied on an unwaveringly positive narrative surrounding the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI). The momentum that's fueled technology stocks in particular carried into 2025 -- until about two weeks ago, when the party music suddenly stopped out of nowhere.An AI start-up out of China called DeepSeek released a model that is similar to those built by ChatGPT or Perplexity. The concern, however, is that DeepSeek claims to have unlocked new methods to train AI models by using older, seemingly less sophisticated architectures. As such, investors have become worried that the hundreds of billions that U.S. technology businesses are pouring into expensive chipware may have been an overzealous move. Unsurprisingly, stock prices for big tech, and in particular the \"Magnificent Seven,\" have been cratering in epic fashion.Nevertheless, one prominent tech investor doesn't seem dissuaded by the DeepSeek drama. Of course, I'm talking about Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood -- who almost always seems to exhibit a sense of optimism when it comes to new technologies.I'll reveal which Magnificent Seven stock Wood just scooped up and make the case for why I think her decision is a savvy move.One of the nice things about Ark Invest is that the fund publishes its trading history daily. Usually, investors need to wait until the end of the quarter to see which stocks institutional investors bought and sold. Wood's transparency is helpful, as it provides investors with a real-time glimpse into what stocks she's monitoring.Around Jan. 24 was when I first started hearing chirps about DeepSeek and began seeing some headlines publish on financial news programming. The chart shows that shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) clearly started to slide in the final days of January -- as more news about DeepSeek started to break.Well, Wood took note of these moves. Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 7, Wood added over 120,000 shares worth more than $28 million to five of her exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including ARK Next Generation Internet, ARK Innovation, ARK Fintech Innovation, ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics, and ARK Space Exploration & Innovation.DateAmazon Shares Purchased by Ark InvestJan. 277,461Jan. 2841,338Feb. 6153Feb. 772,457Data source: Ark Invest.In addition to the initial sell-off influenced by DeepSeek, Wood doubled down on her conviction in Amazon, as evidenced by her purchases following the company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings call on Feb. 6.Since reporting earnings, Amazon stock has dropped again -- primarily due to the company's hefty capital expenditures (capex) plan for 2025, which is forecast to be in excess of $100 billion. I think some investors have reservations about this level of spend due to DeepSeek's initial claims. For these reasons, some investors appear to be souring on big tech at the moment.As an investor in Amazon, I am not personally worried about how much the company is investing in AI infrastructure. Rather, I am more focused on where the company is spending.During the company's recent earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the \"the vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS.\"When you look at the financial profile, it's hard to argue with Jassy's vision. Over the last two years, Amazon has invested $8 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic -- which the company has integrated tightly with its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In this time, AWS has accelerated both revenue and profit growth, now becoming a business generating more than $100 billion in annual sales while generating nearly 50% growth in operating income.Amazon's investments in AI infrastructure are already bearing fruit. For this reason, I see the company's 2025 capex budget as a good sign for more growth to come down the road.Nevertheless, Amazon currently trades at a price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) multiple of 75 -- well below its five-year average of 104.I think many investors are honing in too closely on Amazon's spending and not giving management enough credit for the growth the company has already witnessed over the last two years in particular (since AI became the main focal point).I think Wood's idea to buy the dip on Amazon right now is incredibly smart. Investors with a long-term time horizon might want to consider following Wood's lead and scoop up some shares of the company while the stock remains at a historical discount.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-stock-buy-now-143000041.html",
        "published": "2025-02-15T14:30:00Z",
        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Despite not capturing the same level of market attention as some of its mega-cap technology sector peers, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has quietly emerged as a major winner in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. A surge in demand for the company's infrastructure solutions and broader software applications has powered shares to a fantastic 53% return in the past year.There's a lot to like about this cloud computing giant, but can the recent rally keep going? Let's discuss whether Oracle stock is a buy right now.The data-intensive requirements for companies building out their AI capabilities have made Oracle's ecosystem of products and services more important than ever. This includes Oracle's hybrid cloud solutions, spanning infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. The integrated platform represents a critical component of the AI value chain, enabling data storage, scalable computing for model training, and seamless deployment of AI applications.The growth trends have been solid. For Oracle's last reported fiscal 2025 second quarter (for the period ended Nov. 30, 2024), total revenue climbed by 9% year over year, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was up 10% from the prior-year quarter. Within the top line, the bigger story was the 52% increase in cloud infrastructure revenue, reflecting what management described as a record level of AI demand, including with an increasing rate of new customers.The financial metric that stands out is Oracle's remaining performance obligation (RPO), which reached a record $97 billion, up 49% from last year. This indicator, a measure of the contract backlog not yet recognized as revenue, provides some confidence for a growth runway. For the year ahead, management is guiding for double-digit revenue growth, with an acceleration expected into fiscal 2026.The ongoing shift toward more value-added high-tech services should also help lift margins and earnings. That outlook is reflected in Wall Street analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo! Finance, which forecast Oracle's EPS growth to outpace the sales momentum with a 10.6% increase this year and 14.1% next year.Metric2025 Estimate2026 EstimateRevenue$57.7 billion$65.0 billionRevenue growth (YOY)9%12.6%Adjusted EPS$6.15$7.02Adjusted EPS growth (YOY)10.6%14.1%Data source: Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year.Perhaps the most important development for Oracle this year is its role within the Stargate Initiative. The AI infrastructure project, announced by the new Trump administration, aims to maintain the leadership role of the United States in cutting-edge technology through policy and regulatory support that recognizes its strategic importance to national security.Funded through an initial planned investment of $100 billion by the Japanese holding group SoftBank, the joint venture includes Oracle and OpenAI and is focused on the development and construction of data centers to power advanced AI models. Oracle stands to benefit significantly as a key technology provider. It's partnering with OpenAI, which has committed to shifting its AI workloads to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a new growth driver over the next several years.The Stargate Initiative may go a long way toward helping to reaffirm Oracle's previously issued financial targets, incremental to its organic opportunities. The company expects to reach more than $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, which is nearly double the $53 billion result in fiscal 2024. Oracle also expects EPS to accelerate above a 20% annual growth rate in the next five years.What I like about Oracle is its broader exposure to high-level themes in technology as a global leader in the ongoing digital transformation.The company remains a major player in cybersecurity and data privacy, while its flagship Autonomous Database platform, with multiple industry-specific solutions, is now being used with AI and machine learning to deliver even greater productivity benefits. That layer of diversification beyond cloud infrastructure is what makes the stock a compelling investment. With the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times its consensus 2026 EPS, Oracle could prove to be a bargain if the expected growth acceleration materializes through its ability to capture market share as a high-performance hyperscaler.Overall, Oracle is well-positioned to continue rewarding shareholders as it executes its profitable growth strategy, and the stock deserves a spot within diversified investor portfolios with upside in 2025.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "DraftKings CEO Jason Robins emphasizes that users should take betting strictly for its entertainment value, but many sports bettors think differently.While more Americans choose to bet on sports as a way to invest, DraftKings warns against it.Its an entertainment product. Its not something that we recommend people looking at as an investment, CEO Jason Robins told Fortune.Many bettors feel otherwise. A report from NerdWallet this month said 31% of sports bettors perceive gambling as an investment. This is up from 14% in last years survey.The latest survey also found that the most common reason Americans bet on sports was to make extra money (65%), edging past gambling for enjoyment (61%) and doing it to have fun with friends and family (53%).NerdWallet said the average sports bettor spent $3,284 in the past 12 months, and 40% of them say theyve had net gains in the past 12 months, suggesting the rest did not.Most people over the long term, you know, they understand that theyre likely to lose money, Robins said. So I think that it's much more of, 'I enjoy this and it entertains me and it's worth me spending on in the same way that I would spend on, you know, anything I find entertaining, going out to the movies or going out to dinner or whatever.Experts emphasize that gambling on sports as an investment vehicle is a slippery slope.Sports betting is more akin to day trading than long-term investing, Stephen Shapiro, a sports and entertainment professor at the University of South Carolina, told Fortune.Typically, risk is evaluated and considered more heavily in investing, and although there is risk involved in both activities, it can be accounted for in more depth within the context of investments, he said.NerdWallet personal finance expert Elizabeth Ayoola said there isnt anything inherently wrong with betting on sportsas long as it doesnt hinder personal finance objectives. Roughly 45% of sports bettors say they rarely make bets more than $20, according to the survey.While making money off sports betting is possible, NerdWallet notes that its risky, and a safer investment strategy is to invest in a low-cost, well-diversified index fund.Meanwhile, DraftKings also reported earnings on Thursday. Full-year revenue grew 30% to $4.77 billion. Losses in 2024 narrowed to $507 million from $802 million from a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company swung to a profit of $181 million from a loss of $151 million.Monthly unique players averaged 4.8 million at the end of the year, up 36% from a year ago.Along with sports betting, the company offers traditional casino games, online lottery, and daily fantasy sports. DraftKings Sportsbook makes up the companys most lucrative revenue stream, allowing users to bet on sports within professional and collegiate athletics.DraftKings stock has tripled since going public via a SPAC merger in 2020, and so far in 2025, it's already up 44%.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "content": "If youre looking for a fast, commission-free path to stock investment, Robinhood Markets (HOOD) is a platform both traders and investors should consider. In recent years, the disruptively brash platform has courted both retail investors and pros alike. With a steady influx of new investors entering the market, Robinhood is well-positioned to maintain its user base and revenue growth over time. However, despite the platform currently enjoying a flurry of new activity and, in turn, sturdy revenues, its valuation leaves me feeling neutral.Leverage the power of TipRanks' Smart Score, a data-driven tool to help you uncover top performing stocks and make informed investment decisions.Monitor your stock picks and compare them to top Wall Street Analysts' recommendations with  Your Smart PortfolioRobinhood shook up the retail trading sector by slashing trading costs even further than the likes of Charles Shwab and E-Trade could. Moreover, as the companys name suggests, Robinhood wants to disrupt the highly gated community of financial investing and introduce it to the common man. The retail-investor-focused marketing pitch is opening the door to stock investing for swathes of retail investors. Its intuitive platform now supports a wide range of financial instruments, including cryptocurrency, futures, and index optionsallowing many users to manage their entire portfolio in one place.The disruptive no-cost broker is making another bold move: launching a low-cost advisory service with a minimum investment of just $50 and an annual fee of 0.25%. This initiative can potentially foster a more financially literate retail investor base.In FY2024, Robinhood delivered impressive financial growth, with net revenue soaring 58% year-over-year and assets under custody climbing 88%. Even more striking, adjusted EBITDA surged 167%a clear sign of the companys strengthening profitability. Given these results, its no surprise the market reacted bullishly to HOODs latest earnings report earlier this week despite the stocks forward P/E exceeding 50.Robinhoods management projects another year of strong double-digit revenue growth in 2025, reinforcing confidence in its long-term trajectory. With results exceeding projections on a regular basis, the big question now is whether Robinhood can sustain its trading volumes and market expansionor if valuation concerns and bullish fatigue will finally catch up to this plucky financial liberator.Robinhood faces competition from platforms like eToro, Webull, Moomoo, and Lightyear. However, its first-mover advantage has secured a dominant market position, providing HOOD investors with a strong moat. As things stand, the company is capped at ~$60 billion, which is no mean feat for a broker specializing in retail order flow. Still, any market missteps by HOODs management could weaken the companys people-power edge over time.Robinhoods cryptocurrency segment has seen remarkable growth, with a 700% year-over-year increase in crypto transaction revenue in Q4 2024, totaling $358 million. This surge is further bolstered by the companys strategic acquisition of Bitstamp, the worlds longest-running crypto exchange, for approximately $200 million. This move is anticipated to expand Robinhoods global reach and attract a broader base of dedicated crypto investors, potentially driving significant growth in transaction-based revenue over the next decade.Another interesting angle with HOOD is its exposure to market themes that could potentially become very lucrative later this year. More specifically, HOOD is currently developing services that are presently being balked at by regulators, such as offering crypto and leveraged stock trading to retail investors. However, the tides could shift with Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and a fleet of tech pioneers leading the charge to advance society into tomorrows world. It is conceivable to see cryptocurrencies legitimized en masse via a pro-Trump SEC chief, for investing rules and regulations to be drastically relaxed, for AI-powered innovations to be fast-tracked, and for speculative market activity (including volatility) to rise as a result.In addition, there is the specter of further geopolitical ramifications on an international scale, with DeepSeek, Alibaba (BABA), and other Chinese disruptors adding further volatility to markets. The above would be a massive boon for HOODs balance sheet and its shareholders.Although some label Robinhood as a meme stock, I believe that overlooks its solid business foundation and competent management. However, the companys revenue has fluctuated over the years without consistent growth. HOOD bulls will point to reinvigorated metrics in 2024 and will point to the companys next earnings call on 7 May as a milestone that could prove all the naysayers wrong. Considering that reported figures lag market activity, Mays figures will likely be impacted by elevated market volatility due to Trumps market entry, so HOOD bulls will expect a strong report. Brokers of all sorts and varieties blossom when markets are volatile and waste away in sideways trade.Additionally, Robinhood only turned profitable this year, and if it fails to sustain its earnings trajectory, investors should brace for intermittent stock price declines. Moreover, retail trading flows are notoriously erratic, with the average duration of a novice investor still around the 6-month mark. Retail investors burn out all too fast, and replacing old clients with new ones is getting costlier.Therefore, its important to be cautious with Robinhood stock. The price-to-sales ratio is at all-time highs, while the 14-day Relative Strength Index is at almost 75, a technical signal that the stock is overbought and is ripe for a pullback.As a value investor, I consider this stock overbought despite a strong FY2024. Buying stock in a great company at a low price following a setback is preferable to buying stock in a great company when its trading close to all-time highs. The market tends to overvalue stocks during times of strength, and HOOD could be a good case in point  assuming the stock delivers for investors long-term.Robinhood Markets (HOOD) has a consensus Strong Buy rating on Wall Street. Its average price target is $68.87 per share, suggesting an almost 7% upside over the next 12 months. This is based on 13 Buy, four Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months.While this indicates a solid return potential, I typically seek an annual return of 15% or more for a Buy rating, so I remain neutral despite the bullish sentiment from other analysts.Robinhood could be quite a good long-term investment, but at current prices, its just not worth paying to find outespecially when considering the companys operations and sector. The market is too excited after the companys Q4 earnings results to realize just how seasonal and gyratory retail brokerages can be. Buying in at toppy levels could leave investors long the high and then waiting for months, hoping for a scratch.Smart money tends to buy in strategically, thereby transferring wealth from the poor (uninitiated) to the rich (experienced). It is somewhat ironic that the very thing Robinhood wants to help change (systematic wealth transfer among financial insiders that leave out the common man) is the thing that could occur throughout 2025 to Robinhood clients and HOOD investors alike.Savvy investors would pause for thought and wait for better levels before committing to this stock. My personal line in the sand as to when I think its advantageous to be a HOOD bull is when the companys price-to-sales ratio falls below 15. With a current ratio of 19.58, HOOD is not too far off reaching my mark. All things considered, HOOD could be a superb buy-the-dip opportunity later this year.Disclosure"

To qualify, Q1 2025 earnings must be high enough to offset losses from the previous three quartersa goal that could be achieved thanks to the adoption (now mandatory) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) digital asset accounting rule.The FASB rule change requires companies to recognize bitcoin (BTC) holdings at fair value, meaning price gains will flow through to the bottom line (as would price declines). Prior to this rule, corporate digital asset holders were required to account for holdings at their weakest levels. Strategy, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2024 still valued its bitcoin at less than $16,000 per token, leading to a $1 billion impairment loss even as bitcoin closed the year at about $94,000.According to an analysis by Richard Hass on X, assuming Strategy holdings don't change between now and March 31, bitcoin must close the first quarter above $96,337 for the company to meet the positive trailing 12-month earnings requirement. Based on Q4 2024 earnings of -$671 million in net income MSTR requires $1.113B in Q1 2025 earnings to produce positive earnings in the prior four quarters and become eligible for S&P 500,\" he wrote. \"Based on MSTR's current treasury of 478,740 BTC, the required BTC price on March 31 to achieve this is $96,337.If bitcoin prices remain strong and MSTR continues accumulating tokens, S&P 500 inclusion is within reach. Said Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer:MSTRs adoption of the amended FASB guidance strengthens its case for S&P 500 inclusion. Given its outperformance of every current index constituent over four years, exclusion would be surprising.While joining the Nasdaq-100 was significant, the S&P 500 is the holy grail,\" continued Palmer.\" Inclusion would validate its Bitcoin strategy, as all S&P 500 index funds would hold MSTR shares, indirectly exposing investors to Bitcoin.

        "source": "Fortune",
        "content": "Berkshire Hathaways latest financial disclosures, eagerly awaited by investors and Warren Buffett stans, show moves in bank stocks, energy, and food and beverage companies. Some are believed to be investment choices made by Buffett himself, while other changes are often attributed to deputies who invest relatively smaller stakes.The future might be lit. Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, known for its investments in stocks that generate stable, reasonable returns, has boosted its stakes in companies such as Dominos Pizza, Pool Corp., and Constellation Brands, which produces alcoholic beverages. So, a pool party in the backyard with hot pizza and cold beers? Check.A comparison of the past two quarterly reports disclosing Berkshire Hathaways holdings showed that some of the smaller stakes in the portfolio underwent some notable changes in recent months. Pool Corp., which previously saw a boost during the pandemic when people wanted to swim in their backyards, saw the value of its position increase from about $152 million to $204 million. Similarly, the value of the Dominos Pizza stake increased from about $549 million to $1 billion, while Berkshire initiated a significant stake valued at about $1.2 billion in Constellation Brands, maker of Modelo, Pacifico, and Corona.The filings dont indicate which portfolio manager invested what stock, but two scholars of Buffetts investment style said the pizza and beer choices were likely made by either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Combs is an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway and the CEO of Geico, while Weschler is an investment manager at Berkshire. Todd and Ted oversee relatively smaller investment portfolios and Buffett has granted both autonomy.Market observers have fixed a gimlet eye on Berkshires portfolio holdings even more so lately because Berkshire is sitting on a pile of cash valued at more than $300 billion. In this latest round, Berkshire held its $75 billion stake in Apple and trimmed its stakes in Bank of America, Citigroup, and Capital One Financial.As for pools, Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, noted that a lot of the population has moved south as finance and tech companies have expanded their footprints in the region.There are a lot of swimming pools in Texas and Florida, he told Fortune, adding that the investments look like they were executed by Combs and Weschler.Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management, said Dominos Pizza has been a solid growth business, even though its not under the radar by any means. In addition, the stock previously tumbled after the company announced fewer store openings, but it has since recovered. It represents a steady growth opportunity and seems to be a pretty reasonable investment, he said.The size of the Constellation Brands stake, $1.2 billion, indicates it might be Buffett himself making the investment, explained Pollock. Its another steady growth business despite headwinds from legalized marijuana and hard seltzers, he said. However, Constellation Brands has a portfolio of well-known names like Corona, Modelo, Meiomi, and Kim Crawford, which often appeals to Buffett, he said.The value investors famed annual letter to shareholders is due later this month, and investors are likely to scour it for information about its recent investments.In addition to the other moves, Berkshire sold off its entire stake in retailer Ulta Beauty. Smead said the old adage goes, Men are visual and women are verbal and thats why men lie and women wear makeup. Smeads firm is holding Ulta because young teens are heavily interested in social mediaand makeup is a big part of the phenomenon. Secondly, malls are the social center for teens and tweens again, which is where they go to take pictures to add to their social media profiles.Thats where they go to see other teens, and its also where they go to take a picture they can put up on social media, said Smead And, again, makeup is connected to that.Smeads estimation was that Combs and Weschler likely decided there was another stock they wanted to invest in more than Ulta.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "published": "2025-02-15T16:47:00Z",
        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Tariffs and their impact on financial markets are the talk of the town right now, and it's no surprise why, given the new administration's intense interest in using tariffs as a tool of trade policy. Trade affects nearly every element of the economy, and it even has the potential to impact the cryptocurrency sector, including leading coins like XRP (CRYPTO: XRP).But, contrary to most people's expectations, tariffs are not necessarily totally detrimental, even to coins focused on international money transfers like XRP. There isn't any guarantee that there's a tariff-driven upside in store, though there are at least three ways in which it could be possible. Let's explore each and put them into context so that you'll appreciate how they might change your opinion on whether to buy, sell, or hold XRP.When tariffs are implemented, trade can be disrupted. When trade is disrupted, the direction and volume of the flow of money across borders also changes. For key players in the financing of international trade, like financial institutions, those changes can be detrimental, as they make money by lending to the businesses that produce goods and conduct trade.XRP might not be able to help those financial institutions to prop up their sagging top lines in the event of trade disruptions caused by tariffs. But it could also help them to drive down their costs of transferring money across borders, because that's one of its main use cases and drivers of adoption.The idea here is that newly injured companies might prefer to start using XRP to soften the blow on their bottom lines, as doing so would enable them to stop paying hefty international money transfer fees on the business they have left after tariffs are implemented. And that'd drive more demand for XRP in the near term. Then, it's also possible to imagine a future in which trade rebounds, and those same institutions continue to use XRP, especially if there's no cheaper or faster alternative.So, it's possible for tariffs to stimulate some long-term growth of the coin, even if it isn't a sure thing.One impact of tariffs is that it tends to make a country's currency more scarce among international holders. Essentially, if there's a new tax on imports, the foreign producers of those imports tend to experience reduced demand. Therefore, they make fewer transactions and end up with less of the importing country's currency. With less of the currency circulating externally, each outstanding unit is worth slightly more.When each outstanding unit of a currency is worth more, it effectively becomes more expensive for external holders to purchase goods from the currency's issuing country, assuming prices don't change. So they are likely to seek alternative ways of purchasing goods using weaker currencies, where they are more likely to get a better deal.Now, imagine a world in which purchasers flock to XRP to settle their trade payments instead of the U.S. dollar. That would make sense for them to do, as it's easily transferable across borders and is exchangeable for a variety of different fiat currencies. It wouldn't enable them to skip paying the tariffs, but it'd soften the blow of purchasing goods from the U.S.Plus, holders of XRP in this scenario might actually see their asset increase in value from demand stimulated by other players transitioning their trade transactions from U.S. dollars to the coin. Unlike with dollars, such a value gain is not a problem from the perspective of those doing international trade.However, investors should keep in mind that a stronger dollar could just as easily discourage investors from holding XRP, as they might calculate their return would be higher simply by retaining dollars rather than cryptocurrencies of any sort.Financial institutions need to keep their assets hedged against all manner of disruption, including that caused by trade flows changing due to tariffs. Many major banks already hold hedge assets like gold, but they're always on the lookout for other safe havens that could protect the value of their portfolios.XRP is a natural fit to be one of those assets. While it's true that it's quite volatile, as most cryptocurrencies are, an increasing number of banks and other financial institutions already need to hold it to process their international money transfers. Holding more of it would be convenient, and it might even offer them some additional upside.On the other hand, if tariffs cause a domestic or global recession such that there is meaningfully less demand for internationally produced goods, there does not have much chance for XRP to retain all of its value today. So keep an eye on economic indicators to see if the investment thesis for buying the coin will be resilient in the face of more serious disruption.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "published": "2025-02-16T23:17:00Z",

        "content": "The S&P 500 has risen about 20% over the past 12 months, which is a very strong performance. Cava Group's (NYSE: CAVA) stock price has rallied 160% over the same span. There's a lot to digest about that eye-popping share price advance when you consider the buy, sell, or hold call on this upstart restaurant concept.Let's start with the good news: Cava is a Mediterranean-themed restaurant that uses an assembly line-style preparation system. It cooks the food in a kitchen behind the counter, so customers know it is freshly made. And the assembly line allows customers to fine-tune their choice to their specific taste preferences.This is, basically, what Chipotle Mexican Grill does, too, only with a Mexican theme. Chipotle has grown massively over the years and, despite some recent price weakness, has been a huge winner for investors.To put a number on that, Chipotle's shares have risen 340% over the past decade, while the S&P 500 index has risen around 190%. Investors are betting that Cava is the next Chipotle. And there's good reason to think that, given that Cava only operated around 350 restaurants at the end of the third quarter of 2024.Chipotle operates more than 3,700 restaurants. If Cava's concept remains attractive to consumers, there could be a huge growth opportunity ahead. With same-store sales of 18% in the third quarter of 2024, the concept does, indeed, appear to be very hot right now.So the reason to buy Cava is that you believe it can continue to expand aggressively, perhaps achieving similar long-term results to Chipotle.The problem here is that investors are already pricing a lot of good news into Cava's stock price. That massive price advance over the past 12 months is the first indication of this fact, but there's also the price-to-earnings ratio.Chipotle has a P/E of roughly 50x. That's very high, but it actually pales in comparison to Cava's over 300x P/E ratio. For comparison, the S&P 500's average P/E is 23.It is entirely possible that Cava will continue to grow its business at a breakneck pace. But even the slightest sign of weakness could lead investors to dump the stock, given the lofty valuation. In fact, the company could continue to perform strongly, and the stock could still fall if momentum-driven investors decide to move on to another story stock.If valuation matters to you, you won't want to buy Cava. And if you own it, you might want to consider taking some profits. It is unusual for stocks to have P/Es as high as Cava's for long periods of time, with stock price declines a frequent reason for the P/E falling back to lower levels.That said, if you own Cava, it might be hard to justify selling it. While the stock is expensive, the opportunity remains robust. And management is executing very well right now, aggressively opening new locations while, at the same time, keeping sales at existing locations high. If the restaurant chain can continue to resonate with customers, there's no reason to believe it won't grow into that lofty P/E ratio.If you decide to stick it out, however, make sure to track same-store sales closely. It is unlikely that Cava will be able to sustain 18% forever. But even if it can manage to achieve half that level, it will be a standout performance in an industry where low single digits are considered a solid outcome. The big takeaway, however, is that you may need to react quickly if the story changes, given the good news that investors have already priced into the shares.Or you could just hold on and not do anything. As the chart shows, Chipotle has suffered through a few massive drawdowns even as it has helped investors build wealth over the long term. It would have taken an iron stomach to sit through multiple 50%-plus stock price declines, but such drops aren't uncommon when you are looking at young, fast-growing companies. To stick it out with Cava through this kind of volatility, however, you'll want to make sure you really (really!) believe in the strength of its food concept.Value investors won't like Cava, given its lofty valuation. Income investors won't like Cava since it doesn't pay a dividend. Growth investors are the group that may like this stock. But even then, there's the valuation to contend with, which is extreme by just about any measure.So really, Cava is most appropriate for aggressive growth investors. And even then there's a bit of buyer beware, since the market is clearly highly enthusiastic about the stock today. Share price turbulence is highly likely.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A potential encounter this week between President Xi Jinping and e-commerce icon Jack Ma, coming after a blistering run by tech shares, could be the next catalyst to extend the rally in Chinas stocks.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayProminent entrepreneurs including Ma have been invited to meet the nations top leaders, people familiar with the matter said last week. The potential show of support for the private sector coincides with the recent surge in equities in Hong Kong, driven by growing capabilities in artificial intelligence.The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 4.1% on Friday to its highest since February 2022, exceeding an October peak spurred by a stimulus blitz. A tech gauge in Hong Kong entered a bull market earlier this month, fueled by Chinese startup DeepSeeks AI model thats hailed as a game-changer.Such a high-profile endorsement sends a clear message of support from Chinas government, which views the tech sector as a future driver of economic growth, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea.One major driver of the rally is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., whose Hong Kong-listed shares gained 6.3% on Friday, contributing to a surge of almost 60% since Jan. 13. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. The options market is pricing in a 7.6% move in Alibaba shares after the results, compared with an average 4.8% after the last eight quarterly reports.Some investors say the rally is overcrowded and stretched, but Xis support would be a boost of confidence to the $16 trillion Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets that have enjoyed steady gains since mid-January.The recent developments align with our expectation of a short-term trading opportunity in the Chinese stock market, rather than signaling a structural shift, said Nenad Dinic, an equity strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. Nevertheless, without fresh catalysts from earnings, liquidity flows, or policy signals, the risk of a pullback is increasing.A meeting involving Xi and Ma can be a pivotal turning point for Alibaba since Beijing spiked Ant Group Co.s initial public offering at the 11th hour, halting what would have been the worlds biggest IPO, and marking the start of a regulatory campaign to rein in the sector that had grown perhaps too large and powerful for comfort. It would also send a powerful signal that Chinas Communist Party is adopting a more supportive stance toward private-sector companies.Crystal-Clear MessageHaving Jack Ma in particular would provide a symbolic end to the tech-sector crackdown, which essentially started with him back in 2020, said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong. In practice, the crackdown has been over for a while now. But the optics of Xi telling Ma and other tech leaders to go forth and prosper would send a crystal-clear message that the governments stance has been completely reversed.China is well aware that innovation is the key driver for productivity growth. Xi has continuously pushed for new productive forces amid the US curbs on high-end chips to China. Thats only prompted Beijing to redouble efforts at self-sufficiency in cutting-edge technology.The valuation of the tech index doesnt appear frothy, given that the Hang Seng Tech gauge is trading at 18.2 times forward earnings, compared to 44.9 times four years ago.Chinese equities have been trading at extremely depressed valuations with most risks well discussed and reflected in the prices, said Sandy Pei, a senior portfolio manager for China equities at Federated Hermes. The DeepSeek event has acted as a catalyst, boosting sentiment around Chinese equities. Despite recent performance, the market remains attractively valued.DeepSeek has effectively boosted investor sentiment in Chinas tech sector, and the rally has been spreading beyond just tech into other sectors, including electric vehicle makers and health-care companies. Thats quite the opposite from what many Chinese investors have experienced in recent years, waiting for the government to boost the stock market, whether through stimulus roll-out or via trading purchases by ETFs known to be favored by the so-called national team.--With assistance from Lucille Liu, Henry Ren and Cecile Vannucci.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek rocked the tech world last month when it said that its AI model was on par with top North American models despite costing a fraction of the price. It raised questions about whether spending on AI has become excessive, as many tech companies plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on building out their AI capabilities.But the biggest concern may not necessarily be related to cost for these tech companies. The key question is whether it will pay off for them, as that's by no means a certainty. And DeepSeek's AI model may make it even easier for other companies to catch up and for competition to intensify.There are many tech companies working on next-gen AI models, and they appear to have similar capabilities (e.g., helping answer common queries, draft messages, create images, etc.). Whether you use ChatGPT, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)'s Copilot, Alphabet's Gemini, or another chatbot, your experience may not be drastically different from one chatbot to the next. And with the DeepSeek AI model being open source, it's easy for other tech companies to build off of it and make their own models, effectively giving them a great head start instead of having to start on their own.Even if users prefer certain chatbots, this preference might not create a strong enough competitive advantage for the tech company behind it. And if that's not the case, then it begs the all important question of whether the spending is justifiable, especially if late comers may not be all that far behind.AI stocks have been hot buys over the past couple of years, but these are investments which can be risky as well. While investors may tolerate high spending for now, they will also expect there to be a payoff in the future. And if those AI-related investments don't result in strong sales growth down the road, that could make the stocks vulnerable to a sell-off.Take Microsoft's Copilot for example. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has said that Microsoft has disappointed its customers. He compared Copilot to the \"Clippy\" assistant Microsoft had in the 90s and called it simply the latest iteration of Clippy.Microsoft's sales aren't exactly taking off, and while it does offer Copilot as a subscription, it recently added its chatbot to its Microsoft 365 subscription, which includes its popular office software such as Word, Outlook, and Excel. Upon doing so, it also raised the price. That could be a sign that perhaps demand for Copilot as a stand-alone subscription wasn't significant. Packaging it along with Microsoft 365 may help increase usage of the chatbot.For a company such as Microsoft, which has been investing heavily into AI, the pressure is on to prove it has been a worthwhile endeavor. The company says its AI business is now generating revenue at an annual run rate of $13 billion, but that's fairly modest for a company which generates more than $260 billion in revenue over the course of a full year. It still has a ways to go to prove that its investments in AI will pay off. This fiscal year (which ends in June), Microsoft is spending $80 billion on AI data centers.There's a lot of hype with AI these days, and it can be difficult to know what's the real deal and what's not. Microsoft and Alphabet can still be good long-term buys and can do well whether or not their AI strategies pay off. After all, they have boatloads of money which can allow them to experiment along the way.In the short run, however, their stocks may experience some volatility depending on how well they are able to execute on their AI strategies and how much revenue they bring in. For other companies without strong businesses to fall back on, the risk may be even greater.While it may be tempting to buy a stock for its AI potential, investors should also consider the risk and uncertainty involved with doing so, as this could be another tough year for tech if reality doesn't match up with expectations.Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN), two of the world's leading drugmakers, missed last year's strong market rally. Both finished 2024 slightly in the red. They're already doing better in 2025, though. And there are good reasons to think both could maintain a strong performance throughout the year. Here's why.Vertex Pharmaceuticals performed well for much of 2024. The stock slid during the year's final months, culminating in a massive one-day drop prompted by a clinical setback.In a phase 2 study, the company's medication suzetrigine barely performed better than a placebo in treating painful lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR), a condition that causes pain in patients' lower backs, hips, and legs. While Vertex will advance the medicine to phase 3 studies in this indication, the market isn't convinced it will be successful.However, Vertex remains an attractive stock. Since that setback, the biotech has earned approval for Alyftrek, a next-generation medicine in its core area of expertise, cystic fibrosis (CF).Furthermore, suzetrigine earned its first indication in treating moderate to severe acute pain -- where it is marketed as Journavx -- becoming the first of a new class of oral non-opioid pain inhibitors on the market.These regulatory wins (especially the second) are lifting Vertex's stock, a rally that could continue for much of the year. Alyftrek should start making some noise, as will Journavx. Vertex's Casgevy, a gene-editing treatment for two rare blood-related diseases that has been on the market for a little over a year, could also contribute to the company's financial results.Vertex should see more pipeline progress, too. The company has a duo of novel medicines in phase 3 studies and several more in earlier stages of development. So, after a subpar 2024, Vertex Pharmaceuticals could perform much better in 2025.What's more important, though, are the company's long-term prospects. And on that front, investors have little to worry about today. Vertex's strategy of developing medicines in areas with large unmet needs has proven to work. The company's dominance in CF in the past decade -- which led to excellent financial results and stock-market performances -- proves as much:Vertex's approvals in areas beyond CF and its exciting pipeline make it a great biotech stock to buy.AstraZeneca's financial results were strong for most of 2024, as was its stock performance. However, the company faced legal issues in the last few months of the year. Some of its executives in China, including its former president in the country, Leon Wang, have been the subject of investigation by the authorities there. That's on top of an insurance fraud investigation and allegations of smuggling of unapproved drugs, also in China.These issues have weighed on AstraZeneca's stock, and certainly add some degree of uncertainty to the company's prospects. However, AstraZeneca's legal problems stem from its operations in China, which strongly suggests wrongdoing by specific people affiliated with the company there. These issues will somewhat affect AstraZeneca's performance in the country, and the company will have to pay back unpaid importation taxes related to the smuggling of unapproved drugs in China.But as AstraZeneca starts moving beyond this issue, its stock price will bounce back. The drugmaker once again proved the strength of its underlying operations in the fourth quarter. The company's revenue of $14.9 billion grew by 24% year over year, a very strong performance by a pharmaceutical giant. AstraZeneca's earnings per share (EPS) soared by 44% year over year to $2.09. Its shares jumped following its earnings release.Even with the China-related issues, AstraZeneca expects its revenue in 2025 to grow by a healthy high-single-digit percentage and its EPS by low double digits. Elsewhere, it expects well over a dozen clinical trial readouts this year, including for AZD6234, a potential anti-obesity medicine. Between AstraZeneca's current lineup, which is still producing excellent results, and its deep pipeline that will lead to plenty of approvals and label expansions, the drugmaker has strong long-term prospects.If not for its issues in China, AstraZeneca's shares would almost certainly be in the green over the trailing-12-month period, so that headwind is already factored into its stock price. If it can deal with that problem, AstraZeneca could perform much better this year. And the stock could also deliver outsized returns to long-term investors.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After more than a century of churning out fuel on the banks of the Houston Ship Channel, the citys oldest refinery is preparing to shut down, potentially putting hundreds of people out of work. Its competitors are welcoming its demise.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayThe closure of the plant  built by industrialist Harry Sinclair in 1918 and now owned by petrochemicals giant LyondellBasell Industries NV  reflects the struggles of a sector thats declining along with demand for its central product.Gasoline consumption in the US peaked five years ago, according to federal data, and the transition to cleaner energy is eroding demand for other fuels, too. Thats turned the refining industry into a Darwinian battleground in which only the fittest survive.Lyondell has faced stiff competition. When the Sinclair refinery began operating a century ago, the plant was little more than a cluster of pipestills on a swampy watershed, and the Houston Ship Channel had just opened as a deepsea port.Now, the refinery is part of a massive petrochemical corridor and is one of 10 fuelmakers in Houston, many of which are modernized megaplants that have been retooled to process light oil from the Permian Basin. To stay viable, Lyondell would have had to sink significant capital  as much as $2 billion, according to RBN Energy Refined Fuels Analytics division  into improving the aging plant. After trying and failing to sell the refinery, the company in 2022 announced it would cease operations.Its not alone. Phillips 66 plans this year to close its Wilmington, California, refinery after shutting a hurricane-damaged Louisiana plant in 2021, and several other refineries are vulnerable. Thats on top of nearly 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity that shuttered after pandemic lockdowns decimated gasoline demand.But the string of closures belie the reality of todays market: Refining profits actually arent that bad. By one measure, theyre about 20% higher than the 10-year average. And in the aftermath of the pandemic, when oil prices tanked but fuel demand was resurging, those profits soared to record-high levels.That post-pandemic jump in refining margins even prompted Lyondell to keep the Houston refinery running for more than two years following its closure announcement. Thats about as long as they could safety operate without investing in costly maintenance and upgrades.Put simply, refineries dont shut down because their margins are bad. They do so because the cant justify the cost of upkeep.If I was looking at a several hundred million-dollar capital expense that I would want to pay off over five or 10 or 20 years, that is where I might start considering the pressure that declining demand will put on margins, said Austin Lin, principal analyst refining and products North America at Wood Mackenzie.Still, now that margins have settled back to pre-pandemic levels, fuelmakers facing a tepid demand outlook are anxious to keep them from falling further.Ultimately, Lyondells closure is a good thing for the market, said Randy Hurburun, senior refinery analyst at London consultancy Energy Aspects.Had the shutdown occurred a few years ago, it might have roiled markets, spiked prices and pushed competitors to quickly ramp up production to make up the shortfall.Instead, the markets treating the closure as a pebble in a fairly big lake, not a boulder in a small lake, said John Auers, managing director of RBN Energys Refined Fuels Analytics division.The plants workforce reflects the industrys shifting dynamics. Its staff has dwindled to around 450 from 1,200 a few years ago and most of those workers were hired after the closure announcement triggered a wave of departures. Only 125 of the plants current staff predate the shutdown decision and just 80 will stay on once operations cease, said Marcos Velez, assistant director of United Steel Workers District 13,(Lyondell has said it will try to place many workers in jobs at its chemical plants.)Market ImpactsThe biggest impact to energy markets may be to fuel exports. Because the refinery is shutting at a time when many plants halt production for seasonal maintenance, supplies of gasoline and diesel will be tighter than usual. To keep the domestic market in balance when demand picks up in the spring, exports will have drop as much as 11%, said Paul Y. Cheng, an analyst with Scotiabank.LyondellBasell on average produces 140,000 barrels a day of gasoline and 100,000 barrels of diesel, while the US exports about 1.9 million barrels a day of the fuels combined.The refinerys competitors will probably benefit from the closure right away. Gulf Coast and Midwestern plants that import heavy oil will see the price of that crude decline as demand for it wanes, according to Auers. The slack in the market could also mitigate price spikes from potential US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican oil.Looming ShutdownsMore closures are probably on the horizon. Smaller, older refineries without access to a variety of crudes or export markets for their products are increasingly vulnerable compared to mega plants like Motiva Enterprises Port Arthur, Exxon Mobil Corps Beaumont and Marathon Petroleum Corps Galveston Bay refineries  three plants that together comprise 10% of US fuel production.New regulations on refineries in California could spur retirements there, too. The largest US refiner by capacity, Valero Energy Corp, last year warned that all options are on the table for its California plants and  echoing the slow demise of LyondellBasells Houston refinery  said it had stopped investing in those West Coast assets beyond whats necessary to keep them running.Refineries reach a natural decision point when the cost of continuing to run outweighs expected future profits, said TD Cowen analyst Jason Gabelman.Refineries unwilling or unable to absorb the cost to modernize, simply find themselves unable to stay competitive, said Auers. The rest get to enjoy fairly attractive and sustainable refining margins.--With assistance from Lucia Kassai.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "Tech stocks soared in 2024. The tech sector may have taken a pause in recent weeks, but the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) market index is still hovering just below the record highs it reached in December.But the soaring stock prices have not reached every corner of the tech market. A couple of legendary industry leaders are trading at significant discounts to their 52-week peaks. Read on to see why you should take a deeper look at semiconductor veterans Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) right now.Micron benefits greatly from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In particular, systems used for training or operation of generative AI tools require a lot of memory.That's true even for DeepSeek, the large language model (LLM) known for its low hardware expenses. The AI accelerator cards running the latest DeepSeek v3 version need more than 1.5 terabytes (TB) of high-speed video memory (VRAM). Lighter models can be managed from a beefy laptop, but even the lower-quality DeepSeek v2 236B must have more than half a TB of video memory. That's kind of hard to fit in a single system, especially a laptop. The largest laptop RAM modules on sale today top out at 48 gigabytes (GB), while servers can get their digital hands on 256-GB cards.And that's a resource-thrifty generative AI system. More ambitious models like OpenAI's ChatGPT use orders of magnitude more processing power -- and memory. And these big-iron solutions are not going away. Remember, the lighter DeepSeek system is possible only because it can tap into the work already done by beefier solutions.So Micron's stock fell along with AI accelerator designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) when DeepSeek hit the world stage in January. In fact, Micron's shares took a deeper haircut than Nvidia's. And the stock was arguably undervalued before the DeepSeek discount.Today, the stock is changing hands at just 9 times forward earnings estimates, according to Finviz. These estimates are about 50% more optimistic than the current run-rate for earnings, against which Micro is trading at a 13x multiple. Given that management expects \"a substantial revenue record\" and much better profitability in the just-started fiscal 2025, that seems like a reasonable assumption.Sales rose 84% year over year in the latest earnings report while the bottom line swung from a robust loss to a solid net profit. Micron is on track to deliver strong growth in 2025, and the stock price doesn't reflect this bullish reality yet.Intel is a different story. The semiconductor veteran is going through a lot of changes, losing market share to longtime rivals Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and running an expensive strategy shift under an interim management team. It's a lot, even for a world-class innovator with deep pockets.But Intel's situation is less dire than its stock chart suggests. Intel shares are trading just a hair above book value, a valuation usually reserved for companies on the brink of bankruptcy. But Intel is nothing of the sort. It's still a market-leading maker of server and PC system processors, not to mention its respectable Gaudi line of AI accelerators. And within the next four to five years, its strategy shift should result in a world-class chip-making foundry business located mostly on American soil.That's a promising position. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the global leader in that industry today. Its stock is valued at nearly 8 times its enormous book value. I'm not saying that Intel will match that valuation ratio in a few years, but it certainly deserves a higher figure than the bargain-bin ratio it's getting today.Yes, many things will need to go right as Intel explores a very different strategy.

        "content": "It's only mid-February, but as of this writing biotech company Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ: AXSM) is up by 55% year to date. Substantial stock-market gains over short periods aren't that rare in the industry. For those who missed Axsome's rally this year, the question is whether the company can perform well over the long run. If that's the case, its shares might still be worth investing in even after their rise.Let's find out whether there's more upside ahead for Axsome Therapeutics.Let's start with a development that recently sent Axsome's stock soaring by about 25% in one day. The company settled a patent lawsuit related to Auvelity, a medicine for major depressive disorder (MDD), with generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Auvelity was first approved in 2022; it's one of only three medicines Axsome has on the market. If Teva had launched a generic version of Auvelity, that would have been a significant headwind for Axsome and completely altered its prospects.Fortunately, Teva's settlement with Axsome now means the former won't be able to launch a generic version of Auvelity until 2038 at the earliest. Axsome will grant Teva a license to launch an Auvelity generic at that point, but it's still 13 or more years away. That's excellent news for Axsome Therapeutics and its shareholders.Besides Auvelity, Axsome's lineup features a treatment for narcolepsy, Sunosi, and the newly approved therapy for migraine, Symbravo. Sunosi and Auvelity are driving strong revenue growth. While Axsome has yet to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, it gave investors a sneak peek. It expects product revenue of $385.2 million for 2024, compared to total revenue of $270.6 million reported last year.So Axsome's 2024 top line should grow by at least 42% compared to 2023. The addition of Symbravo will make an impact on financial results this year. Moreover, the company should make clinical and regulatory progress.It plans to submit Auvelity to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) agitation in the second half of the year. In December, Axsome released data from two phase 3 clinical trials from its lead medicine in this indication; Auvelity hit its primary endpoint in the first study but missed it in the second.However, considering there's a high unmet need in AD -- and very few treatments for the disease have been approved in the past two decades -- there's still an excellent chance the FDA will give the go-ahead.Also in December, Axsome reported that an investigational medicine called AXS-12 aced a phase 3 study in treating narcolepsy. The FDA granted AXS-12 its orphan drug designation, which helps expedite the development of promising medications for orphan diseases (life-threatening conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S.). So the company will move forward with AXS-12, too.Elsewhere, Axsome expects late-stage clinical trial results for Sunosi in MDD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the first quarter of 2025. It's also working on the submission of a regulatory application for AXS-14 in fibromyalgia.Axsome could launch at least one product and earn a key indication for another (Auvelity) in the next 18 months. In the next three years, it could have two other brand-new medicines in its portfolio on top of that. These drugs will drive solid top-line growth well into the 2030s.In my view, Axsome Therapeutics has yet to peak. The biotech company could deliver solid returns in the next five years and beyond, so it's not too late to invest in the stock.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 11 years ago this month. At the time, he took over a software giant whose Windows operating system had been eclipsed by the rise of the smartphone.However, it was Nadella's reduced emphasis on the once-critical Windows operating system that revived Microsoft stock. Thanks to his leadership, Microsoft again plays a relevant role in the tech industry, and this has benefited shareholders of the SaaS stock tremendously.If you had invested $1,000 in Microsoft when Nadella became CEO on Feb. 4, 2014, those shares would now be worth just over $11,100. If you include dividends, that value rises to around $13,500.Nadella's rise to the CEO position occurred as the company's stock fell during the 14-year tenure of Steve Ballmer. At that time, Microsoft suffered after the rise of the smartphone reduced the need for PCs, making the dominance of its Windows operating system less relevant.Nadella had previously served as executive vice president of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise Group. When he became CEO, Nadella capitalized on his successes with this business segment, emphasizing cloud computing and reducing the emphasis on operating systems by discontinuing the Windows Mobile OS. Those moves proved successful as its Azure cloud platform became the leading competitor to Amazon Web Services in the cloud computing industry.Nadella has also made some notable acquisitions, including the business social media platform LinkedIn and gaming giant Activision Blizzard. Additionally, it acquired GitHub, which was recently responsible for the development of Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) platform, Copilot.Amid such developments, Microsoft succeeded to the point that it briefly regained its title as the world's largest publicly traded company measured by market cap. Even if it isn't necessarily holding its title as the world's largest company, its stock gains are unlikely to end anytime soon as it solidifies its leadership across multiple software segments.Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) has surged over the past six months  and its rapid rise has impacted a slew of corporate earnings so far this season.Companies ranging from Big Tech behemoths to consumer-facing brands have mentioned foreign exchange headwinds in both their fourth quarter results and forward-looking guidance, a trend that analysts previously warned could occur.\"Alongside recent US dollar strength, the share of S&P 500 companies mentioning FX has risen across 4Q earnings calls,\" Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin wrote in a note to clients last week.Historically, a strong dollar adversely impacts companies that do most of their business overseas, as it leads to slower revenue and earnings growth over time due to unfavorable foreign exchange conversions.To that point, megacap tech generates a significant amount of revenue overseas. Apple (AAPL) reported roughly 58% of overall revenue from international sales in its most recent quarter. And the percentage of overseas sales from other Magnificent Seven players like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Meta (META) came in at roughly 50% or higher for all of 2024.Virtually all of those companies issued warnings of the dollar's strength in their respective earnings releases and calls. Even Amazon (AMZN), which generated just over 23% of revenue overseas in its latest quarter, reported an approximate $900 million headwind from foreign exchange in Q4, \"about $700 million higher than what we had anticipated.\"As a result, the e-commerce giant said first quarter revenue should only grow between 5% and 9%, which could potentially be the slowest revenue growth quarter in its history.\"This guidance anticipates an unusually large, unfavorable impact of approximately $2.1 billion, or 150 basis points, from foreign exchange rates,\" the company said in the earnings release.But it's not just tech companies feeling the impact.McDonald's (MCD) said it expects \"foreign currency to be a full year headwind to 2025 EPS.\" Coca-Cola (KO) issued similar guidance, forecasting comparable EPS percentage growth \"to include a 6% to 7% currency headwind,\" while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) predicted a $1.7 billion hit to full-year sales.The greenback's positive price action has largely been driven by two main catalysts: Trump's election and the subsequent Republican sweep, along with the recalibration of future Fed easing in the face of strong economic data.After hitting a September low, the US Dollar Index, which measures the dollar's value relative to a basket of six foreign currencies (the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc), has rallied over 7% and is hovering near the two-year highs it reached in January. Since the election, the index has climbed by around 4%.Trump's proposed policies, which include high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration, have led to more bullishness around the dollar, largely due to their protectionist nature.And with most economists in agreement that the bulk of those policies, especially Trump's tariff plans, will lead to higher inflation over time and force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, the cycle surrounding bullish dollar sentiment remains intact.On Monday, President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. Later in the week, he ordered that federal agencies study reciprocal tariffs on trading partners.Read more: What are tariffs, and how do they affect you?Tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.\"The combination of strong US economic growth, solid US asset returns, and the threat of tariffs have supported dollar strength in the later part of 2024 and the beginning of this year,\" Goldman said. The firm predicts the dollar will appreciate by another 3% over the next twelve months.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "I've said many times before that if I could only own one stock, it would be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). In short, investing in Berkshire is like buying a diversified investment portfolio selected by some of the best minds in the industry.Recently, Berkshire became the first stock outside the technology sector to reach a $1 trillion valuation, and many investors think it might be too expensive to buy right now. But I'm not so sure.As of this writing, Berkshire has a $1.014 trillion market cap, and its stock portfolio has a value of about $301 billion. If we subtract that, and the $325 billion in cash Berkshire reported on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, we see the market is valuing Berkshire's businesses at about $388 billion. This is about 12.5 times trailing-12-month operating earnings, a lower valuation than most stocks on my radar.While the valuation is certainly a good reason why it isn't too late to buy Berkshire, the most compelling reason I'd still buy the stock right now is that $325 billion cash stockpile. And keep in mind that this was as of the end of September 2024. It has most likely increased even further by now.This situation gives Berkshire tremendous financial flexibility. For the time being, Berkshire's cash is invested in short-term Treasuries and while interest rates vary over time, the cash is earning somewhere in the neighborhood of $12 billion annually for the company in interest income. But it could also be used if a recession or market crash hits to take advantage of opportunities, or to make a major acquisition if something attractive came along.With so much economic uncertainty in the United States right now, Berkshire's financial flexibility could become a tremendous asset if the stock market becomes volatile.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) stock has continued to decline in 2025 after a nearly 30% drop in 2024. But one Wall Street analyst thinks that shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker have fallen too far.Benchmark EV sector analyst Mickey Legg initiated coverage of Lucid with a \"buy\" rating and a $5 price target, according to reports. That price target implies that the stock has the potential to gain about 80% from recent levels even after a positive response to Legg's report.Lucid has focused on the luxury EV market thus far. It has now added its luxury Gravity SUV to an EV lineup that previously included several trims of the Air sedan. Success in that niche market has been hampered by a slowdown in EV sales growth. But Legg thinks that 2024 will represent a trough, and EV demand will accelerate in 2025 and beyond. Legg summarized his view in a report, writing:We view Lucid as well positioned to achieve significant share of this burgeoning opportunity based on its advanced technology, well-stocked balance sheet and access to capital, award-winning vehicles, Saudi investment, partnerships, and highly integrated manufacturing capabilities.Saudi Arabian support has been crucial for Lucid. The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) is Lucid's largest shareholder and has funneled multiple rounds of capital into the company. It also has an existing 100,000-vehicle order for Lucid's electric sedans.Lucid only delivered about 10,000 EVs in 2024. It's counting on the new Gravity SUV to gain traction with consumers. The company is scheduled to report its full fourth-quarter update on Feb. 25. If investors hear that early interest in the Gravity will help delivery volumes increase meaningfully in 2025, Legg's price target might be achievable.But investors might be best served by waiting to hear what Lucid management says before jumping into the stock.Before you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lucid Group wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Warren Buffett isn't called \"the Oracle of Omaha\" for nothing. The billionaire has proven his knowledge of the stock market over time, and as a result, Berkshire Hathaway has delivered market-beating performance over 58 years. As chairman, Buffett has helped the holding company generate a compounded annual gain of more than 19% over that time period -- that's compared with about a 10% such increase for the S&P 500.So, it's clear Buffett generally has made the right decisions at the right times. This often involves going against the current market trends. In the past, this top investor wrote he and his team \"attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.\"And it's possible this is what is happening right now. As the S&P 500 climbs, after already completing two years of double-digit gains, and investors pile into high-growth stocks such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing players, Buffett just made a shocking move -- and one that could be seen as a warning to investors. Does this famous investor know something Wall Street doesn't? Let's find out.Friday was a big day for investors and the stock market in general as it offered them a glimpse into the latest moves of investing experts. Managers of more than $100 million in stocks must file form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission, detailing their latest buys and sells, on a quarterly basis. And that form was due this past Friday, Feb. 14.It would be impossible to follow every move of every billionaire investor, but taking a look at these experts' latest moves could inspire us to make certain decisions that suit our investment strategies -- or offer us a clue about what may happen next in the market. And considering Warren Buffett's excellent long-term track record, it's a fantastic idea to turn to him first.Before we talk about Buffett's surprising move in the fourth quarter of 2024, though, it's important to quickly discuss his general views on investing. The billionaire is known for value investing, meaning he aims to scoop up shares of companies that are trading for bargain valuations now -- but have what it takes to advance over time. Buffett also has a strong belief that solid American companies will win over the long run, and to gain exposure to these players, he's recommended that non-professional investors add a good S&P 500 Index fund to their holdings.Buffett himself has held two -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) -- since the fourth quarter of 2019. But in a shocking move, Buffett in the recent quarter closed out both of these positions.These funds, mimicking the composition of the S&P 500, offer investors exposure to the benchmark, so they will win or lose according to how the S&P 500 performs. The past two years, as mentioned, have been winning ones. Over time, the S&P hasn't delivered as much of a gain as Buffett's portfolio of carefully chosen stocks, but the index still has been a successful investment.Today the S&P 500 continues to climb in this bull market, yet Buffett has sold these assets that offer exposure to the index's performance. Does this mean Buffett knows something Wall Street doesn't -- and thinks the index may be heading for a correction?We don't know exactly why Buffett made the move, but some may consider this as a warning about the possibility of declines to come. In his most recent shareholder letter, Buffett commented on the \"casino-like behavior\" in the market. And, knowing Buffett's affinity for value, he's surely noticed the S&P 500 is trading at one of its most expensive levels since it launched as a 500-company index back in the late 1950s. The Shiller CAPE ratio, an inflation adjusted measure of a company's earnings-per-share and stock price, has reached beyond 35 -- something it's done only twice before.So, Buffett may have decided to lock in profits ahead of any potential correction and allocate the funds to individual stocks -- he bought one new stock, Constellation Brands, and added to five positions in the quarter.Still, Buffett's past comments highlight his belief in the S&P 500's value as a long-term investment and the strengths of American companies. In his 2013 letter to shareholders, he said that in his will he's advised a trustee to put 90% of his cash in an S&P 500 Index fund to benefit his wife.He also wrote: \"American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so.\"Now the next question is: What does this mean for you as an investor? Of course, it's impossible for any investor -- even Buffett -- to predict with 100% accuracy what the index will do next. So his decision -- or his team's decision -- to sell the S&P 500 index funds doesn't mean you should stay away from these funds or stocks in general. Instead, it highlights the importance of considering valuations and holding onto quality investments for the long haul. After all, even if the S&P 500 falls in the near future, it's likely to deliver a long-term win for you as it's done for many other investors, including Buffett, throughout its history.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has been one of the big winners in the AI boom so far.Shares of the voice-activated AI specialist jumped by more than 800% last year, though it has cooled off a bit since. Investors have bet on the fast-growing company, which got its start as a music identification app like Shazam and now provides technology for automakers, restaurants, and other businesses to run voice-activated systems.SoundHound has been growing fast as well, with revenue up 89% in the third quarter to $25.1 million, though acquisitions have helped drive that growth.The stock trades at a sky-high valuation with a price-to-sales ratio of 63. That and a lack of profitability could set it up for a pullback this year since most of last year's gains seem to be due to hype on its association with AI.The following two stocks look like good bets to be more valuable than SoundHound AI one year from now.GXO Logistics (NYSE: GXO) is the world's biggest pure-play contract logistics company. It operates nearly 1,000 high-tech warehouses, serving companies like Apple and Nike to make sure products get to where they are going quickly and efficiently, and process returns as needed.Since being spun off from XPO in 2021, GXO Logistics has delivered generally strong results, but the stock pulled back sharply recently after management said that a potential acquisition of the company was no longer happening.The stock is now down by roughly a third from where it was trading before that news broke in December, and its market cap is now slightly below SoundHound's at $5.1 billion as of Feb. 11.However, GXO doesn't need a buyout in order to be successful. In fact, the company was spun off with the mandate that it would grow through acquisitions, consolidating its leadership in the industry. It bought Clipper Logistics and Wincanton in the United Kingdom and PFSweb in the U.S.In addition to the disappointment with the lack of a buyout, the stock may be languishing due to weakness in the broader industrial economy and concern about tariffs. Nonetheless, the company is still on track for hitting its 2027 targets, which call for $8 billion to $12 billion in revenue and $1.6 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The stock is trading at just three times that figure today.If GXO can keep making progress toward that goal, the stock looks like a good bet to double or even triple by 2027, passing SoundHound along the way.Another fast-growing company with the potential to overtake SoundHound in market cap this year is Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG).The fast-casual salad chain has been growing quickly but has a market cap of just $3 billion. Nonetheless, it has many of the components of a winning restaurant stock.Its average unit volume is $2.9 million, in line with industry leaders like Chipotle, and it's growing steadily with comparable-store sales up 6% in the third quarter, driving revenue up 13%.Sweetgreen also has a secret weapon that may appeal to investors looking for exposure to AI. The company has been rolling out a kitchen robot called Infinite Kitchen. According to management, the technology helps improve throughput and saves on labor, improving financial results and customer satisfaction at its stores that have deployed them.It is priced as a growth stock, but it has a lot of growth potential since it has less than 250 restaurants currently, it's the clear leader in the emerging fast-casual salad sector, and Infinite Kitchen gives it a competitive advantage.Sweetgreen stock has pulled back recently, which sets up a buying opportunity, especially if it can keep up its recent momentum with solid top-line growth and margin expansion.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "The S&P 500 is in the midst of a market rally that has persisted for more than two years and continues to defy detractors. A solid economic outlook, growing corporate profits, and the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) have all helped fuel the market's advances. After gaining 24% in 2023, the benchmark index tacked on gains of 23% in 2024. Market history suggests the S&P will likely continue to climb higher in 2025.Over the past 50 years, the S&P 500 has generated positive returns 78% of the time. Additionally, following years with successive gains of more than 20%, the S&P has risen 12%, an average, which suggests there's still upside ahead.There's also been a resurgence in the popularity of stock splits, causing investors to reexamine companies that have split their shares since this corporate action has historically been preceded by strong operating and financial results, helping drive the stock price higher.Let's review two companies with impressive track records that are worth a look.The first long-term winner investors should be watching is Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET). The stock has gained 66% over the past year and is up 2,880% over the past decade (as of this writing). This performance encouraged management to conduct a 4-for-1 stock split, which was completed in December. Despite the company's long track record, the advent of generative AI a couple of years ago represents a compelling opportunity that has only just begun.Arista Networks claim to fame was the development of groundbreaking network switches that connect high-speed servers and other devices on a network with near instantaneous response times. The company now boasts a whole suite of offerings that includes switches, routers, and other networking equipment used to speed data between servers, data centers, and across networks. Arista recently developed custom Ethernet systems designed to meet the rigorous demands of the large language models (LLMs) that form the foundation of AI.In the third quarter, Arista generated revenue of $1.8 billion, up 20% year over year and 7% sequentially. This generated earnings per share (EPS) of $2.33, an increase of 35%. The results easily surpassed Wall Street's expectations and management's previously issued guidance. Shareholders are looking forward to a similar performance when Arista releases its fourth-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday, Feb. 18.As the bull market continues to run, investors are becoming more aware of rising valuations. Arista Networks is currently selling for 56 times earnings, which would make the stock unattractive to some investors. However, its forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- a metric that's more appropriate for high-growth stocks -- comes in at 0.95, when any number less than 1 is the standard for an undervalued stock.The company's Ethernet and data center expertise is making it a key player in the AI revolution. Add to that Arista Networks' long history of successful execution and its reasonable valution, and its clear why the stock is a buy.Another company investors should have on their shortlist is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW). The stock is essentially flat over the past year but is up 813% over the past decade (as of this writing). This company's long history of performance prompted management to declare a 2-for-1 forward stock split that was completed late last year. The cybersecurity company made a strategic business decision last year that sent fair-weather investors running for the exits -- and therein lies the opportunity.Most companies have a cybersecurity system that is cobbled together from a variety of vendors, leaving gaps that hackers can exploit. The resulting data breaches and unauthorized intrusions can cost these businesses millions of dollars and the loss of customer confidence. Palo Alto addressed this issue by consolidating its individual modules into a unified protection platform integrated with AI. To sweeten the deal further, Palo Alto offered free services to brdige the gap for customers (and potential customers) that had obligations with multiple vendors and varying contract expiration dates.This strategy was a risky one, but management reports it has shown early success. Customers have been \"signing larger transactions\" in response to these changes, which \"deliver better security outcomes,\" according to CEO Nikesh Arora. Customers have a \"significant incentive\" to avail themselves of the company's full suite of offerings: security operations, cloud security, and network security.During its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Oct. 31), Palo Alto returned to growth sooner than expected, generating revenue that grew 14% year over year to $2.1 billion, resulting in EPS that surged 77% to $0.99. Even more telling, annual recurring revenue from the company's next-generation security services increased 40% to $4.5 billion. This is evidence that management's change in strategy is experiencing success.Investors relying on the most commonly used valuation metrics might be put off, as the stock is selling for 51 times earnings (as of this writing). However, its PEG ratio of 0.15 is a clear indication that Palo Alto Networks is cheaper than it looks.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Midstream energy stocks have been anything but middling performers recently. Just look at Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) and Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET). These two leading midstream stocks have soared 33% and 42%, respectively, over the last 12 months.Just because one has been a bigger winner in the past doesn't necessarily mean it will remain on top, though. Is Enbridge a better ultra-high-yield dividend stock to buy right now than Energy Transfer? Here's how the two stocks compare.Enbridge's and Energy Transfer's business models are similar in several ways. They both have extensive pipeline networks in North America.Probably the main differentiator with their midstream operations is that Enbridge's pipelines are in Canada and the U.S., while Energy Transfer's pipelines are only in the U.S. That's understandable since Enbridge is a Canadian company, whereas Energy Transfer is based in the U.S.Another key difference between the two companies is that Enbridge is more diversified. Thanks to acquisitions completed in 2023, it now ranks as the largest North American natural gas utility company.Perhaps the most important overall way these businesses differ is in size. Enbridge's market cap is around $99 billion. The company generated adjusted earnings of over 6 billion in Canadian dollars and distributable cash flow of almost CA$12 billion last year.Energy Transfer's market cap of nearly $68 billion is significantly lower. So are the midstream operator's 2024 earnings of $1.08 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.98 billion.Enbridge projects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) between CA$19.4 billion and CA$20 billion in 2025. This reflects year-over-year growth of nearly 17% at the midpoint of the range.Energy Transfer expects adjusted EBITDA between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion this year. The midpoint of this guidance range reflects a year-over-year increase of around 5%.Could potential tariffs on Canadian imports to the U.S. impact Enbridge's business? Perhaps, but I don't think the effects will be significant. Over the longer term, the growth prospects for these two companies should be similar because they face many of the same industry dynamics and opportunities.Both Enbridge and Energy Transfer offer especially juicy dividends/distributions. However, Enbridge's forward dividend yield of 6.05% is lower than Energy Transfer's forward distribution yield of 6.58%.The tables are turned when we look at dividend/distribution track records, though. Enbridge has increased its dividend for an impressive 30 consecutive years. Energy Transfer slashed its distribution in 2020 as the company reeled from the impact of the pandemic but began growing its distribution again in 2022.Energy Transfer's valuation looks more attractive than Enbridge's no matter what metric we use. While Enbridge's shares trade at 21.5 times forward earnings, Energy Transfer's forward earnings multiple is only 10.7. There's an even greater gap between the two stocks based on price-to-sales ratios, with Energy Transfer trading at 0.82 times sales versus 2.87 for Enbridge.The enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiples for the two stocks are much closer, but Energy Transfer still comes out ahead with an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.82 compared to 2.87 for Enbridge.I think both Enbridge and Energy Transfer are great picks for income investors. If I could pick only one, though, the nod would go to Energy Transfer. It offers a higher yield and a more appealing valuation.However, investors who prefer a more stable business will probably find Enbridge better suited for their portfolios. Also, anyone seeking to avoid the tax hassles associated with investing in limited partnerships will likely want to go with Enbridge rather than Energy Transfer.Before you buy stock in Energy Transfer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Energy Transfer wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Investing in Bitcoin is a bit risky, considering that real-world uses for the digital token are still limited, and its price can be very volatile. But Bitcoin continues to gain more widespread acceptance among investors, and financial institutions are warming to the cryptocurrency with their launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year.These ETFs have made it easy for investors to dip their toes into the sometimes wild world of cryptocurrencies. If you're bullish on Bitcoin's long-term prospects, here are two ETFs that are a great place to put $100.The iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) was one of the first Bitcoin ETFs to launch last year, and it has quickly become one of the most popular among investors. After about a year of existence, the ETF has about $56 billion in assets.The size of the iShares Bitcoin ETF is notable because it means there's plenty of people buying and selling the ETF shares, allowing for easy liquidity and potentially lower transaction costs. The ETF's backing by BlackRock, a prominent investment company, and Coinbase, a top cryptocurrency exchange for Bitcoin custody, is also noteworthy.The Bitcoin fund has become popular among some billionaires, too, with Millennium Management's Israel Englander adding 12.6 million shares of the ETF late last year, bringing his total up to 23.5 million shares.It's also fairly inexpensive to own the iShares Bitcoin Trust. The ETF charges an expense ratio of just 0.25%, which means you'll pay $2.50 annually for every $1,000 invested. That's not the lowest fee available for a Bitcoin ETF, but it's competitive.Another popular option for Bitcoin investors is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (NYSEMKT: BTC). If you're wondering why it has \"mini\" in its name, it's because the ETF was spun off from one of Grayscale's larger Bitcoin ETFs, with 10% of its holdings going to the new, smaller ETF.One of the most notable things about the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF is that it has one of the lowest fees of Bitcoin ETFs, charging just 0.15%, or $1.50 per $1,000 invested. That's far cheaper than the company's original Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has an annual management fee of 1.5%.Cheaper fees are always important for inventors because it means you'll keep more of your returns as the value of your ETF goes up. For example, if you invested $2,000 into the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF and Bitcoin's value increased 10% over the next year, you'd save about $30 in annual fees, compared to owning the original Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Bitcoin's value has soared about 100% over the past year (as of this writing), which has sparked a lot of interest among new crypto investors. But Bitcoin's value can be very volatile. Most recently, the digital token's value dropped nearly 13% between mid-December and early January.Even if you're investing just $100 into a Bitcoin ETF, make sure you understand that cryptocurrency investments are still speculative. Being able to stomach large price swings up and down is a must, as is keeping a level head when things turn sour.If you're not comfortable with large price swings but still want a simple way to invest your money, an S&P 500 index fund may be a better option.Before you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasnt one of them.

        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) chugged to a record high last week as new inflation data signaled good news about the Federal Reserve's rate cut plans.For the week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 2.5%, while the S&P 500 added just under 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added about 0.5%.Corporate earnings season will roll on, headlined by quarterly reports from Alibaba (BABA) and Walmart (WMT). Overall, 46 S&P 500 companies are expected to announce results during the holiday-shortened trading week.The week ahead will bring a quieter flow of economic news. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting and updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment, will be in focus for investors.Markets will be closed on Monday for Presidents' Day.Last week, two fresh inflation readings for the month of January showed prices increased more than Wall Street had expected, but economists found positive news for markets and the Federal Reserve within the details.When evaluating categories from both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) that feed into the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumptions Expenditures (PCE) index, it appears that price increases likely slowed in the month of January.Economists now expect \"core\" PCE, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, will likely clock in at 2.6% in January, down from the 2.8% seen in December. This leaves markets pricing in one or two interest rate cuts from the Fed in 2025, little changed from the week prior, per Bloomberg data. And importantly, many economists still think the Fed is closer to cutting interest rates rather than hiking them.\"We think the bar for Fed hikes remains high,\" Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"The evolution of inflation expectations and second-round effects from tariffs on services inflation remain key points of emphasis. But, for now, we still think the distribution of Fed policy outcomes skews in the direction of rate cuts as opposed to hikes.\"Investors will be looking to the Fed's minutes from its January meeting, due out for release on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET, for any further clues on how the central bank is thinking about the path forward for interest rates.The S&P 500 is back near a record high, and this time around, it's not all about a handful of tech stocks. Yes, Meta (META) stock has risen for 20 straight days and its more than 25% gain this year has contributed to the S&P 500's increase. But Meta and Amazon (AMZN) are the only Magnificent Seven tech stocks to have outperformed the S&P 500 thus far in 2025. Meanwhile, the number of companies outpacing the index's 4% gain has soared to start 2025.As of Wednesday's close, 48% of the S&P 500 is outperforming the index in 2025, in line with the 25-year median and above the 29% seen last year. As Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, the last two years had marked the lowest number of stocks outperforming the index in 25 years.Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods told Yahoo Finance the number of stocks participating in the current rally shows strength within the bull market but doesn't exactly mean the benchmark index itself will shoot higher.\"If we get a bad report out of Nvidia in a few weeks [on Feb. 26], then we could see the market turn lower,\" Woods said. \"But we'll still see rotation, just not into the names that are really making headlines.\"While many of the Magnificent Seven haven't been the market leaders this year, AI euphoria appears alive and well in markets. AI software company Palantir (PLTR) is the top performer in the S&P 500 in 2025, rising more than 55%, followed by Super Micro Computer (SMCI), which is also up over 50%.Aggressive moves in other AI plays on Friday underscored this theme as investors quickly dumped some stocks and bought positions in others after Nvidia disclosed its latest equity holdings. The AI chip giant ditched positions in Serve Robotics (SERV) and SoundHound (SOUN). Both stocks sold off on the news.Meanwhile, shares of WeRide (WRD), a Chinese autonomous driving play, saw its stock nearly double.Markets are closed for Presidents' Day.TuesdayEconomic data: Empire Manufacturing, February (-1 expected, -12.6 prior); NAHB housing market index, February, (47 expected, 47 prior)Earnings: Devon Energy (DVN), Oxy (OXY), Toll Brothers (TOL)WednesdayEconomic data: MBA Mortgage applications, week ending Feb. 14 (2.3% prior); Housing starts month-over-month, January (-7% expected, +15.8% prior); Building permits month-over-month, January preliminary (-2.3% expected, -0.7% prior); FOMC meeting minutes, January Fed meetingEarnings: Carvana (CVNA), the Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), Etsy (ETSY), Garmin (GRMN), Toast (TOST), Wingstop (WING)Economic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 15, (213,000 prior); Philadelphia Fed business outlook, February (25.4 expected, 44.3 prior); Leading index, January (0% expected, -0.1% prior)Earnings: Alibaba Group (BABA), Walmart (WMT), Block (XYZ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Rivian (RIVN), Shake Shack (SHAK), Unity (U), Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), Dropbox (DBX)Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, February preliminary (51.2 prior); S&P Global US services PMI, February preliminary (52.9 prior); S&P Global US composite PMI, February preliminary (52.7 prior); University of Michigan sentiment, February final (68.7 prior)Earnings: No notable earnings releases.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Rexford Industrial (NYSE: REXR) and W.P. Carey (NYSE: WPC) are slotted into different niches in the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. Both have a focus on industrial assets, so investors looking at one might also want to consider the other. But when it comes to the way they run their respective businesses, these two REITs are polar opposites.Here's why some investors will love Rexford and hate W.P. Carey, and why other investors will hold the opposing view.Rexford is an industrial REIT, which means that it owns things like warehouses that it leases out to tenants. What sets the company apart from the pack, however, is that it is entirely focused in the Southern California region. This is a sharp business model. That said, the Southern California market is one of the largest and most important industrial markets in the world, because it's a gateway from Asia into the United States.There's a supply/demand imbalance in this region that has long put property owners in a strong position. To be fair, coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, Rexford's position was much stronger, highlighted by rent increases on expiring leases that were in excess of 80%. Today it has \"only\" been able to raise rents in the 30% space, which is still pretty phenomenal.As a net lease REIT, W.P. Carey owns single-tenant properties for which its tenants are responsible for most property-level operating costs. It is among the largest companies in this niche, but it generates nearly two-thirds of its rents from industrial assets. This is why it may interest the same investors who would be looking at Rexford.However, there's a big difference. W.P. Carey's portfolio is spread across North America and Europe, so diversification is a big theme for the REIT. What's more, roughly 22% of its rents come from retail properties, and the rest falls into a very broad \"other\" category. This diversification, coupled with the portfolio's geographic reach, helps reduce the concentration risk investors would face with a REIT like Rexford.That said, diversification hasn't always resulted in wins for W.P. Carey. It recently chose to exit the office sector in one quick move. That choice improved the portfolio, given the weak office dynamics today, but it resulted in a dividend reset, which might turn off some dividend investors.Before you walk away from W.P. Carey, however, it's important to note that in the quarter after the dividend reset, the dividend started to increase again. It has increased every quarter since the cut, which was the cadence prior to the reset. In other words, the office exit and dividend reset was a tough call, but one made from a position of strength.The slowdown in Rexford's rental growth rate has left investors sour on the shares, pushing them down by around 50% since their 2022 peak. That has pushed the dividend yield up to a historically high 4.1% or so. This suggests that Rexford, which has grown its dividend at a compound annual rate of roughly 13% a year for a decade, is on sale right now. If you are a dividend growth investor willing to take on a highly focused and currently unloved stock, it would probably be a good choice for you.But Rexford's laser-like focus will probably worry more conservative dividend investors. Those investors will probably prefer W.P. Carey, which has a lofty 6.2% yield. Yes, there is that dividend cut to consider. But prior to the cut, the dividend had been increased annually for over two decades. And after the cut, the REIT immediately started to increase the dividend again, clearly trying to show investors that it remained a reliable dividend stock.If they can see past the cut and view it as a reset, more conservative high-yield lovers will probably prefer W.P. Carey and its diversified portfolio over Rexford.Neither Rexford nor W.P. Carey are well loved on Wall Street today. There are good reasons for this, but it seems likely that investors are overly focused on short-term concerns in both cases. If you think long-term, both of these industrial-focused REITs should be of interest to you. But given their very different portfolio approaches, you'll probably favor one over the other.More aggressive investors should focus on Rexford, while more conservative ones will want to take the time to understand W.P. Carey's long-term prospects.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Nvidia has been the undisputed winner of the artificial intelligence trade, as the leader in creating chips and network infrastructure that power AI solutions. However, there are plenty of competitors trying to get in on the action. After all, the potential market for AI is expected to be so big that just a small connection to the market can send a stock soaring.Two stocks that have been clumped in with the AI trade and that make chips and other AI infrastructure are Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Broadcom has performed well, with its stock up nearly 86% over the last year. Meanwhile, AMD has struggled, with its stock down nearly 36%.Wall Street analysts currently expect one of these companies to grow earnings faster in 2025, but the other to outperform in stock price appreciation over the next 12 to 18 months. Let's take a look.While Nvidia has made its name by dominating the broad chip market, Broadcom has focused on creating custom chips for some of the large tech players like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft.After the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese company that claims to have developed an AI chatbot at a fraction of the cost of competitors', many think custom chips will be the path forward, which bodes well for Broadcom. Others also suspect Broadcom has locked up new customers like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The company has now topped a $1 trillion market capitalizationFor its fiscal year ended in November, Broadcom only reported $1.27 of earnings per share, but most of this was due to the amortization of intangibles related to the company's acquisition of VMWare in late 2023. On an operating basis, diluted earnings came in at $4.86. Wall Street analysts on average expect the company to grow diluted earnings to $4.01 in fiscal 2025 and generate operating diluted earnings of $6.35, according to data provided by Visible Alpha.On the company's last earnings call, management expressed bullishness on the custom chip market and thinks the company will play a role as hyper-scalers roll out their own custom AI accelerators or chips. Broadcom cited its three hyperscaler customers and said that together, their journeys represent an AI serviceable addressable market (SAM) for custom chips and network in the $60 billion to $90 billion range in fiscal 2027.Broadcom's stock has performed well, and analysts think it is fairly valued at this point. While no analysts are saying to sell, 27 have issued research reports on the company over the last three months, according to TipRanks. The average price target implies very minimal upside. Analysts don't seem bearish on the company at all, so it may be more of a valuation call to let the stock catch its breath. Broadcom currently trades at close to 37 times forward earnings.Being in the AI game is a big deal, which is why investors are often discussing Advanced Micro Devices. However, AMD's main problem is that it has to compete against Nvidia, a company generating gross profit margins in the mid-70s percentile and demonstrating extreme pricing power. According to experts, AMD manufactures cheaper chips than Nvidia, but they're only about 80% as powerful.Still, Wall Street analysts currently expect earnings to grow nicely this year -- from $1.00 in 2024 to $2.47 in 2025, according to Visible Alpha. On an operating basis, analysts expect earnings to grow from $3.31 to $4.62. However, we'll see how long these last after AMD's recent earnings disappointed the market. The company beat on estimates and even delivered revenue guidance ahead of consensus.But revenue in the company's data center segment came in lighter than expected, which disappointed investors given how much the market is growing. After earnings, some analysts expressed concern about the outlook for growth in AMD's AI business.Despite weaker data center numbers, analysts are still largely bullish on the stock. A total of 36 analysts have issued research reports on the company over the past three months, according to TipRanks. Of these, 24 analysts rate the stock a buy, 11 say to hold, and only one says to sell. The average price target suggests nearly 33% upside from current levels (as of Feb. 11).The discrepancy between AMD and Broadcom looks to be based on valuation. While Broadcom trades at 37 times forward earnings, AMD trades at around 23 times. In the near term, AMD may have more room to run on any change in sentiment. However, Broadcom seems to be better positioned to take advantage of current trends in the AI market.Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Broadcom wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has quickly emerged as a leading player in the generative AI race through internal investments in its products and services and billions of dollars in investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI.Some recent research from The Motley Fool analyzed Microsoft's earnings call to find some of the ways the company mentions how it will benefit from generative AI and what steps it's taking now to expand its artificial intelligence footprint. Here's how AI factors into the company's long-term growth plans.One important area that's at the top of nearly every major tech company's AI strategy is data center infrastructure spending.Microsoft's management has mentioned infrastructure spending frequently. On the recent second-quarter earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, \"We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history.\"And Microsoft isn't even close to finishing up its data center infrastructure spending. The company recently said it's on track to spend $80 billion this year alone to build AI data centers and train AI models for its Azure cloud platform.Recent AI developments by Chinese start-up DeepSeek have raised the question of how much spending is necessary to build advanced AI, but so far, Microsoft and others are staying the course.By building some of the most advanced data centers, Microsoft hopes to stay ahead of cloud infrastructure companies and offer its Azure cloud computing customers the most robust AI services and tools.Another way Microsoft has talked about its generative AI opportunities is through its relationship and investment with OpenAI. Microsoft was an early investor in the ChatGPT creator and has already invested an estimated $13 billion into the company. One analyst even said it might be \"some of the best money ever spent.\"The investment has given Microsoft access to some of the most advanced large language models (LLMs) through ChatGPT, which it's integrated into many of its services, including Bing, Microsoft 365, and Azure. The foundation of the company's AI Copilot comes from ChatGPT's technology, and it's likely to continue.Nadella said recently that OpenAI had made a new large Azure commitment, adding: \"Through our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth. And with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models.\"The company's partnership that extends through 2030 states that OpenAI's API is exclusive to Azure, Microsoft has rights to OpenAI IP (for use in its Copilot service), and the two companies have revenue sharing agreements \"that flow both ways.\" One thing to note is that OpenAI can use other cloud providers for future AI training, but Microsoft has the right of first refusal.The point here is that Microsoft and OpenAI are still very closely linked, and the two companies benefit from each other's success. Of course, that relationship could change down the line, but for now, it seems the two are still significantly intertwined.Microsoft is a key player in cloud computing, with the company taking 20% of the cloud market, behind Amazon's 31%. The good news for the company and shareholders is that artificial intelligence will likely supercharge cloud revenue, with Goldman Sachs estimating global cloud sales could reach $2 trillion by 2030 because of AI.Microsoft is building its future around this, and so far it's been successful. The company's AI business now has $13 billion in annualized revenue -- a 175% increase year over year.The AI wars are underway, and Microsoft made a strategic and seemingly prescient decision to tie itself to OpenAI early on. That's already helped the company boost its Azure sales and ensure its products have the latest AI models. That's not a guarantee of future success, of course, but it's certainly a great initial move as it plans for future artificial intelligence growth.Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Microsoft wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Investors should never ignore valuations when picking stocks. The price a stock trades at can drastically impact your overall returns. A metric such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio can be helpful in enabling you to easily gauge how expensive or cheap a stock is.In some cases, however, it can make sense to buy a stock that's trading at a seemingly high P/E multiple simply because of its fantastic growth prospects. If you wait for a top growth stock to come down to a P/E of 20 or less, you may end up waiting forever and missing out on the opportunity completely.Below, I'll make the case for why pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) still looks like a great buy right now -- even though it trades at a P/E of more than 70 -- and why selling the healthcare stock could be a mistake.For years, Eli Lilly has been generating solid growth numbers -- but lately, they've been accelerating rapidly. The company is coming off a solid quarter where its revenue rose by 45% for the last three months of 2024:The recent surge has been due to the tremendous growth Lilly has achieved due to its highly popular GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss). Together, those two products generated $5.4 billion in sales for Eli Lilly last quarter, or 40% of the top line.Demand has been so strong that shortages of Lilly's GLP-1 drugs have been an issue. The company has been investing billions of dollars into increasing its production capacity at a manufacturing site in Lebanon, Indiana. And as it begins producing medicines there, potentially as early as next year, that could help boost its sales.Eli Lilly is still in the early stages of its growth when it comes to GLP-1 treatments. The drugs are game changers for patients, helping them lose weight and become healthier in the process. Currently, Lilly's GLP-1 treatments are injectables.However, by next year, the company may have an even more attractive option for patients: a highly effective oral weight loss drug called orforglipron. By April, the company expects to release late-stage trial data for the drug, which has previously shown that on average, it can help people lose around 15% of their body weight. If the new trial results are strong, they could pave the way for approval by sometime next year.Approval for orforglipron would not only generate a lot of bullishness for the healthcare stock, but would also provide Eli Lilly with yet another blockbuster drug, and potentially enable it to reach a broader range of patients.Shares of Eli Lilly haven't been doing well in recent months, but over the long run, I think they will more than recover. This is a company whose valuation could very well top $1 trillion within the next year or two. Its market capitalization sits around $780 billion now, and reaching that pinnacle would require the stock to rise less than 30% from where it is right now.Lilly's P/E ratio may appear high now. But as the company scales up its operations and its profits rise, that multiple will come down, so I wouldn't be overly concerned with it. Given its robust business and terrific portfolio of drugs, you're likely better off simply buying and holding the stock rather than waiting for the P/E to come down, as doing so could result in missing out on some terrific gains along the way.And while current shareholders may secure a good profit by selling it today, unless they need the money for other reasons, there's no compelling reason to sell -- this is a stock which still has a ton of upside in the long run.Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Is it official? Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been chasing Walmart (NYSE: WMT) as the largest company in the world by sales for years. Amazon's sales typically grow at a faster rate than Walmart's, but although the gap has been closing for a while, Walmart has been growing fast enough to maintain its lead.However, that might be about to change. After Amazon's smashing fourth quarter, it might be pulling ahead in the race. Let's see what's happening with these two giants and how that might affect your investing thesis.It has never made sense to bet against Amazon, and although the stakes are high right now, I would say that still holds true.Sales increased 10% year over year in the fourth quarter, and double-digit growth for a company as large as Amazon is truly a feat. I almost wrote a rare feat, but it's really unprecedented, because the only other company as large as Amazon is Walmart, and the last time Walmart reported double-digit quarterly growth was in 2007.Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $187.8 billion. Amazon gives a detailed breakdown of where sales are coming from, and they include:$75.6 billion from online stores$47.5 billion from third-party sellers$28.8 billion from Amazon Web Services (AWS)$17.3 billion from advertising$11.6 billion from subscription services$5.6 billion from physical stores$1.6 billion from \"other\"Although it reported a fantastic quarter, with a 61% increase in total operating income, its first-quarter guidance came in below expectations and disappointed investors. It's guiding for revenue to increase 4% to 8% year over year. Amazon usually meets or exceeds guidance, although it may have foreign exchange headwinds, which is the reason management said it didn't come in at the high end of guidance, or 11%, in the fourth quarter. Without that headwind, Amazon's fourth-quarter sales did increase 11% year over year.Amazon is buckling down on its artificial intelligence (AI) program, which it sees as the future of all app development. CEO Andy Jassy gave a nuanced explanation of why it's so important, and although the company raised eyebrows with its $100 billion expected investment in AI in 2025, it's setting itself up for further growth down the line. Analysts are expecting about $155 billion in first-quarter sales and $699 billion in 2025 sales, which implies a nearly 10% increase over 2024.Walmart reports its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year results next week. Analysts are expecting $179 billion in fourth-quarter sales.If Walmart meets that, or even exceeds it somewhat, it will still be below Amazon's results for a similar time period. Walmart's fourth quarter ends Jan. 31, so it's not totally comparable.For the full year, Walmart should still be ahead, with $677 billion expected in sales for fiscal 2025, versus $638 billion for Amazon in 2024. For fiscal 2026, the average consensus for Walmart is $695 billion, a hair behind the average consensus for Amazon's 2025 results. Here's a visual representation of how the gap is closing.It matters to some degree. Walmart is a steady choice for investors because it leverages its unbeatable retail network to grow and deliver value for shareholders. It pays a growing, reliable dividend, and investors can feel confident about its ability to pay it.And its growth story is far from over. Besides the ability to keep opening stores, which it's always doing, Walmart is finding ways to generate engagement from its loyal customers and harness its platform to meet consumer needs. For example, e-commerce is one of its major growth drivers right now, increasing 27% year over year in the third quarter (ended Oct. 31). It has an edge over Amazon in its omnichannel options, which make uses of its 10,000+ stores globally. That doesn't mean it's going to take over as the top e-commerce player, but it does mean it can hold its own and present opportunities that will keep it as the second-most important player in U.S. e-commerce.As long as it continues to demonstrate steady growth, which has been picking up lately, falling into second place shouldn't make a difference to investors beyond losing that cachet.As for Amazon, it demonstrates that as large as Amazon is, there's a lot more space to grow. As you'll notice above, AWS brings in only about 14% of total revenue. With the largest opportunity it has existing in AI, that could go a lot higher.Now is an excellent time to invest in Amazon, and if you're looking for a solid dividend stock, Walmart can still fit the bill.Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) earlier this month reported fourth-quarter financial results that crushed Wall Street's expectations. The stock has rocketed higher on the news, such that its total return since January 2024 now stands at 585%.Palantir was the best-performing member of the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during that period. In fact, it beat the next closest stock by 250 percentage points. But Palantir is now one of the most expensive software stocks in history, and there is little questions about what happens next: One way or another, it's valuation is going to fall.Here are the important details.Brent Thill at Jefferies in a recent CNBC interview praised Palantir for strong execution in the fourth quarter. But he also noted the stock has a forward price-to-sales (PS) ratio above 55, a valuation that few software companies have ever achieved and no company has ever maintained. To clarify, the forward PS ratio equals the market value divided by the forecasted revenue from the next year.My own research led to the same conclusion. After looking at more than 50 software stocks over the last decade, here's what I found:Only five software companies (excluding Palantir) achieved a forward PS ratio above 40: Asana, Confluent, Snowflake, UiPath, and Unity Software.Only Snowflake achieved a forward PS ratio over 50. The stock peaked just shy of 60 times forward sales in November 2021.After hitting their peak valuations, all five stocks fell more than 50% in the next 12 months. Additionally, they ultimately suffered maximum declines exceeding 70%, and they are still at least 50% below their record highs today.Palantir has a forward PS multiple of 56 as of Feb. 13. Snowflake is the only other software company in the last decade (to my knowledge) to achieve a higher valuation multiple, and its stock crashed after peaking near 60 time forward sales. That is particularly worrisome because Snowflake's revenue was growing faster than 100% when it hit that valuation multiple.Comparatively, Palantir's trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue increased just 29% in 2024, and Wall Street expects revenue to increase just 32% in 2025. Meanwhile, Palantir shares have advanced 585% since January 2024, putting upward pressure on its valuation multiple. As a result, it is now one of the most expensive software stocks in history.That does not mean Palantir is headed for a reckoning anytime soon. However, every available data point suggests its forward PS multiple is headed much lower in the future, and there are only three ways that can happen: Wall Street analysts raise their revenue forecasts significantly, Palantir shares decline sharply, or some combination of the two.The International Data Corporation (IDC) recently ranked Palantir as the market leader in decision intelligence software. And Forrester Research has recognized the company as a technology leader in artificial intelligence platforms, awarding its AIP product higher scores than similar solutions from Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.That puts Palantir in a good position. IDC estimates AI platform spending will grow at 40% annually through 2028. So, the company has very compelling growth prospects. However, not even the best business is worth buying at any price. Palantir's forward PS multiple is an alarm bell that shouldn't be ignored.Instead, current shareholders should consider selling down their positions, particularly if Palantir accounts for a large percentage of their portfolio. Similarly, prospective investors should keep the stock on their watchlists for now. I think much better buying opportunities will arise in the future.For instance, even though Snowflake is currently 52% off its record high, the stock is also 77% above its record low. So, investors have had plenty of opportunities to make money on Snowflake since its sharp decline in early 2022. The same is likely true of Palantir. The key is waiting for the right price, rather than chasing a stock with an alarmingly high valuation.Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Palantir Technologies wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Litecoin and Cardano saw significant price jumps over the last 24 hours, with Litecoin climbing by 11% and trading above $128, while Cardano rose 16%, surpassing $0.81. This contrasts with Bitcoin and Ethereum, which only experienced modest gains of 0.5% and 1%, respectively.The surge in prices is linked to growing optimism around the approval of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have highlighted that the likelihood of approval for ETFs tracking cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin, and XRP has increased. They estimate that Litecoin ETFs, filed by Canary Capital and Grayscale, have a 90% chance of approval. Solana and XRP ETFs are expected to have approval chances of 70% and 65%, while Dogecoin products are seen to have a 75% chance of success.The excitement is further fueled by a recent filing by NYSE Arca, part of the NYSE Group, for a spot Cardano ETF on behalf of Grayscale. If the filing is approved, it would be Grayscales first standalone investment product for Cardano.According to B2C2 Senior Client Relationship Manager Nikolay Karpenko, the price movements of Litecoin and Cardano are primarily driven by increased market optimism around potential ETF approvals. He also noted that Polymarket currently places Cardanos ETF approval odds at 64%, showing measured optimism but still a strong belief in progress. The movement in the market reflects the growing expectation of institutional adoption of digital assets, especially as the market anticipates more ETFs for non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.Paul Howard, senior director at Wincent, explained that ETF filings for Litecoin and Cardano have helped boost their prices over a short time. Even though non-Bitcoin ETFs have faced lackluster demand in the past, analysts increasingly see them as a key avenue for bringing in institutional and retail investors.The current climate in the U.S. also plays a role in this surge. Under President Donald Trump, the government has shifted towards a more crypto-friendly stance. This shift is expected to reduce regulatory obstacles that previously hindered the digital asset markets growth. As a result, issuers are now more eager to launch spot crypto ETFs that track a range of cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum.These developments have sparked significant momentum in the market for Litecoin and Cardano, with both digital assets showing strong gains amid the growing anticipation of future ETF approvals."

In a research note, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra said that, based on \"discussions from the Asia supply chain,\" it was his understanding that Intel, TSMC, and the U.S. government are discussing plans that would include TSMC sending engineers to Intel's fabrication plants to improve them, creating a greater degree of parity between the two companies' manufacturing capabilities.It is also possible that Intel's foundry division will be spun off into a new joint venture owned by Intel and TSMC.While Intel has long been a leader in the chip industry, it has fallen behind severely in the last few years. The ascendance of rival Nvidia amid the AI boom has left Intel in the dust. The company has been trying to upgrade its chip fabrication capabilities to better compete in the crucial AI market, but its efforts have been largely unsuccessful thus far.TSMC, which manufactures chips in Taiwan for Nvidia and other Intel competitors, is the gold standard in chip manufacturing.

DuPont de Nemours ended Q4 2024 with a 7% increase in net sales year over year with $3.1 billion driven by strong demand within its electronics segment, according to an earnings release Tuesday.The chemical manufacturers net sales for the full year saw a 3% YOY increase to $12.4 billion, driven by rising product demand in electronics, water and medical packaging.Looking ahead, DuPont seeks to generate over $3 billion in net sales in Q1 and up to $12.9 billion for 2025 as it accelerates its plans to spin off its electronics segment by Nov. 1.The electronics and industrials segment saw Q4 net sales increase 11% YOY to $1.5 billion. The segments growth was concentrated in the semiconductor market and driven by the increased adoption of artificial intelligence and strong demand in China, according to the earnings release. The water and protection segment also saw a 6% sales increase in Q4 at approximately $1.4 billion, SVP and CFO Antonella Franzen said in the earnings call Tuesday. The portfolio saw growth in its water infiltration technologies that include reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, ion exchange and nanofiltration.There's some incremental opportunities, not necessarily in 25, but longer term around both DLE, so direct lithium extractions, within the battery space and then also some PFAS opportunity as well, CEO Lori Koch said on the call.Despite stronger sales, the chemicals giant saw a profit loss of $61 million during the period. This is a marked improvement from a $300 million loss a year ago as demand strengthened for electronics, water and medical packaging. Water and protection sales dropped 4% for the full year to $5.4 billion as a result of declining organic sales, according to the earnings report. The company expects to see the electronics business sales grow up to 7% in 2025, according to the Q4 earnings presentation. The projected growth is expected to be driven by the continuing semiconductor sector demand due to ongoing AI adoption, as well as greater transitioning to advanced nodes and normalized sales in China, Franzen said.DuPont forecasts sales for its industrial co-segment to increase up to 4% due to continuing strong demand for medical devices and medical applications in biopharma markets, Franzen said. The company is also targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth in 2025, Koch said.To enable this, we will continue focusing on optimizing our growth opportunities within each business, which includes both continued investment and innovation, as well as driving commercial excellence initiatives, including strategic marketing and sales effectiveness activities, Koch said.Another driver in DuPonts sales gains is its restructuring plan, which the company has been working on since December 2023. The chemical manufacturer approved the cost-reduction plan due to high inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. DuPont is also streamlining operations after it acquired medical device maker Spectrum Plastics Group and sold 80% of its Delrin resin business in 2023.Other actions include hiring a chief commercial officer to drive consistent execution across all of DuPonts businesses, Koch added. The chemical maker hired machinery manufacturer SKF Group executive Lakshmi Yalamanchili as DuPonts VP of commercial excellence effective Feb. 18, the company said in an email to Manufacturing Dive.Recommended Reading DuPont revamps spinoff plans"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After struggling to win much sway in a Biden-era Washington, some of the biggest fintech firms are now getting a lot more facetime on Capitol Hill.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltHow to Build a Neurodiverse CityA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegSpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayGroups that lobby for fintech companies have significantly ramped up their meetings with lawmakers, White House officials and financial regulators since Donald Trump won the election, according to people familiar with the matter.In one example, lobbyists from one firm attended at least 15 meetings last month between both the House and the Senate on fintech issues. Another entity spoke with financial regulators on more occasions in the last month than over the past half a year. The Financial Technology Association, with board members including Chime Financial Inc., Block Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., has also frequented Capitol Hill recently.The discussions  occurring just as Trump appointed-officials populate the US Treasury  have centered on two main areas of future fintech policy. One concerns the relationship fintechs have to have with traditional banks in order to offer their products and services. Another is the fate of the open banking rule  a Biden-era regulation seen as benefitting fintechs which banks have sued to block. That measure isnt among those regulations that Republicans in Congress have signaled theyre considering overturning, according to some of the people.The shift in tone is encouraging, said Phil Goldfeder, chief executive officer of the American Fintech Council, whose members include Affirm Holdings Inc. and LendingClub Corp. Were committed to helping ensure that regulatory frameworks keep pace with evolving consumer needs and technology.Fintech FriendlyTrump has ushered in digital-asset initiatives that augur more openness to fintech firms, which proliferated by offering cheaper products and faster payment alternatives than banks. At the same time, the president has stoked debate over debanking at traditional lenders, saying recently that Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have limited business with conservative clients  which both firms both deny.There is much more opportunity for fintechs under the new leadership and the executive branch, said Andy Barr, a Republican congressman who chairs a subcommittee on financial institutions and monetary policy.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which have key roles overseeing financial services, declined to comment. Representatives for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Treasury Department didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.Fintechs have expanded in part because they face fewer regulations than banks, allowing them to churn out products and services without navigating the same slew of complex rules. Some of those regulatory gaps have raised concerns about the risks to consumers, which were underscored when banking-as-a-service fintech Synapse Financial Technologies Inc. filed for bankruptcy last year, indefinitely trapping millions of dollars of Americans savings.Some firms had tried unsuccessfully to get banking charters under the previous administration  a move that fuels growth by allowing them to receive deposits. Barr, for example, would like to see more clarity around the relationships fintechs have with banks.The administration has signaled more willingness to work with the industry and address some regulatory challenges that held back growth, according to Sima Gandhi, co-founder of the Coalition for Financial Ecosystem Standards, a non-bank industry group.In the prior administration, the word on the street was that the regulators would only engage with banks, said Gandhi, who is also an angel investor in fintech startups. My hope is that within the next two years we will see a lot more guidance for how to innovate.With their lighter scrutiny, banks have long seen fintechs as a competitive threat. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a 2023 report that the banking system was shrinking relative to private markets and fintech, noting many of these new players do not have the same transparency or need to abide by the extensive rules and regulations as traditional banks.One point of tension is the regulation on personal financial data rights  the open banking rule  which the CFPB finalized last year. Under that measure, consumers can demand, download and transfer their highly-coveted data to another lender or financial services provider for free.While fintechs welcomed the move, banking groups sued the CFPB to block it, saying it heightens the likelihood of fraud and jeopardizes data privacy. After the Trump administration swiftly defanged the CFPB, including pausing new regulations, a fintech trade group filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit. Key Republicans havent signaled that they plan to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulation, the people said.Some changes for a key House panel have also altered the tone. French Hill, a Republican representative from Arkansas, now holds the top role on the House Financial Services Committee and is well-known in fintech circles. Hill attended the annual conference of payments startup Stripe Inc. in San Francisco last April and has been spotted at other industry events.Debanking DebateHill has also pledged to investigate debanking, following complaints including from venture capital kingmaker Marc Andreessen that financial regulators were pressuring banks to unfairly target cryptocurrency. That debate escalated recently after Trump called out Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan at the World Economic Forum in Davos, telling him I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives.On Thursday, Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott led a roundtable on debanking with committee Republicans and bank executives including Dimon, who said after that his firm doesnt debank on religious or political grounds. Still, he acknowledged serious problems and said debanking needs to be reviewed.Republicans on Capitol Hill are now closely examining traditional lenders  which some conservatives had already criticized for restrictive policies toward guns and oil drilling.Still, despite optimism surrounding fintech support, theres concern among some venture capitalists which back fintechs that Trumps tendency to swiftly devise and implement policy could have a negative effect on startups.Business is much more influenced by macro conditions than by regulatory temperature, said Amias Gerety, a partner at fintech investment firm QED Investors and the former acting assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury. Its natural to be very optimistic about the de-regulatory agenda  but it will be for naught if we end up in a trade war.--With assistance from Teresa Xie.(Updates with details on CFPB status in 15th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

The security has managed only two positive months over the last year, and in November, it reached its lowest price since March 2020. However, from a contrarian perspective, DLTR has recently pulled back to a historically bullish trendline, suggesting a potential reversal opportunity.The security just came withing one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average, a level that has previously acted as support. According to Schaeffers Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, similar pullbacks occurred twice in the past three years, and both times, Dollar Tree stock posted an average one-month gain of 9.1%. If this historical trend repeats, a comparable move from its current price of $72.50 would position the stock above $79, a level it hasnt seen since early September.Analyst coverage remains largely neutral or bearish, with 17 out of 24 firms rating the equity a hold or worse. A shift in recommendations could act as a catalyst for a rally, particularly if investors begin to reevaluate their positions in the case of positive price action.In the options pits, bearish sentiment appears elevated. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), DLTR's 10-day put/call volume ratio sits in the 72nd percentile of its annual range. This means options traders expect downside. Should the stock begin to rise, an unwinding of these bearish bets could accelerate gains."

        "content": "In the first quarter of 2025, Class I railroads in North America are so far demonstrating varied levels of service performance, according to new metrics mandated by the Surface Transportation Board. The STB now requires major freight railroads to report additional data on on-time percentages, train speeds and terminal dwell times in an effort to increase transparency and accountability.The new STB metrics, which began being collected in September 2024, establish baseline standards for on-time arrival percentage and successful local service percentage. If targets remain unmet, railroads could potentially lose business to competitors, pending shipper petitions to the STB.On-time arrival percentage is calculated as the number of manifest carloads that arrive at their final destination within 24 hours of the original estimated time of arrival, divided by the total number of manifest carloads. Successful local service percentage measures the number of cars placed at their final destination within 24 hours of the commitment, divided by the total number of cars with local service commitments.(Chart: Susquehanna)Entering 2025, rail service has been far more consistent than the 2021-22 experience aside from some disruption out West as a result from elevated imports (hurting BNSF specifically) and unusual weather in the East (hurricanes & irregular Winter storms having outsized affect on CSX), wrote Susquehanna equity analyst Bascome Majors in a February 5 client note. All the data supports the story of general service improvement with velocity up across the board from early 4Q levels. In dwell, CSX on a Y/Y basis has significantly lagged peers, but is showing some sequential recoverymore recently. Rails have performed fairly consistently for On-Time Arrival % except CSX who has had notable weakness vs. peers. BNSF since late November has drastically underperformed peers on local service % though is showing some recovery lapping holiday and winter seasonality. In short, this data supports the sound and consistent service at Union Pacific under Vena and the newfound steadiness for NSC under John Orr which should support respective FY25 margin expansion, but were watching closely to see how the STB will collect and implement this data practically going forward.Western railroads: Union Pacific vs. BNSFUnion Pacific (NYSE: UP) has demonstrated strong service metrics to begin 2025, outperforming rival BNSF Railway in several key areas. UPs manifest on-time arrival percentage averaged 89% in January, compared to 84% for BNSF. UP also maintained higher average train speeds of 24.7 mph versus BNSFs 23.1 mph.Were showing our customers whats possible while at the same time driving productivity, said Jim Vena, CEO of Union Pacific, on the companys Q4 2024 earnings call. Whats exciting for me is that I know were not done. There are more opportunities ahead and we have clear line of sight of how we drive further improvements in 2025.UP did see slightly higher average terminal dwell times of 25.2 hours compared to BNSFs 24.7 hours in January. However, UP has made significant strides in this area over the past year.Notably, 2024 marked an all-time record for terminal dwell, a meaningful improvement in our service, which reduces customers fleet costs through improved cycle times, Vena noted.Canadian railroads: CN vs. CPKCNorth of the border, Canadian National (NYSE: CNI) has maintained an edge over rival Canadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE: CP) in the early weeks of 2025. CN posted an average manifest on-time percentage of 91% in January, while CPKC trailed at 87%.CN also led in average train speeds at 25.9 mph compared to CPKCs 23.8 mph. However, CPKC demonstrated lower average terminal dwell times of 21.3 hours versus CNs 23.1 hours.RTOTC measures the total carloads moved by Class I railroads in the U.S. in a given week. (Chart: SONAR. To learn more about SONAR, click here)Eastern US railroads: Norfolk Southern vs. CSXIn the eastern United States, Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) have shown relatively similar performance levels to start the year, with some variations across metrics. NS reported a slightly higher manifest on-time percentage at 88% compared to CSXs 86% in January.CSX maintained a small advantage in average train speeds at 22.8 mph versus NS at 22.1 mph. Terminal dwell times were nearly identical, with CSX averaging 24.9 hours and NS at 25.1 hours.Importance of new metricsThe implementation of these new service metrics by the STB marks a significant shift in how railroad performance is measured and reported. By focusing on on-time percentages and local service success, the STB aims to create a more comprehensive picture of how well railroads are meeting customer needs.These metrics are critical for shippers and regulators to assess railroad performance, said rail industry analyst Jason Seidl of Cowen. They provide a more granular view of service quality beyond just the traditional measures of train speed and dwell time.The STBs move comes after periods of service disruptions in recent years, particularly during the post-pandemic recovery. By establishing these new reporting requirements, the board hopes to incentivize railroads to maintain high service levels and provide more transparency to customers.Union Pacifics momentumAmong the Class I railroads, Union Pacific appears to have built significant momentum in service improvements heading into 2025. The companys strong performance in on-time percentages and train speeds reflects its strategic focus on operational excellence.We operate the largest, most complex rail network in North America and with it comes challenges and opportunities, Vena said. The team understands our goal is to deliver whats possible from this franchise. We intend to do that as an industry leader that keeps raising the bar as we drive value for our shareholders.UPs management team has emphasized that improved service is key to winning new business and driving growth. The companys ability to handle increased volumes while maintaining strong service metrics will be closely watched throughout 2025.Our 2024 performance demonstrates that our strategy to operate with a buffer and connect more closely to our customers is paying dividends, both in terms of meeting our customer commitments and as a direct result winning new business, Vena noted.As we move deeper into 2025, industry observers will monitor how well the rails maintain and improve their service levels in the face of potential economic headwinds and regulatory changes. The new STB metrics provide an additional tool for tracking these efforts and holding railroads accountable for their service commitments.The post Local service still a sticking point for Class I railroads appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "A cybersecurity play makes another return to public markets.SailPoint (SAIL) is poised to start trading at the Nasdaq on Thursday. The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top end of its targeted range of $21 to $23, raising $1.38 billion in proceeds.The company's valuation ahead of its IPO stood at $12.6 billion. Its closest competitor, Okta (OKTA), is valued at $16.8 billion.\"The market seems to be hungry today for what we call growth at scale with profitability. If you've built a pretty large business, you're able to grow that business and do so profitably, that's kind of the magic combo of today. And we were that profile. I think [investors on the roadshow] found that interesting,\" SailPoint founder and CEO Mark McClain told me on Yahoo Finance (video above).The identity management tech firm is no stranger to public markets.Thoma Bravo took SailPoint public on Nov. 18, 2017, around the same time as quasi-competitor Okta debuted.On its first day of trading, the stock finished up 8.3% at $13. The company had priced its IPO then at $12 a share.Podcast: Inside the future of tech with Microsoft's Bill GatesAt the time, SailPoint touted sales of $118.3 million and growth of 34% in the nine months before its IPO. It had a $13 million net loss.Thoma Bravo took the company private in 2022 for $6.9 billion or $65.25 a share.Today, Sailpoint is a more mature company operationally and financially  though it's producing losses despite a shift to a software-as-a-service model.For the year ended Jan. 31, 2025, the company estimated in its prospectus it would earn $875 million to $877 million in annual recurring revenue. That would be up about 41% year over year.SailPoint didn't disclose guidance for its fiscal year's bottom line.Through the nine months ended Oct. 31, 2024, SailPoint's net loss totaled $235.8 million, better than the $308 million loss a year earlier. McClain says the company is profitable on a non-GAAP basis.SailPoint will be defined as a controlled company now that it's public. Thoma Bravo is expected to own 88% of SailPoint post-IPO, and it will have final say over board-level decisions. It will also be able to nominate members to SailPoint's board.SailPoint is the first big test of the tech IPO market in 2025, which is expected to see well-known names such as Stripe potentially debut as companies bank on a friendlier regulatory backdrop under President Trump.Renaissance Macro expects a \"banner\" year for IPOs this year, with an estimated volume range of 155 to 195 companies coming to market. They could collectively raise $40 billion to $55 billion in funding.\"There's generally a sense that we're going to move to a less regulatory-oriented administration. Now, I don't think it's going to all go away, of course, but I think the idea that business will be a little freer to run without as much focus from the regulators, that probably sets up a better backdrop,\" McClain said.Last year saw some improvement in IPOs, however.The number of IPOs jumped by 38% and proceeds rose 48%, according to EY.

        "content": "Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has added a whopping $2.8 trillion to its market capitalization on the back of soaring demand for its data center chips, which are the gold standard for developing artificial intelligence (AI). At the same time, Nvidia stock is trading down 11% from its record high set in early January 2025 following a sharp sell-off over the past month.The sell-off was sparked by news that China-based research lab, DeepSeek, has found a way to train competitive AI models with a fraction of the computing power (and financial resources) of its American peers. Investors feared this would trigger a collapse in the demand for data center chips, thus crushing Nvidia's core business.On Feb. 26, Nvidia will report its latest financial results for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31), and I think the information it contains will squash some of the recent investor concerns. Here's how I predict the stock will react once the results hit the wires.Nvidia's H100 graphics processor (GPU) was the hottest AI data center chip in the world during 2023, helping the company capture an incredible 98% market share. It remains a top seller but it was superseded by the H200, and then an entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture.The Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system can perform AI inference at 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system, paving the way for developers to deploy the most advanced AI models to date. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors demand was \"insane\" shortly after Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024, and from what we know so far, sales are living up to expectations.However, the DeepSeek saga rocked Wall Street's confidence in January. The Chinese start-up revealed it spent just $5.6 million to train its V3 AI model, yet it matches the performance of some of the best models from American start-ups like OpenAI, which have invested tens of billions of dollars to reach this point. Moreover, DeepSeek used older generations of Nvidia's GPUs, which left investors wondering whether AI developers really need the latest and greatest Blackwell chips.But some of those concerns have since been put to bed by Nvidia's largest customers. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks a drop in training workloads will be offset by inference workloads, which are now consuming an increasing amount of computing power because newer AI models spend more time \"thinking\" (which is known as test-time scaling). Meta expects to spend up to $65 billion on AI data center infrastructure during 2025, up from $39.2 billion last year, so it certainly isn't pulling back.Alphabet also plans to significantly increase its hardware investments this year, forecasting a record $75 billion in capital expenditures (capex). Then there is Amazon, which recently told investors it could spend over $100 billion in 2025 to build more AI infrastructure.If all of Nvidia's top customers are significantly increasing their investments in chips and data centers, it's hard to envision a scenario where the company's financial results disappoint. Wall Street's consensus forecast (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Nvidia's fourth-quarter revenue will come in at $38.1 billion, which is even higher than the company's own estimate of $37.5 billion.If previous quarters are anything to go by, around 88% of that revenue will come from the data center segment, led by GPU sales.The Q4 result would take Nvidia's total fiscal 2025 revenue to a record $129.3 billion, representing 112% growth compared to fiscal 2024. But the company's outlook for the future is also something Wall Street will be watching closely. Analysts are currently forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue for Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter, so if management's guidance tops that number, it will be a great sign that DeepSeek concerns are mostly overblown.When Nvidia reported its last set of results for the third quarter on Nov. 20, its stock fell by 7% over the next five days or so. Short-term fluctuations in any stock are mostly just noise, and Nvidia had recovered almost completely just two weeks later. It speaks to the importance of maintaining a long-term view, especially with an opportunity like AI, which is likely to unfold over a period of years, not weeks or months.The recent DeepSeek-related dip in Nvidia stock has created an enticing opportunity for investors. The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.1, which is a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 59.2.Plus, Wall Street expects Nvidia to deliver $4.44 in earnings per share during the current fiscal year 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 29.2:In other words, assuming Wall Street's numbers prove to be accurate, Nvidia stock would have to soar by 102% this year just for its P/E ratio to trade in line with its 10-year average.If Nvidia's Q4 report adds further evidence that DeepSeek-related developments aren't hurting demand for GPUs, its stock is likely destined for new record highs over the next few months. Considering the recent commentary and capex forecasts from the company's biggest customers, I think the upcoming report on Feb. 26 is far more likely to deliver a positive surprise than a negative one.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "By Emma RumneyLONDON (Reuters) -Heineken's shares surged 12% on Wednesday as the Dutch brewer predicted more growth next year after producing forecast-beating profits in 2024, and said it would launch a 1.5 billion euro share buyback.The world's No.2 brewer's shares saw their biggest one-day gain since 1989 after it reported 8.3% growth in annual organic operating profit.This surpassed analysts' forecasts of 5.3% and exceeded the company's own expectations of an increase of up to 8%. The shares have been on a downward trajectory since July, when the company's first-half results missed forecasts.The company's fourth-quarter revenues and volumes also increased more than analysts had forecast.The performance provides more reassurance to investors who have criticised Heineken for both over- and under-promising with its outlook, and for volatility in its results.The company's 1.5 billion euro ($1.55 billion) share buyback programme will span two years, and Heineken forecast further growth in operating profit of between 4% and 8% in 2025.CEO Dolf van den Brink told journalists the group's solid annual performance overall was thanks to continued investments in growth.Lea Saenz, portfolio manager at Heineken investor Flornoy Ferri, said strong volume growth was one factor helping to drive the share reaction given investor concerns that the beer industry faces lower long-term consumption.Heineken's results were therefore \"super positive for the feeling and the mood for the entire sector\", she said, adding its share buyback also added to optimism by highlighting management confidence over the next two years.In markets like the United States, some drinkers, especially younger ones, have been swapping out beer and wine for spirits and cocktails.The industry has also faced years of high cost inflation, forcing price hikes that have hit volumes.Those pressures are easing, but U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed or actual tariffs on Mexico, Canada, Europe and steel and aluminium potentially could put pressure on some brewers' operations.Van den Brink told journalists that Heineken had taken such risks into account in its 2025 outlook, and did not anticipate any major impact given the U.S. accounts for less than 5% of Heineken's global revenues.A company spokesperson added that Heineken imports finished cans into the United States and it is therefore not directly impacted by tariffs on raw aluminium.Earlier in February, rival Carlsberg also reported annual operating profit growth at the top of its guided range and forecast higher than anticipated growth for 2025.($1 = 0.9654 euros)(Reporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Tom Hogue, Sherry Jacob-Phillips, Kate Mayberry and Jane Merriman)"

        "content": "Optical and photonics component seller Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ: LITE) delivered an outstanding performance on the stock market last year, registering healthy gains of 61% as investors took note of the growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the company's business, and it looks like the stock's red-hot run is here to stay in 2025.Lumentum released fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended Dec. 28, 2024) on Feb. 6. The company's growth trajectory continued improving during the quarter thanks to the robust performance of its cloud and networking business. It is worth noting that Lumentum finished fiscal 2024 on a sour note, as the weak demand for its optical components in the industrial segment and from telecom providers led to a sharp decline in its revenue and earnings.However, fiscal 2025 is turning out to be a much better year for the company as the demand for its optical components deployed in AI servers for high-speed data transmission is growing rapidly. Let's examine Lumentum's latest results and check why this company has room for more upside.Lumentum reported a 10% year-over-year increase in its fiscal Q2 revenue to $402 million, driven mainly by the AI-powered demand for its components in the cloud and networking business. More specifically, the cloud and networking segment's revenue increased 18% from the year-ago period, offsetting the 21% drop in the industrial business.The cloud and networking business now accounts for 84% of Lumentum's top line, and the growing influence of this segment on Lumentum's top line should pave the way for stronger growth going forward. This explains why the midpoint of Lumentum's fiscal Q3 guidance of $417.5 million would translate into a 14% jump from the year-ago period.Lumentum management points out that it is witnessing healthy demand from hyperscale cloud customers. More specifically, the demand from its largest hyperscale customer increased during the quarter, and it started volume shipments to a new customer. Even better, Lumentum's components are in the qualification phase at another customer. Management estimates that it will begin volume shipments to this new customer in fiscal Q4.The good part is that the demand for Lumentum's components used in data centers is so strong that the company is increasing its manufacturing capacity. So, it won't be surprising to see Lumentum's growth indeed picking up as the year progresses. Analysts are forecasting the company to end the year with an 18% increase in revenue to $1.6 billion, followed by healthy growth over the next couple of years as well.Lumentum management points out that its \"engagement with cloud customers and AI infrastructure providers on their long-term technology and product roadmap has reached an all-time high.\" The shipments of its externally modulated lasers (EMLs), which enable high-speed data transmission with the help of fiber-optic cables, hit a record last quarter thanks to AI-related demand.Looking ahead, Lumentum's EML shipments are likely to head higher as it expects to gain more market share on account of new design wins for AI applications. What's more, the data center interconnect (DCI) market that Lumentum is targeting is expected to grow by 71% over the next four years, according to one estimate, with AI set to play a central role in this market's healthy growth. So, Lumentum could be at the beginning of a terrific long-term growth opportunity.Another thing worth noting is that Lumentum's margins are getting better on account of higher manufacturing utilization and its focus on keeping costs under check. As a result, Lumentum's non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin jumped by six percentage points year over year in the previous quarter. This led to stronger growth of 75% in the company's bottom line last quarter to $0.42 per share.Consensus estimates are projecting a 73% increase in the company's bottom line this year to $1.75 per share, followed by outstanding growth over the next two years as well.Assuming Lumentum could hit $4.74 per share in earnings in fiscal 2027 and trades at 27.6 times earnings at that time (in line with the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $131 in just over two years. That would be a 60% jump from current levels, suggesting that this AI stock has the potential to fly higher even after clocking impressive gains last year.Before you buy stock in Lumentum, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Lumentum wasnt one of them.

        "content": "German industrial conglomerate Siemens (OTC: SIEGY) was a somewhat under-the-radar winner on the stock exchange on Friday. The company's shares enjoyed a more than 1% bump in price, as investors continued to disseminate the latest earnings release and two analysts raised their price targets. Siemens' slight rise was robust enough to beat the flatlining S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) that day.Friday's analyst moves were a reaction to the earnings release, which was published Thursday morning. This revealed that Siemens' first quarter of its fiscal 2025 featured a 3% year-over-year increase in revenue to 18.4 billion euros ($19.2 billion).The company reported that orders were up in all of its industrial segments save for Mobility; however, this dip resulted in an overall 7% slump to slightly more than 20 billion euros.Regarding profitability, thanks largely to an asset divestment, Siemens managed to crank its headline net income 52% higher, to almost 3.9 billion euros for the period, shaking out to 4.86 euros per share. The first quarter of fiscal 2024 saw it net 2.5 billion euros.According to Reuters, the consensus analyst estimate for revenue was barely over 18 billion euros. That for the company's foundational industrial segment was 2.4 billion euros; the company earned 2.5 billion euros.Another positive was a remark by CEO Roland Busch, who clearly referenced the aims of the Trump administration by saying that the company would be able to thrive \"even in the face of the current, politically motivated tariff regimes and potential countermeasures.\"With that solid quarterly performance, the pair of analysts made upward adjustments to their price targets. Morgan Stanley's Max Yates now feels that Siemens' stock is worth 240 euros per share, up by 5 euros from his previous level. His peer Mark Fielding at RBC Capital increased his price target to 245 euros from 220 euros.

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ryder-not-counting-stronger-freight-160310259.html",
        "published": "2025-02-13T16:03:10Z",
        "source": "FreightWaves",
        "content": "A summary of Ryders financial performance can be found here.With freight markets not providing much of a boost to Ryder Systems operations in 2024  a trend projected to continue into 2025  the companys fourth-quarter earnings call focused heavily on Ryders transformation to a more diversified operating model with less emphasis on truck rentals.The fourth-quarter performance at Ryder (NYSE: R) was not particularly bad. Operating revenue rose to $2.6 billion from $2.4 billion a year earlier, earnings per share climbed 17% to $3.45 from $2.95, and free cash flow went to a positive $133 million from negative $54 million a year ago.But the overall numbers told a story of a company that saw most of its revenue growth come from the February acquisition of Cardinal Logistics, which slotted into the Dedicated Transport Services (DTS) division of Ryder.Revenue at its benchmark Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) sector was flat at $1.3 billion; it was up just 4% at Supply Chain Solutions (SCS), a contract logistics provider, to just over $1 billion. But revenue was up to $472 million from $324 million a year ago at DTS, mostly from the Cardinal acquisition.CEO Robert Sanchez has spoken on other earnings calls about changes at Ryder aimed at making the company less reliant on FMS. And on the Wednesday call to discuss the fourth quarter, it was one of the first things he discussed.Backed by a slide, he rattled off the comparisons, using 2018 as a base year for pre-transformation. Earnings per share in 2018 were $5.95 for the year; in 2024, they were $12. Return on equity was 13% in 2018 compared to 16% in 2024. Earnings before taxes at FMS were $516 million last year, versus $340 million in 2018. And the combined EBT at SCS and DTS rose last year to $457 million from $191 million.The other key number: Growth of the SCS and DTS businesses resulted in those two segments providing 61% of Ryders revenue last year, compared to 44% in the 2018 base year.Management on the analyst call spent much of its time talking about the long term and the impact of the transformation. As Sanchez said, the company generated a return on equity of 16% in the quarter during an extended freight cycle downturn [that] reflects the benefits of our initiatives focused on enhancing returns.Sanchez referred several times to Ryders growing reliance on contractual business, which he said had strength ... that continued to demonstrate the enhanced quality of the portfolio and increased resilience of our business model.Looking ahead to 2025, Sanchez said Ryder expects a muted growth environment, reflecting freight market conditions. The projected growth in revenue this year of only about 2% and the 8% to 17% projected growth in EPS assumes continued contractual earnings growth and a very modest improvement in rental demand later in the year, Sanchez said.Ryders assumption of a continuing weak freight market with minor improvements means organic growth plays only a small role in the companys getting from $12 per share in 2024 to at least $14 this year, which is what the company forecasts as its minimum earnings per share range in the first financial outlook it has provided for 2025.A chart provided by Ryder sees $1-per-share gains out of FMS contractual business, with most of that attributed to earlier-discussed initiatives in the companys lease business and maintenance rather than organic growth.The company also estimates 85 cents per share out of SCS and DTS, with that growth heavily dependent on synergies from the Cardinal acquisition rather than new revenue. Ryder also sees gains in what it calls its omnichannel solutions offering at SCS. On its website, Ryder describes the omnichannel solution as featuring warehouse & distribution management, managed transportation solutions, e-commerce fulfillment, and last mile delivery.The growth or efficiency initiatives that Sanchez spoke of as fueling higher profitability in 2025  since the company doesnt expect  a stronger freight market to contribute much  were described by the CEO as representing structural changes were making in our business and are not depending on cycle upturns.In response to an analysts question, Sanchez summed up Ryders view of the freight market as flattish  a term other Ryder executives had used during the call.Were not seeing an upturn yet, he said, with the market moving sideways, rental moving seasonally but not a significant upturn. Miles racked up by vehicles on lease are also flattish, he said, and then on the used vehicle side, were still talking about single-digit declines in pricing.Rental patterns will be seasonal for most of 2025, Sanchez said, with slightly better than seasonal trends later in the year.With used vehicle sales down sharply between the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2024, and prices falling too, that is not seen as a driver of growth in 2025. Gains from the sale of used vehicles are expected to be below 2024 levels, Sanchez said. Prices are expected to be in line with this year, but stronger than residual values that are assumed for depreciation, a relationship that does boost the companys bottom line.Part of Ryders optimistic outlook is based on its belief that the outsourcing of logistics activities by companies is locked in as a secular trend, as Sanchez referred to it. But at present, driver availability that is less of an issue than it was a few years ago has slowed that trend.Steve Sensing, the president of SCS and DTS, which would be on the front line of hiring drivers and participating in the spot market for freight, said rates are continuing to bounce on the bottom, which slows companies looking to outsource their logistics needs to a company like Ryder.Those customers in the past traded service for cost, he said. But if the driver market tightens and freight markets strengthen, he said, we expect there to be opportunities for growth in DTS.Or as Sanchez said in his prepared remarks, As freight capacity tightens and driver availability becomes more challenging, we expect to see incremental sales opportunities and improved revenue growth in DTS as private fleets seek solutions to address this pain point.More articles by John KingstonRyder acquires mobile fleet maintenance provider Pit StopRyder launches technology lab with FreightTech acquisition BatonRyders debt rating upgraded by S&PThe post Ryder not counting on stronger freight market in 25, so it touts broader trends appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) recently reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue of just under $12 billion came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. But adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 were well below. Nonetheless, shares have been a major winner for investors -- up 125% just in the past 24 months. You're probably wondering if it's time to take a ride with Uber. Could this transportation-as-a-service stock be your ticket to becoming a millionaire by 2035?Uber's gross bookings jumped 18% in the fourth quarter to $44.2 billion. The performance was broad-based, with both the mobility and delivery segment putting up 18% gains. This helped propel a 20% increase in revenue.On a run-rate basis, Uber is bringing in $48 billion in sales and handling a whopping $177 billion in gross booking value. However, there is still lots of growth potential ahead. According to consensus analyst estimates, Uber's revenue is projected to increase at a compound annual rate of 14.4% over the next three years, which is a healthy outlook.The leadership team sees a ton of opportunity with the Uber One membership. It currently has 30 million members, 60% higher than the year-ago period. Investors are probably worried about the threat of autonomous vehicle (AV) driving for Uber's business model and growth trajectory. After all, if Tesla is able to commercialize this technology and launch a global fleet of robotaxis, it could seriously undermine what Uber has built. Without drivers, these robotaxis could be a lot cheaper, which could win over consumers.Luckily, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is well aware of the rapidly changing tech backdrop. And he's not letting Uber rest on its laurels.  \"We have conviction that Uber will be the indispensable go-to-market partner for AV players,\" he said on the Q4 2024 earnings call. \"This is undoubtedly one of our top priorities, and we're investing a lot of technical, strategic, and management attention to this topic with lots more to come.\"Uber has a direct customer relationship with 171 million users across the globe who all have developed a habit of using the app. That makes it a valuable partner as collaborations with AV players continue to develop.Uber's bottom-line performance missed analysts' expectations. However, investors should still appreciate how profitable this business has become. Uber reported $2.8 billion in operating income in 2024, translating to a 6.4% margin. This is a massive improvement from the $8.6 billion operating loss registered in 2019.Consensus analyst estimates see Uber's operating income soaring at a yearly pace of 54.4% between 2024 and 2027. That forecast is much faster than the sales expectations. This demonstrates a scalable business model for Uber, which is the trend we've seen in the past.Uber's largest expense categories are sales and marketing and research and development. What investors don't want to see are drastic cuts here that impact the ability to grow the user base and gross bookings. But there is certainly leverage here, something that should lead to improving profitability over time.Shares of Uber have catapulted higher in the past couple of years. Solid fundamental performance has certainly boosted investor sentiment toward the company.The valuation looks reasonable. Shares trade at a forward P/E ratio of 22.7. This is a category-leading enterprise whose profits are soaring and that still has growth potential. That means that Uber at least looks like a smart stock to buy today that has the chance to outperform the broader market over the next few years.But unless you have a massive sum of capital you can invest upfront, I'm not confident that the business can make you a millionaire in a decade. It's not reasonable to expect the monster share-price gains over the last 24 months to continue indefinitely.

Freeport has local refining capacity, but is seeking to keep exporting concentrate due to a fire last October at its Manyar smelterin East Java.The miner will start loading cargoes destined for China on Friday in anticipation of receiving an export licence by month end, according to one source with direct knowledge of the matter.A shipment of copper concentrate from the company's mine at Grasberg, the world's second largest active copper mine, is expected to depart by late February, a second source said.\"Storage is becoming a big problem. We need to start shifting it,\" the first source said.Indonesia's trade ministry said last week it would support Freeport resuming copper concentrate exports.PT Freeport Indonesia did not respond to questions about the shipments sent via text. A spokesperson said separately they expected the government would accommodate a plan to resume exports.Indonesia's mining ministry did not respond to questions about the shipments from Reuters sent via text message.Freeport presold cargoes of copper concentrate in January with a contingent claim that the contracts will take effect only if they successfully renew their export licence, said a third source with direct knowledge of the matter.Should exports resume, it will relieve, although not reverse, a shortage of copper concentrate that has hit the profits of smelters.Treatment charges - fees paid by miners to smelters for converting raw materials into metal - stood at a negative $12.5 a ton on February 7, the lowest level yet recorded in information provider Fastmarkets' index tracing data back to 2013.(Reporting by Amy Lv in Beijing and Pratima Desai in London; Additional reporting by Fransiska Nangoy in Jakarta; Editing by Lewis Jackson in Beijing and Jan Harvey)"

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on Friday disclosed a new investment in alcoholic beverages producer Constellation Brands, and said it has reduced its holdings in four banks, including Citigroup and Bank of America.In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of December 31, Berkshire also disclosed it has stopped selling shares of Apple, which remained its largest common stock investment at $75.1 billion.The filing nonetheless suggests that Berkshire remains concerned about valuations, after selling $133.2 billion of stock--primarily 490 million Apple shares--between January and September 2024, and letting its cash stake grow to $325.2 billion.Berkshire owned $1.24 billion of Constellation stock at year end, after purchasing 5.62 million shares in the fourth quarter.In after-hours trading, Constellation's share price rose 6.7%, reflecting what investors view as Buffett's seal of approval regardless of whether the revered billionaire investor personally did the buying.Constellation did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Its beer brands include Corona and Modelo Especial, which in 2023 surpassed Bud Light as the top-selling beer in the United States, while its wine portfolio include Meiomi, Robert Mondavi and Kim Crawford.Berkshire also owns a small stake in Diageo, whose brands include Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker Scotch and Smirnoff vodka.To go with the alcohol, Berkshire also invests in Domino's Pizza, and boosted its stake by 86% in the quarter.In Friday's filing, Berkshire said it lowered its Citigroup stake 74% to 14.6 million shares, and its Bank of America stake, until recently its second-largest common stock holding, 15% to 680.2 million shares.Berkshire has reduced its Bank of America stake by one-third since July, when it owned 1.03 billion shares.It has also unwound a small portion of the 700 million Bank of America shares it bought in 2017, when it redeemed $5 billion of preferred stock acquired six years earlier and used proceeds to exercise warrants at $7.14 per share.Bank of America shares have since risen more than sixfold.During the fourth quarter, Berkshire also reduced its stakes in Capital One and Brazilian fintech lender Nu Holdings.It exited one stock altogether, cosmetics store chain Ulta Beauty, which it owned for less than a year.Friday's filing does not say which investments are Buffett's and which are from Berkshire portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who typically handle smaller Berkshire investments.Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and its annual report expected on February 22 will include its year-end financial results.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Diane Craft)"

        "published": "2025-02-12T11:15:00Z",
        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump hosted an event at the White House that featured some of the biggest names in the technology industry.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Japanese tech mogul Masayoshi Son are leading the charge for an infrastructure project called Stargate, which aims to invest $500 billion into American technology companies over the next four years.While initial reactions to this initiative were positive, the euphoria was short-lived. Just days after the Stargate announcement, investors were focused on a new AI start-up out of China called DeepSeek.Below, I'm going to explore some of the main talking points surrounding DeepSeek and assess if the newest AI darling poses a threat to Trump's Stargate agenda.What makes DeepSeek such a point of contention is that the company claims to have trained its models using older hardware compared to what AI companies in the U.S. are leveraging. For example, over the last couple of years, you've likely heard business leaders talking about Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPU) -- namely the Hopper and Blackwell architectures. These are Nvidia's most sophisticated -- and expensive -- chips.However, DeepSeek's developers claim to have used older GPUs and less expensive infrastructure from Nvidia, primarily a cluster of H800 chips.This is important because the team at DeepSeek is subtly implying that high-caliber AI can be developed for much less than what OpenAI and its cohorts have been spending. If that's the case, it's reasonable that investors would expect a major pullback on AI infrastructure spending. While I acknowledge the logic supporting the bear narrative here, let's explore if this argument is really holding up.Over the last couple of weeks, several big players in the AI revolution reported earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2024.Microsoft: Microsoft is a big investor in OpenAI, and over the last couple of years, the company integrated new AI-powered services throughout its ecosystem. One of the most important areas where Microsoft is leveraging AI is its cloud computing business, Azure. In the last 12 months, the company plowed more than $55 billion into capital expenditures (capex) -- a lot of which is allocated toward the company's ongoing AI efforts. Microsoft's management appears committed to these infrastructure projects, as management told investors that the company's capex budget for this year should be in the range of $80 billion.Meta Platforms: Meta hasn't been afraid of doubling down on its AI vision. In 2023, the company spent $28 billion in capex. Last year, Meta's infrastructure spending rose by 40% -- coming in at around $39 billion. During the company's recent earnings call, Meta's management said that capex spending in 2025 will be in the range of $60 to $65 billion -- representing an increase of 67% year over year at the high end of the range.Alphabet: Alphabet spent the last couple of years integrating AI services into its own ecosystem in an effort to diversify its business from heavy reliance on advertising and unlock new opportunities to compete more directly with Microsoft and Amazon. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, investors learned that Alphabet plans to spend around $75 billion on capex in 2025, representing an increase of 43% compared to spending levels in 2024.Amazon: Amazon has also spent considerable capital on AI infrastructure over the last couple of years. In particular, the company poured billions into a start-up, Anthropic, which competes directly with OpenAI. Integrating Anthropic into the cloud business, in particular, helped the company reaccelerate sales and widen profit margins in Amazon Web Services (AWS). During the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, management alluded that Amazon could spend roughly $105 billion in AI infrastructure this year, as demand for AWS remains robust. Should Amazon spend around the indicated levels, that would represent an increase of 27% compared to capex in 2024.In the days following DeepSeek's initial headlines, Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp told CNBC that the advancements from the Chinese start-up should inspire U.S. technology businesses to double down on their own AI developments and continue investing in innovation.Considering the largest technology companies in the world (not just the U.S.) are planning to spend over $320 billion in AI infrastructure just this year underscores Karp's commentary. All told, I don't think DeepSeek is derailing Stargate in any sense.As of now, AI's biggest spenders appear to be spending even more. If anything, the arrival of DeepSeek has become a tailwind for domestic AI infrastructure investment -- which should bode well for the Stargate project over the next several years.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It expects an accretion of about 10 cents to its adjusted EPS in the first full year.Goldman Sachs & Co.

        "content": "Airbnb (ABNB) stock surged more than 14% on Friday following an earnings beat as CEO Brian Chesky said he wanted to make the vacation home marketplace app more than a destination for people seeking a place to stay.\"We want the Airbnb app, kind of similar to Amazon (AMZN), to be one place you go for all of your traveling and living needs,\" Chesky said during the company's post-earnings conference call Thursday. \"A place to stay is just really, frankly, a very small part of the overall equation.\"In its shareholder letter on Thursday, the company announced plans to launch \"one or a couple of businesses\" adjacent to travel every year for the next four or five years.Chesky didn't give details on which specific businesses would be launched, but noted Amazon's (AMZN) path, which first started selling books, then DVDS and CDs.Chesky noted that Airbnb is used by 1.6 billion devices a year. People typically use the app once or twice a year. He would like to raise that rate to once or twice a week.Airbnb said that the launching and scaling of new businesses around the app will require an investment of $200 million to $250 million, which will have an impact on near-term margins.\"While we are encouraged by ABNB's strong start to 2025, margins are expected to compress as much as 200bps & new businesses, incl. Experiences, come with execution risk,\" wrote JPMorgan analysts on Friday. The firm reaffirmed its Neutral rating and $160 price target on the stock.Meanwhile, Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni recommended a Hold on the stock, with a $165 price target.\"We prefer to stay on the sidelines until gaining greater visibility into contributions from new products and timing for sponsored listings,\" he said.Airbnb's revenue in the fourth quarter jumped 12% year over year to $2.48 billion, beating analyst expectations of $2.42 billion.Gross bookings also jumped 14% to $17.6 billion, higher than Wall Street expectations for $17.19 billion.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This has occurred five other times over the last three years, after which the stock was higher one month later 80% of the time with an average 21.2% gain.From its current perch at $15.61, a move of similar magnitude would put ADMA at $18.91 -- much closer to its Nov. 11 record peak of $23.64.

        "content": "(Bloomberg)  Meta Platforms Inc. (META), after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.The company is making a significant investment into the category  futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks  and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasnt been announced.Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesnt plan to build a Meta-branded robot  something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.s Optimus  but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.The core technologies weve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics, Andrew Bosworth, Metas chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the companys advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Metas advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs, Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.Metas goal is to provide what Googles Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk has said that his companys Optimus robot will eventually be sold to consumers and could cost around $30,000. Tesla is beginning limited production this year. Other businesses also have made headway. Boston Dynamics, for instance, has already brought products to market for automation in warehouses. Some companies are focused on selling to businesses and manufacturers, while Metas intention is to sell into homes.Humanoids are an evolution of the work companies have been doing in autonomous vehicles. They use similar underlying technologies and require large amounts of data and AI processing. But while the safety stakes are lower  roaming a persons home instead of traveling 50 miles per hour on an open road  Meta executives believe humanoids are more challenging because every persons home has a different layout, while city streets are fairly standardized.Meta will build some of its own hardware, use off-the-shelf components and work with existing manufacturers as soon as it can, said the people with knowledge of the project. They added that building prototypes and hardware is key for testing ahead of deploying a platform, even if Meta itself doesnt ultimately release a branded product.The company is pitching its work as the platform of choice for robot development, one of the people said, adding that the goal was to make Metas Llama software a foundation for robotics researchers around the world.Meta will also seek to develop tools for robot safety, addressing possible dangers such as a persons hand getting caught in an actuator or another part of a humanoid robot. There are also issues related to power safety, such as how a robot powers down or stops functioning mid-task if it runs out of power.While the official push into humanoid robots is new for Meta, the companys FAIR, or Fundamental AI Research Group, has been exploring and publishing papers on robotics work for months. Apple recently started publishing AI papers related to robotics work as well.One person with knowledge of the project said that Meta believes humanoids are still a couple of years away from being widely available  and it could be years before the companys platform is ready to underpin third-party products. But it will become a major focus for Meta and the broader tech industry, the person said.2025 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "Shares of advertising-technology (adtech) company The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) got smashed on Thursday after the company reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024. As of 10 a.m. ET, The Trade Desk stock was down a staggering 31% and it suddenly finds itself down 40% from its 52-week high.In Q4, The Trade Desk's revenue of $741 million came in below management's guidance and analysts' expectations, which is rare for this company. Founder and CEO Jeff Green highlighted the company's successes during the year but conceded that he was \"Disappointed that we fell short of our own expectations in the fourth quarter.\"The Trade Desk's forward guidance is also coming into play today. In Q4, its revenue was up by 22% year over year. But it's guiding for revenue of at least $575 million in the upcoming first quarter of 2025. That's only 17% growth from the first quarter of 2024.In short, The Trade Desk's growth is decelerating despite its leadership position in the connected TV adtech space. And that has its base of growth investors concerned.Even with the 40% drop from its highs, The Trade Desk stock is up more than 2,600% over the last 10 years. But the ride hasn't been smooth. As the chart below shows, it's dropped 40% or more several times.Even after the drop in price, The Trade Desk stock trades at a pricey 17 times sales. Its sales growth is slowing, which is concerning, especially considering it's slowing faster than management expected. That said, the company estimates its market opportunity at over $900 billion, which represents significant upside opportunity. And its guidance for 17% growth in Q1 is nothing to sneeze at.I'm not saying it's a bargain today or that there is nothing to worry about. But I am saying that The Trade Desk is a remarkably consistent company and has been down before, meaning it warrants closer consideration from investors after today's drop.Before you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and The Trade Desk wasnt one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Albemarle, the world's largest producer of lithium, swung to a quarterly profit as cost cuts helped offset low prices of the electric vehicle battery metal, but adjusted results reported on Wednesday fell short of analysts' expectations.Shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company rose 2.5% to $78.50 in after-hours trading.Albemarle, like many of its peers, has struggled over the past 18 months to weather a lithium supply glut brought on in part by overproduction in China.As a result, Albemarle executives last year said they would cull staff and cancel expansion projects - including a key U.S. lithium refinery - in a plan to save hundreds of millions of dollars and protect the company's balance sheet and operations across the Americas, Asia and Australia.For 2025, Albemarle now plans to spend $700 million to $800 million, roughly half of last year's capital budget.\"We are taking decisive actions to reduce costs, optimize our conversion network and increase efficiencies to preserve our long-term competitive position,\" CEO Kent Masters said in a press release.The company posted a fourth-quarter profit of $33.6 million, or 29 cents per share, compared to a loss of $617.7 million, or $5.26 per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time items, such as restructuring costs related to the layoffs, Albemarle lost $1.09 per share. By that measure, analysts expected a loss of 70 cents per share, according to LSEG data.The company's Energy Storage division, which sells lithium, reported a $1.1 billion drop in revenue caused by a 53% slide in prices the company receives for its lithium.Albemarle plans to discuss the quarterly results on a Thursday morning conference call.(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Chris Reese and Bill Berkrot)"

The company had also already accounted for some anticipated fourth-quarter losses in the third quarter.Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.19 a share, the company said Wednesday in a statement, outpacing analysts average estimate of 92 cents.The shares closed up 15% Wednesday in New York, their biggest gain since October 1999.CVS is trying to turn around its drugstore chain and insurance business, where profit has been hit by underpricing of plans and cuts to quality ratings that help determine payments from US health programs. Chief Executive Officer David Joyner, who took the helm in October, has said that a recovery will take years.They company is encouraged by recent conversations with the government about payment rates for Medicare Advantage, a private version of the US health program for older and disabled people, Joyner said on a conference call. Rates proposed by the government didnt take into account increased health-care use and costs, he said.The company is also being pushed for change by activist investor Glenview Capital Management. Its CEO, Larry Robbins, one of four new members who have joined CVSs board, has said that the company should bring down debt.Medical CostsIn the insurance unit, CVS spent 94.8% of premium revenue on medical care in the quarter, less than analysts expected. Investors prefer a lower number. However, CVS said in a separate filing that high use of medical services will continue to pressure the business.The company pointed in particular to high costs in its business that manages care for patients on Medicaid, the US health program for the poor. States have been cutting Medicaid rolls since the pandemic, often culling healthier patients in the program while sicker patients remain.Revenue in all major divisions  insurance, drugstores and health services  were ahead Street expectations, as was overall quarterly revenue of $97.7 billion.Adjusted earnings for 2025 will be $5.75 to $6 a share, CVS said, while the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $6.

Companies like Alibaba have in recent weeks also released new iterations of their own AI models, and search engine firm Baidu said Friday that it would make its Ernie Bot AI chatbot available for free to public.With Beijing doubling down on AI as a national priority, investors are rushing to reprice Chinas tech and innovation potential.

        "content": "Wall Street analysts praised Astera Labs (ALAB) for its beat-and-raise fourth-quarter report but investors wanted more from the chipmaker. ALAB stock fell on Tuesday.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company late Monday reported adjusted earnings of 37 cents a share, up 208% year over year, on sales of $141.1 million, up 179%, in the December quarter.For the current quarter, Astera Labs expects adjusted earnings to rise 190% to 29 cents a share with sales increasing 134% to $153 million. That's based on the midpoint of its guidance.Despite beating Wall Street's targets with its Q4 results and outlook, ALAB stock retreated on Tuesday. In midday trades on the stock market today, ALAB stock was down more than 5% at 97.88.Analysts think investors were disappointed with the company's gross profit margins. Astera Labs posted a gross margin of 74.1% in Q4 vs. the Street target of 75%. For the March quarter, it expects a gross margin of 74% vs. the Street at 73.5%.\"We model gradually lower (gross margins) over the next several quarters and exiting at 71.5%+ by Q4 '26,\" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis said in a report.Also, the company's revenue growth is decelerating, he said.Lipacis maintained his outperform rating on ALAB stock and increased his price target to 123 from 110.All told, at least four Wall Street firms raised their price-targets on ALAB stock after the Q4 report.Astera Labs is benefiting from \"an expanding base of customers who are all accelerating their ramps/deployments\" of AI data centers, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur said in a client note. He reiterated his overweight, or buy, rating on ALAB stock and upped his price target to 130 from 110.Astera Labs makes semiconductor-based connectivity solutions for artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure.ALAB stock is on the IBD Tech Leaders list.Other semiconductor stocks moving on quarterly reports included GlobalFoundries (GFS) and Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC).Contract chipmaker GlobalFoundries edged above Wall Street's targets for the fourth quarter but undershot views with its current-quarter outlook. GlobalFoundries has posted seven consecutive quarters of declining earnings on a year-over-year basis as it navigates a cyclical decline in its semiconductor markets. Its revenue has declined for eight straight quarters.However, GFS stock rose 6.4% to 40.15 in midday trades on Tuesday.Lattice Semiconductor, a maker of low-power programmable chips, delivered largely in-line results for the fourth quarter with a slight raise to outlook for Q1. Lattice has now reported five straight quarters of declining sales and earnings on a year-over-year basis.But Lattice flagged early signs of a cyclical recovery in some end markets, such as automotive and communications.LSCC stock jumped 8.9% to 59.31 in midday trades on Tuesday.Follow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks."

        "source": "Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  U.S. stocks rallied to the brink of a record Thursday after more companies reported fatter profits than expected. Wall Street mostly yawned, again, at the latest announcement on tariffs  by President Donald Trump, which may not take full effect for at least several weeks.The S&P 500 climbed 1% to pull within 0.1% of its all-time high set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 342 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.5%.MGM Resorts International leaped to one of the markets biggest gains, 17.5%, after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It cited growth in China and said trends are looking up for its Las Vegas and North American digital businesses.Other companies reporting better profit than expected included GE HealthCare Technologies, which rose 8.8%, Molson Coors Beverage, which gained 9.5%, and Robinhood Markets, which jumped 14.1%.Such reports, along with a remarkably solid U.S. economy, have kept U.S. stocks near their records. A report on Thursday said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week,  the latest signal of a firm job market.Thats even though many downward forces are weighing on stock prices.Chief among them are worries about stubbornly high inflation. A report on Thursday said inflation at the wholesale level  was hotter than economists expected last month, following a similar report from the day before on inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.Tariffs could push up inflation even further. And Trump on Thursday rolled out his plan to increase U.S. tariffs on imports from other countries that will be customized, based in part on how much tax each country charges on U.S. goods.While economists warn about the pain such tariffs can create, financial markets have increasingly taken the threats in stride. Belief is strong that Trump is using tough talk to drive negotiations, but he may not fully go through with it in order to avoid damaging the U.S. stock market  and economy.It could take weeks or a few months to complete the necessary reviews for the tariffs announced on Thursday, according to a senior White House official who insisted on anonymity to preview the details on a call with reporters. That implies plenty of time for negotiations that could ease the ultimate impact.Of course, Wall Streets belief that the stock market is serving as a guardrail hemming in Trump may prove dangerous. If the stock market keeps gliding through each escalating threat, it could embolden Trump to make even bigger moves.But, for now at least, Trump may be boxed in a bit following the high inflation figures that have hit this week, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.Trump has already shown he can quickly pull back on threats, like when he put a 30-day pause on 25% tariffs he had announced for all imports from Canada and Mexico.Still, Trump followed through on a 10% tariff on Chinese products. GE HealthCare said Thursday it took those tariffs into account when it drew up its forecasts for profit and other financial measures in 2025.On Wall Street, Deere & Co. fell 2.2% after reporting drops in its revenue and profit for the latest quarter. The farm equipment manufacturer said it was focused on reducing inventory amidst the uncertain market conditions its customers were facing.Reddit, the online message board, dropped 5.3% even as it handily outdistanced Wall Streets fourth quarter sales and profit targets.Cisco Systems gained 2.1% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It cited strength for a wide range of its products, including for artificial-intelligence infrastructure.All told, the S&P 500 rose 63.10 points to 6,115.07. Its all-time high is 6,118.71, set on Jan. 23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 342.87 to 44,711.43, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 295.69 to 19,945.64.In the bond market, Treasury yields eased. While hotter-than-expected inflation data typically sends yields higher, economists saw some encouraging nuggets underneath the surface in Thursdays report. Easier health care services costs, for example, could end up helping to pull a different measure of inflation lower, one that the Federal Reserve considers a better measuring stick than the consumer price or producer price indexes.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.53% from 4.63%.Besides squeezing tighter on U.S. households budgets, stubbornly high inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve  on hold for a while when it comes to providing relief to Americans through lower interest rates.The Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply from September through the end of last year, intending to make borrowing cheaper, help the economy and boost prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. But the Fed warned at the end of 2024 it may not cut rates by as much in 2025 because of worries about inflation staying stubbornly high. Its goal is to keep inflation at 2%, and lower rates can give inflation more fuel.In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia.___AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

Its organic revenue growth of 13.8% also beat expectations.The company's shares were up 7.6% at 3,198 pence as of 1028 GMT.Earlier this week, Coca-Cola, which owns more than 20% of the bottler, gave a downbeat organic revenue growth forecast due to uncertainty fuelled by President Donald Trump's tariffs.While these tariffs have led to companies across sectors bracing for potential increases in costs, Coca-Cola HBC CEO Zoran Bogdanovic said any impact on commodity prices would be \"immaterial\" to the bottler.The company has also faced challenges in the Middle East due to consumer boycotts amid the Gaza conflict. However, Bogdanovic said that while the issue is not resolved, it has eased over the last few months.The Switzerland-based company expects core earnings to increase 7%-11% this year, compared with analysts' expectations of a 10.7% rise, according to company-compiled estimates.It also forecast organic revenue growth of 6%-8% for the year, compared to market expectations of 7.3%.Coca-Cola HBC said it expects moves such as adjusting package sizes to help counter the challenges of elevated inflation and currency fluctuations in markets such as Nigeria and Egypt.(Reporting by Raechel Thankam Job; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Savio D'Souza)"

The levies on Canada and Mexico have been paused for a month, but not on China.\"Our primary focus remains on understanding how proposed tariffs may impact our customers' operations as we recognize their need for free and fair trade and commodities,\" finance chief Joshua Jepsen said on a call with analysts.The company's shares, up about 11% this year through Wednesday's close, were last down 1.4% on Thursday.Meanwhile, prices of industrial metals, crucial for manufacturing equipment, are rising, driven by Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum amid insufficient domestic production.\"In terms of components or component sourcing, about 10% of our U.S. manufacturing cost of goods sold come from Mexico with less than 2% coming from China and approximately 1% from Canada,\" Jepsen said.The company said its forecast did not account for any potential impact from tariffs, citing the rapidly evolving nature of the policies currently.Deere reiterated its 2025 profit forecast of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, which many analysts had labeled conservative and were anticipating potential upward revisions as the year progressed.\"Even if the trade war abates at some point, farmers will likely navigate uncertainty with a great deal of caution around capex decisions,\" CFRA analyst Jonathan Sakraida said.The company now expects sales in its largest production and precision agriculture segment, which includes larger tractors and combines, to fall between 15% and 20%, compared to its previous forecast of a 15% decline.First-quarter net sales decreased 35% to $6.81 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $7.7 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Deere reported a profit of $3.19 per share, compared with Wall Street expectations of $3.11, helped by a drop in production costs.(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "It's no big secret that Warren Buffett has been a net seller of stocks recently. Thanks to several massive stock sales, and a few smaller ones, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) cash stockpile has ballooned to $325 billion as of the most recent quarter, far more than the conglomerate has ever had on hand before.However, this doesn't mean that Buffett and his team haven't been putting any money to work. In fact, there is one stock that Berkshire has been building a position in and recently added more. Now, Berkshire owns 35.4% of one industry-leading company in its massive stock portfolio.The company is satellite radio leader SiriusXM (NASDAQ: SIRI), which operates its own radio subscription service and owns the Pandora platform as well. As we'll see, there's a lot not to like about Sirius, but there are also plenty of reasons to like it from a risk-reward perspective.Sirius is down by about 50% over the past year, and to be fair, there are some good reasons for the move.For one thing, Sirius' revenue has been essentially flat for the past four years and is expected to decline in 2025. Plus, the company's subscriber base is about 5% smaller than it was when it peaked in 2019, and many investors think the company's best days could be in the past.On the other hand, there's a lot to like about Sirius. It essentially has a legal monopoly on the satellite radio industry, especially when it comes to new vehicle installations. As interest rates fall, it is likely to boost new car sales (financing gets easier and cheaper), and this is Sirius' bread-and-butter when it comes to attracting new subscribers. The company has rolled out several initiatives to boost its new car business, such as a three-year dealer-paid subscription program that is gaining serious traction.The company also has a lot of potential to unlock when it comes to advertising. Programmatic podcast ad revenue has been an especially strong growth area, and the company has launched a free ad-supported membership tier, a strategy which has worked well for other streaming content providers.In all, Sirius sees room to add 10 million new subscribers, which would easily exceed its 2019 peak, and to increase free cash flow from $1.15 billion (management's 2025 estimate) to $1.5 billion in 2027.Finally, SiriusXM is a cheap stock. It trades for about 8.5 times forward earnings estimates and is a highly profitable business that could be even more profitable in the future. Based on the growth projections discussed in the last section, SiriusXM trades for less than six times management's 2027 free cash flow target. Management is targeting $200 million in annual cost savings in 2025, in addition to the roughly $350 million it has already achieved in recent years, which should go a long way toward meeting that goal.Sirius XM has an excellent track record of capital return, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The stock currently yields about 4.1% and management has increased the quarterly dividend by more than 50% over the past three years. And there is a $1.166 billion stock buyback authorization in place, which will allow management to take advantage of weakness in the stock price.To be perfectly clear, we have no idea exactly why Berkshire Hathaway is scooping up so much Sirius XM stock, or if Warren Buffett himself has anything to do with the decision to keep buying more. While Buffett controls the bulk of Berkshire's investment capital, his two investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, manage billions of dollars independently and could be the ones pulling the trigger here.Whomever is making the investment in Berkshire's portfolio, it's easy to see why the stock could make sense to Buffett or one of his managers from a risk-reward perspective. To be sure, there's quite a bit of execution risk, but if SiriusXM can achieve its targets, the stock could be an incredible bargain at today's prices.Before you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Sirius XM wasnt one of them.

The stock jumped as much as 20% after the bell on Thursday, before giving back some gains.A social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen over the weekend sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor early Sunday morning. Saylor has famously hitched his company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, to bitcoin as it now holds more than 447,000 tokens. Strategy called itself \"the worlds first and largest bitcoin treasury company\" in its name-change announcement last week. Shares of Strategy are up roughly 370% over the past year as the company has continued buying bitcoin amid a nearly 100% rally in the cryptocurrency over the same time frame.As GameStop shares rose after Cohen's post, Sherwood's Luke Kawa noted that investors could be betting that GameStop will follow Strategy's bitcoin buying model.\"The warm market response to Cohens tweet suggests that traders are hoping that Cohen uses some of GameStops $4.6 billion in cash and cash-like securities to take a page from Saylors playbook. (That playbook has one rule: buy bitcoin),\" Kawa wrote.Back in December 2023, GameStop's board gave Cohen the authority to use the company's capital to make investments. That paved the way for the video game operator to use its cash like a holding company similar to the Daily Journal (DJCO) or Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A).Since hitting a high of $64 per share in May 2024 amid a meme stock revival, GameStop shares have slumped and are off about 15% in the past month.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Equinix forecast first-quarter and annual revenue below estimates on Wednesday, hurt by a strong dollar amid rising concerns about hefty spending on data center expansion as businesses double down on generative AI adoption.Shares of the company fell more than 2% in extended trading.Massive spending on AI and infrastructure investments has come under scrutiny this year after the launch of China's DeepSeek, which claimed to have developed AI models at a fraction of the cost compared to U.S. tech leaders OpenAI and Alphabet's Google.Equinix expects first-quarter revenue to be between $2.19 billion and $2.23 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $2.29 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.The forecast includes $25 million of higher seasonal costs and a $20 million negative foreign currency impact, when compared to the average exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company said.The company expects 2025 revenue to be between $9.03 billion and $9.13 billion, including a $252 million negative foreign currency impact when compared to the prior rates. Analysts estimated $9.40 billion.Equinix has a significant presence in Asia and Europe, making it susceptible to changes in foreign exchange rates.A strong dollar could hurt fourth-quarter revenue by as much as $31.5 million, TD Cowen analysts said in a note earlier in February.In the three months ended December 31, Equinix's revenue stood at $2.26 billion. Analysts expected $2.97 billion.Adjusted funds from operations, a key measure of cash flow, came in at $7.92 per share in the fourth quarter, missing estimates of $7.95 per share.(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)"

During the pilot, trading activity concentrated between 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. to 4 a.m.The shift toward 24-hour trading gained momentum after TD Ameritrade, now owned by Schwab, pioneered 24/5 trading in 2018 with approximately two dozen ETFs, according to the announcement.The Securities and Exchange Commission approved an application for 24X National Exchange to operate a U.S. stock exchange that trades between 4 a.m and 7 p.m. on weekdays and from 8 p.m. Sunday through 7 p.m. Friday, allowing nearly continuous trading throughout the week.Tesla Inc.

The new exchange-traded funds offer traders concentrated exposure to AMD's stock amid growing competition in the AI chip market, where the company aims to challenge Nvidia Corp.'s (NVDA) dominance.The new fundsthe Direxion Daily AMD Bull 2X Shares (AMUU) and Direxion Daily AMD Bear 1X Shares (AMDD)allow traders to take leveraged positions on AMD's daily performance, according to the announcement.\"AMD has a wealth of digital semiconductor expertise and is well-positioned to prosper from continued favorable trends in both artificial intelligence and data centers,\" said Direxion CEO Douglas Yones in the press release.The ETF provider's move follows AMD's strategic shift toward AI chip development, marked by a 4% reduction in its global workforce announced in November 2024, according to Reuters.The company's data center segment saw revenue more than double in the last quarter, according to company filings, though AMD's stock declined more than 5% in extended trading after the earnings announcement due to lower-than-expected data center sales.AMD CEO Lisa Su confirmed plans to launch next-generation RDNA 4 GPUs in early 2025, according to The Verge, highlighting the company's continued focus on gaming and graphics technology.The new AMD ETFs join Direxion's existing semiconductor single-stock funds, which track companies including Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Broadcom Inc.

(MU).Direxion emphasizes these products are meant for short-term trading rather than buy-and-hold investing, noting in filing documents that the funds involve \"a high degree of risk\" and are intended only for investors who actively monitor their positions.With 87 ETFs traded on US markets, Direxion ETFs have total assets under management of $40.3 billion, according to etf.com data.

In contrast, India is suffering a record exodus of cash on concerns over waning macro growth, slowing corporate earnings and expensive stock valuations.Chinas onshore and offshore equity markets have added more than $1.3 trillion in total value in just the past month amid such reallocations, while Indias market has shrunk by more than $720 billion. The MSCI China Index is on track to outperform its Indian counterpart for a third-straight month, the longest such streak in two years.DeepSeek has shown that China actually has companies that are forming a vital part of the whole AI ecosystem, said Ken Wong, an Asian equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments. His firm has been adding Chinese internet holdings over the past few months, while trimming smaller Indian stocks that had run up way past their valuation multiples.The rotation marks an about-face from the pivot into India seen over the past several years, luring funds away from China. That was based on an Indias infrastructure spending splurge and its potential as an alternative manufacturing hub to China. Domestic-focused India has also been seen as a relative haven amid Donald Trumps tariff plans.China looks to be regaining its former appeal on a fundamental reevaluation of its investability, especially in tech. After scaring investors with corporate crackdowns not long ago, Beijing may actually help push the new AI theme, as indicated by the news that entrepreneurs including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma have been invited to meet the nations top leaders.DeepSeek-related developments are likely to help boost Chinas economy as well as its markets, providing an extended boost, said Vivek Dhawan, a fund manager at Candriam. If you put all the pieces together, China becomes more attractive than India in the current set-up on a risk-reward basis.The valuation differential adds to Chinas allure as well. The MSCI China Index is trading at just 11 times forward earnings estimates, compared with about 21 times for the MSCI India Index.An analysis of Bloomberg data on regional allocations by some of the largest active Asian equity funds shows most are reducing exposure to Indian equities and adding Chinese stocks in recent months.While DeepSeek has helped accelerate the flows into China, possible upcoming announcements of further Chinese stimulus remain important as well, according to Andrew Swan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Man Group.We think policy will now shift toward consumption, and a targeted attempt to encourage the currently high levels of savings to be deployed, said Swan. The Man Asia Ex-Japan Equity fund he manages increased its China exposure to 40% from 30% in the past year while trimming its India exposure to 18% from 21%.A complete reversal in fund flows is unlikely, with India stock bulls including Morgan Stanley saying the recent correction may be overdone and the nations long-term growth story remains intact.Meanwhile, the additional 10% tariffs imposed on China by Trump have reinforced Amundi SAs neutral stance on Chinese equities, according to Asia senior investment strategist Aidan Yao. While a truce is possible as the two sides converge in trade talks, the external dynamics will remain fluid and challenging for China in the foreseeable future.Theres also skepticism among traders who have been burned by failed China rallies in the past. Some have pointed to crowded trading and increasing valuations as reason for caution.Helen Zhu, chief investment officer at Nan Fung Trinity HK Ltd., sees uncertainty over whether DeepSeeks AI success can be repeated. At the end of the day, you dont really know what the potential monetization opportunities are over the medium to longer term, she said.Nonetheless, theres a palpable buzz of Chinas back in the markets of late. The positives keep piling up, with Alibaba adding $100 billion in market value over the past five weeks and the Hang Seng Tech Index entering a bull market.The DeepSeek news was a well-timed and impactful catalyst that market participants were able to build a case for a reentry into Chinese markets, said Nicole Wong, a portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.

        "published": "2025-02-15T08:14:00Z",
        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Restaurants have notoriously low profit margins. But McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), the world's largest restaurant chain, is surprisingly one of the most profitable businesses. In fact, its profit margins are higher than prestigious businesses such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).I should clarify that profits can be measured from multiple angles. But one of the best ways to measure profits is with the operating margin. This metric excludes things that aren't related to regular business operations -- such as taxes, which can swing wildly from year to year -- and focuses only on the profits the business produces.On Feb. 10, McDonald's reported finalized financial results for 2024. During the year, the company had a stellar operating margin of 45%. That's among the very best in the world. And as the chart below shows, it's far better than the operating margin for companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Netflix.Assuming that the core business is burgers and fries, it would seem that McDonald's makes $45 in operating profit for every $100 it has in sales. This would suggest that its food is outrageously overpriced. But if you assume that selling food is the core business for McDonald's, you're wrong.McDonald's has operating margins as good or better than even the most profitable tech companies because it's not in the food business per se. And it's a really interesting thing for investors to note, as I'll explain.As of this writing, I'm still waiting on McDonald's to file its annual report, which contains more detailed financials than what it usually reports to investors. So allow me to mention some 2023 numbers for illustrative purposes. In 2023, McDonald's generated total revenue of $25.5 billion. Of this, it generated $15.4 billion (over 60% of its total revenue) from its franchised restaurants -- restaurants operated by independent third parties.The bulk of franchised revenue for McDonald's comes from a particularly surprising source. As it turns out, the company owns a lot of real estate that it rents out to its franchises. It generated $9.8 billion in rental income in 2023.McDonald's had over $27 billion in real estate at the end of 2023, when looking at land that it owned and buildings that were on land that it owned. This gives McDonald's the largest real estate portfolio of any restaurant company in the world. And this dynamic goes a long way to explaining why it has operating margins that are so high compared to other restaurant chains.In other words, McDonald's primarily offers third-party franchisees an opportunity to run a restaurant business. The company provides franchisees with the brand, the system, and even the building. The franchisees sell the classic burgers and fries, which is a much lower-margin business. But the parent company gets royalties and rental income, which is so high-margin that even software companies are jealous.McDonald's expects its operating margin to further improve in 2025. And even a modest improvement could still result in a large increase in operating profits given how massive the business is.Another interesting thing to consider is that McDonald's has around 43,000 restaurant locations today but expects to surpass 50,000 in 2027. That's a 16% increase in just three years, which is pretty meaningful for a business of this size. And since most of the growth will come from franchisees, expect a respectable increase in its high-margin revenue streams.Given how big and high-margin this business is, I consider McDonald's stock as one of the safest investments someone could make -- in other words, I believe there's a low chance of losing money over the long term. Given McDonald's size, I'd say it doesn't necessarily have the highest upside potential. But it could still be worth holding, and it's worth watching in case the price ever dips to a particularly attractive valuation.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Cisco Systems shares rose 6% on Thursday after the networking gear maker lifted its annual revenue forecast on strong AI-driven demand and reassured investors that U.S. tariffs would not have a big impact on its business.Demand for the telecom equipment maker's ethernet switches and routers used in data centers has surged as companies ramp up their investments in artificial-intelligence infrastructure.Triple-digit order growth from large-scale cloud companies and strong demand from telecom companies upgrading their networks has helped Cisco in an uncertain economic environment, J.P. Morgan analysts said.Cisco also moved to ease worries about the fallout from the tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. It expects \"negligible impact\" owing to its diversified global supply chain.However, it forecast a slight decline in gross margins in the third quarter, as the cost of the duties is built into it.After the pandemic wreaked havoc on its business, Cisco has been working to diversify its supply chain and reduce dependence on China for its electrical components.Still, a push by the Trump administration and billionaire Elon Musk to slash federal government budgets adds uncertainty for Cisco, a large supplier to the U.S. government.Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that the public sector makes up close to 20% of the company's overall revenue with the U.S. federal government making up less than 10% - of which 75% comes from the defense department.\"Cisco noted there was a resumption in the quarter of some of the paused business last quarter. However, we are not anticipating significant improvement in the near term as federal government conditions remain dynamic,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.Cisco was set to add nearly $15 billion to its market cap if gains hold.At least 10 analysts raised their price targets on the stock, according to data compiled by LSEG.Cisco has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.23, compared with Arista Networks 43.21.(Reporting by Kanchana Chakravarty, Siddarth S and Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

Venkatakrishnan told reporters the UK government was \"very, very committed to the growth agenda and how to prosecute it\".\"These things take time, and it takes many quarters to see the effects of it,\" he said. And so I am patient ... but patient with an expectation and confidence.\"Venkat last February laid out a three-year plan, which included cutting costs, returning billions of pounds in excess capital to shareholders and investing in its higher-returning UK business, which has helped to the bank's shares rise by more than 100% in the last 12 months.Barclays said it met its performance targets for 2024, including a return on tangible equity (RoTe) of 10.5% in line with guidance for greater than 10%. Return on equity is a key measure of profitability.\"Our new guidance for 2025, including Group RoTE of around 11%, represents an important next step in the journey towards our 2026 targets, including Group RoTE of greater than 12%,\" Venkat said in a statement.Analysts at Citi described the results as solid, but said there was not much new to excite shareholders either.\"...the strong run-up in the share price over the past year may temper any initial reaction, but the stock still appears inexpensive in our view,\" Citi said in a note to clients.Barclays reported pretax profit for the year to December 31 of 8.1 billion pounds ($10.12 billion), slightly above the 8.07 billion pounds average of analysts' forecasts and higher than the 6.6 billion pounds it reported for the year prior.The bank also extended the chairmanship of Nigel Higgins for another three years, as it looks to push ahead with its turnaround plan.INVESTMENT BANK BOUNCEThe group's investment bank generated just under half of the lender's 26.8 billion pounds of income in 2024, while its UK business and its U.S. consumer bank contributed 8.3 billion pounds and 3.3 billion pounds respectively.It set aside 90 million pounds to cover possible redress in light of the ongoing Financial Conduct Authority review into historical motor finance commission arrangements. Venkat also pledged an undetermined sum to compensate customers severely affected by recent IT outages.Barclays' total income in its investment bank reached 11.8 billion pounds, just above analysts' forecasts for 11.6 billion pounds, as dealmaking and trading activity increased.U.S. bank bosses have also expressed optimism for the year ahead, expecting that tax cuts and deregulation by President Donald Trump will energise businesses and capital markets as well as the economy.Revenue from Barclays' traditional powerhouse trading business of fixed income, currencies and commodities rose 29% to 934 million pounds in the final quarter of 2024, compared with an average of 29% among Wall Street's top five players, based on a Reuters calculation from earnings reports.Barclays' equities revenue rose 40% to 604 million pounds over the same period, outpacing the average 29% gain at its U.S. rivals Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.But for investment banking fees from M&A deals and fundraising, Barclays reported an 11% increase in income compared with a 35% average at its Wall Street rivals.\"Barclays is ... now beginning to deliver a reassuring level of consistency that it hadn't necessarily been known for in the past,\" RBC Brewin Dolphin investment manager Zoe Gillespie said, referring to the group as a whole.($1 = 0.8004 pounds)(Reporting by Chandini Monnappa in Bengaluru and Sinead Cruise in London, editing by Andres Gonzalez and Jane Merriman)"

But now DeepSeeks low-cost AI model is begging the question of whether such massive spending is even necessary.DeepSeek may spark a near-term market correction for SoftBank and other AI stocks, said Jung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management Global Pte. While the AI rally should pick up again longer term, the focus will be on monetization, he said, adding that will take years.Investment losses pushed SoftBank into the red for the latest quarter, and analysts forward earnings estimates are down around 25% from a late November peak. Bearishness has risen, with S&P Global Inc. data showing short interest in the shares at about 3.8% of the free float, near the highest level in 22 months.The Tokyo-listed stock got a boost when Son joined US President Donald Trump last month to unveil the Stargate Project with OpenAI and other partners. It then tumbled days later as Chinese startup DeepSeeks AI model shocked the world.Stargate has quite a few negative elements, and DeepSeek highlights that AI may not actually require so much datacenter power, said Kazuhiro Sasaki, head of research at Phillip Securities Japan Ltd. SoftBank will be shouldering a lot of the investment itself, and the interest on that debt is not insignificant.The financing burden for Stargate may also limit the stock buybacks that SoftBank has often relied on to support its share price, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note.Sell-side analysts are still mostly bullish on SoftBank, with the average price target projecting a gain of around 30% in the stock over the next year. Market observers cite the companys majority stake in AI darling Arm Holdings Plc as one major positive.SoftBank is equivalent to effectively investing in Arm but at a substantial discount, said Masakazu Takeda, a fund manager at Sparx Asia Investment Advisors Ltd. He notes Arm is also difficult to buy with so little of the stock in free float.Big gains in shares of Arm have have pushed its forward earnings-based multiple to over 80 times. The UK-based chipmaker got a boost Thursday after the Financial Times reported that it landed Meta Platforms Inc. as an early customer for a new chip.Excitement over Arm and Sons AI initiative had helped drive SoftBanks stock to a record high last July before a global tech selloff on valuation concerns. Still down some 20% from its peak, the prospects for recovery hinge on realizing profits from AI.Lofty investments in Stargate might hurt the companys profit in the short run, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Marvin Lo and Chris Muckensturm wrote in a note. Growing concerns around a potential change in AI economics amid the emergence of DeepSeeks low-cost, open-source large language models might cool the AI frenzy and thus cap SoftBank Vision Funds investment performance.Tech Chart of the DayIntel shares rose in premarket trading on Friday, putting the chipmakers stock on track for its biggest weekly gain since at least 1982.

        "content": "By Fabio TeixeiraRIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Chinese electric carmaker BYD acquired mineral rights for two plots of land in a lithium-rich part of Brazil in 2023, entering the mining business in its biggest market outside of China, according to public records reviewed by Reuters.The EV producer's acquisition of mineral rights in Brazil is its most concrete step so far toward mining strategic minerals in the Western Hemisphere.The previously unreported acquisition of the mineral rights in late 2023 was made by BYD subsidiary Exploracao Mineral do Brasil, which was created in May of that year, documents showed.The plots are just a half-day's drive from BYD's new factory project in northeast Brazil, which it also agreed to invest in 2023. They also neighbor plots owned by U.S.-listed miner Atlas Lithium.The subsidiary was created with a share capital of 4 million reais ($695,000) and turned a profit of about 213,000 reais from exchange rate variations in 2023, public registration documents showed.The company \"is in the research phase, with neither financial movement nor operating revenues,\" said a report from an October shareholders meeting seen by Reuters.BYD declined to comment on the matter.BYD, which bought stakes in major Chinese miners, was one of six firms allowed to bid on a Chilean lithium project last year, and outlined plans for a lithium cathode plant in northern Chile.Recent visits by U.S., Saudi and Chinese delegations have underscored global interest in Brazil as an open market in the geopolitical race for access to strategic minerals.Brazil has avoided a heavy state presence in its lithium sector, unlike its South American neighbors, even easing export controls on the metal in 2022.Its best lithium prospects are hard rock deposits that lend themselves to traditional mining, unlike tricky lithium extraction from salt flats in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.BYD's prospecting for Brazilian lithium reinforces the scale of its bet on Latin America's largest economy, where the firm's major investment in a former Ford factory complex was tarnished in December with accusations of labor abuses at the worksite.Last year, the Financial Times reported that BYD had talks with Sigma Lithium, Brazil's biggest lithium producer, over a possible supply agreement, joint venture or acquisition.LITHIUM VALLEYBYD's mineral rights cover 852 hectares (8.5 sq km) in the town of Coronel Murta, part of the Jequitinhonha Valley in the state of Minas Gerais known as Brazil's Lithium Valley.The neighboring Atlas Lithium project in Coronel Murta is in the research phase after an initial geological mapping of the area, the firm said on its website in June.Atlas CEO Marc Fogassa said he learned of BYD's presence through a third party, but never directly discussed it with the carmaker.\"If they invested in these two areas it is because they saw the potential and this obviously makes my areas more valuable,\" Fogassa told Reuters.Coronel Murta is around 825 km (512 miles) away, roughly a 12-hour drive, from the complex on the coast of Bahia state where BYD is developing the factory with capacity to make 150,000 electric cars per year.BYD has since it acquired the mineral rights, hired Minagem Geologia e Mineracao, a local mineral research firm, public documents show.Minagem said it would have to seek permission from the BYD subsidiary to speak about the matter.It can often take between eight and 15 years for a mining project in Brazil to start production if it is deemed economically viable, according to attorney Luiz Fernando Visconti of Visconti Law, a law firm specializing in the mining sector.($1 = 5.7568 reais)(Reporting by Fabio Teixeira in Rio de Janeiro, additional reporting by Luciana Novaes Magalhaes in Sao PauloEditing by Brad Haynes and Marguerita Choy)"

        "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying before the Senate on Tuesday, said \"policy restraint for longer\" is likely, if the labor market remains solid yet inflation doesn't keep falling toward 2%. That scenario is looking more likely as President Trump fires off a barrage of new or expanded tariffs, including those announced Monday on steel and aluminum that lifted Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).Trump tariffs have essentially supplanted Wednesday's consumer price index release as the big economic news of the week. Although core inflation could take a turn for the better in January data, economists expect that progress to be reversed by Trump tariffs in coming months.Powell's opening statement to the Senate in his semiannual monetary policy testimony highlighted the \"uncertainties\" the Fed faces as Trump rolls out an ambitious agenda of tax cuts, tariffs, deregulation and deportations. In a Dec. 18 news conference, Powell compared the Fed's job to \"driving on a foggy night.\" He added: \"You just slow down.\"Powell sees the Fed as being in a good position to do exactly that. With the January jobs report now in hand, Powell said that labor market conditions \"remain solid and appear to have stabilized.\" Powell noted an average of 189,000 monthly job gains over the past four months.With inflation still \"somewhat elevated\" and monetary policy \"significantly less restrictive than it had been,\" Powell said the Federal Reserve doesn't \"need to be in a hurry\" to cut again.The Fed's primary inflation rate, the core PCE price index, gets about 70% of its composition from the CPI and close to 30% from the producer price index. Deutsche Bank economists expect that the core PCE price index for January, which won't be released until Feb. 28, will ease to 2.6% from 2.8%. That's partly because the core PCE price index jumped 0.5% in January 2024, making for an easy year-over-year comparison.The core CPI rose a more moderate 0.4% in January 2024, which still presents room for improvement in Wednesday's figure. Economists see a 0.3% monthly increase, according to Econoday. That could see the 12-month core CPI inflation rate dip to 3.1% or hold steady at 3.2%.Thursday's PPI will include some important inputs into the core PCE price index, including its largest component, health care services prices.As Powell is likely to reiterate in his testimony, the impact of tariffs on inflation is far from certain. It can depend on currency fluctuations, substitution of goods by consumers, and decisions by wholesalers and retailers about how much of a price increase they will pass along.Deutsche Bank economists led by Justin Weidner wrote in a Monday note that Trump tariffs could push the Federal Reserve's main core inflation rate above 3.5% this year. That includes the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs, the delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico and Trump's new plan for \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The latter idea is a way for Trump to try and avoid tit-for-tat retaliation. It would have the U.S. match tariffs on goods imports from countries that have tariffs on imports from the U.S. Citing World Bank data, Deutsche Bank figures reciprocal tariffs could boost the average tariff rate on imports by 3.3 percentage points. The reciprocal tariffs, depending on how much was passed to customers, could boost inflation by 0.25 to 0.4 percentage point, they estimate.The steel and aluminum Trump tariffs might add a bit less than one-tenth of a percentage point to the inflation rate, Deutsche Bank figures, though the impact would be much higher on autos and appliances.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top StocksWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

        "source": "Reuters",
        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa(Reuters) -President Donald Trump's administration may not support Intel's U.S. chip factories being operated by a foreign entity, a White House official told Reuters.The comment was in response to a Bloomberg report that Taiwan's TSMC, the world's biggest chipmaker, was considering taking a controlling stake in Intel's factories at Trump's request.The White House official said the Trump administration supports foreign companies investing and building in the U.S. but is \"unlikely\" to support a foreign firm operating Intel's factories.Earlier, Bloomberg had reported that Trump's team raised the idea of a deal between the two firms in recent meetings with officials from TSMC, and that they were receptive, citing a person familiar with the matter.The White House official did not immediately comment on whether Trump's team met with the companies and raised the idea of such a deal. The official did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether TSMC could be involved with Intel's factories through a joint entity headquartered in the United States.Such a deal, which is still uncertain, could throw a financial lifeline to Intel, which has struggled to restore its lost chipmaking glory as it failed to capitalize on an AI boom and poured billions of dollars into becoming a contract chip manufacturer - a transformation that is yet to materialize.Intel shares closed down 2.2% on Friday, while TSMC's U.S.-listed shares closed up about 1%.It is unclear whether Intel is open to a transaction, according to Bloomberg, and the arrangement may involve having major American chip designers take equity stakes, along with support from the U.S. government. The report added that it meant the venture would not solely be owned by a foreign company.Earlier in the week research firm Baird published a note saying Intel's factories could be spun out into a new entity, jointly owned by Intel and TSMC, with TSMC's engineers helping ensure the factories are viable.\"Intel would benefit from significant cash flow relief, and would focus on design and platform solutions going forward, while a viable fab could finally attract key fabless companies to diversify into a geo-dependable manufacturing mode,\" Baird said in the note.Such a deal would need deep concessions on both sides.Should TSMC accept an arrangement to run Intel's factories, it would have to make significant changes to the U.S. chipmaker's operations because each chip manufacturer has distinct methods and techniques for operating factories.To operate Intel's fabs, TSMC would also likely need to reveal some of its proprietary techniques and processes to Intel employees.On its part, Intel would have to concede the fact that its manufacturing operations would become a totally different entity.As well, TSMC fully operating Intel's factories, known as fabs, also raises questions about Intel's key strategy of manufacturing the chips it has designed. Most chipmakers are \"fabless\" - outsourcing to the likes of TSMC, which offers considerable cost savings.\"If Intel moves down this path, you focus on being a semiconductor design company. So you end up looking more like a Broadcom or a Marvell or an AMD,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Matthew Bryson said.TSMC and Intel declined to comment.TARIFF EXEMPTIONS?Intel is among the largest beneficiaries of the United States' push to onshore critical chip manufacturing.Under the previous administration, the U.S. Commerce Department in November said it was finalizing a $7.86 billion government subsidy for Intel.The company is among a few chipmakers that both design and manufacture semiconductors. TSMC is now the world's largest contract chipmaker, which boasts a market valuation about eight times larger than that of Intel.The Taiwanese contract chipmaker's customers include AI chip leader Nvidia and AMD, which is Intel's fierce rival in PC and server markets.\"Ironically, enough, TSMC might look for some tariff exemptions in order to make this happen and allow for efficient and effective flow of equipment and materials,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.Trump tasked his economics team on Thursday to come up with plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports, ramping up prospects for a global trade war.Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted last year, set sky-high expectations for Intel's manufacturing and AI capabilities among major clients but fell short, losing or canceling contracts, Reuters had previously reported.Intel's shares lost about 60% of their value last year as the capital-intensive bid to bolster manufacturing - a strategy championed by Gelsinger - strained the company's cash flow and ultimately led to it cutting about 15% of its workforce.The success of Intel's 18A chipmaking technology, slated for this year, is key to the company's manufacturing ambitions.(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa, Akash Sriram and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru, Max A.

Last month, the Chinese startup DeepSeek released its latest AI model, R1, and shook up the world of the shakers.R1 has, reportedly, outperformed the best AI models on the American scene  but what makes this development truly important is how. The R1 model is open source, and DeepSeek has claimed that the AIs training cost  the combined cost of the background tech and hardware that makes it possible  came in at just $6 million. Thats a tiny fraction of the costs associated with some of the headline-grabbing US-based AI systems, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok.But is this a sign of a seismic shift in AI development, or just a one-off anomaly? Baird analyst Tristan Gerra leans toward the latter, suggesting this could be more of an exception than the start of a trend.DeepSeek is high in novelty claims but time will tell whether it creates a disruption in current AI models and AI architectures  we strongly suspect it does not. The claimed cost seems unrealistic, built on existing AI research and GPU architectures thus are not remotely comparable with the amount of AI costs already deployed without which DeepSeek would not exist. Additionally, we see lower-end/lower cost implementations as fueling further demand for AI systems, with price elasticity driving a commensurate surge in GPU volumes, Gerra opined.With that in mind, Gerra is doubling down on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) as top AI plays. Both companies are industry leaders, both enjoy Strong Buy analyst consensus ratings, and both stand to benefit from AIs relentless growth. Lets take a closer look.NvidiaFirst up on our list, Nvidia, isnt just the worlds largest semiconductor company  it is one of the largest publicly traded firms on Wall Street. The chip makers stock lost a historic $590 billion in the aftermath of the DeepSeek headlines, the biggest single-day decline ever recorded.However, Nvidias meteoric rise has been well-documented and even accounting for the recent DeepSeek-related loss, the stock has gained 441% over the past three years. The gains have come hand-in-hand with very strong sales, as Nvidias GPU chips have proven the most popular with data center operators and AI application developers.R1s release was a direct challenge to that dominance. According to DeepSeek, their latest AI model doesnt use the latest versions of the top-end processor chips or rely as much on high-speed computing. As a result, it makes only a fraction of the power demands we see in established AIs. If R1 lives up to this hype, it would become the first of a new model of AI, and Nvidia, which has based its success on dominating the market for expensive, high-end, AI-capable processor chips, will be forced to adapt quickly. That evidently spooked investors.Nvidia, for its part, seems to be taking this development in stride. The company released a statement praising DeepSeek for its impressive advancement in AI technology, especially in demonstrating the models test-time scaling capabilities. The company also noted that DeepSeeks R1 is still based on previous AI models  and those used more traditional AI training methods.Assuming Nvidia is correct, the market for high-end AI-capable chips is not going away  and Nvidia holds the leading position in that market, despite delays in the new Blackwell series. And last summer, Nvidia unveiled the successor to the Blackwell series, Rubin, a new GPU architecture scheduled for release in 2026.In its last set of financial results, covering fiscal 3Q25, Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenues, up 93% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $1.95 billion. At the bottom line, Nvidias non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents was 6 cents per share better than expected. The company finished the fiscal third quarter with $38.5 billion in cash and other liquid assets, providing the company with deep pockets to weather a storm.For Tristan Gerra, the key here is that Nvidia remains a solid player with a strong product line. The 5-star analyst says in his write-up on Nvidia, We are slightly lowering our 2H gross margin estimate for Nvidia given our expectation of a lower mix of GB200 versus B200/B300 this year based on system-level issues. Reducing our Grace unit estimate this year by 1M to 1.5M units to account for implementation challenges; this mix shift could reduce upside to our AI revenue estimate for the year. No changes to our EPS estimates: Beyond an expected B200 channel push, we expect strong B300 demand, while the Rubin platform should catalyze further performance/revenue growth. NVDA remains a Best Idea.As a Best Idea, Nvidia shares get an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating from Gerra, whose $195 price target on the stock implies a 49% increase from current levels over the next year. (To watch Gerras track record, click here)Overall, Nvidia shares hold a Strong Buy rating from the Streets analyst consensus, based on 39 recent reviews that include 37 to Buy and 3 to Hold. The shares are currently trading for $131.14 and have an average target price of $178.86, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 50%. (See NVDA stock forecast)Micron TechnologyNext on our list is Micron, a semiconductor chip firm based out of Boise, Idaho. The company is particularly well-known for its memory chips, essential components of the AI boom. Microns high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are especially suited to AI uses.In February of last year, Micron announced that it was partnering with Nvidia, providing its HBM3e chips for the larger firm to use in its AI-capable semiconductors. More recently, Microns HBM4 was chosen for use in Nvidias upcoming Rubin platform. Micron boasts that its HBM chips can match or exceed the performance of its rivals while consuming 30% less power, giving them a competitive advantage in a tough field.Like Nvidia above, Micron took a hard hit with the release of DeepSeeks R1. Micron, like most of its peers, has benefited greatly from the rise in AI over the past few years. But, by stepping up and providing the powerful memory chips required by AI data centers and high-speed computing, the company is vulnerable to DeepSeeks release of a lower-cost, less energy-hungry AI competitor. The chips consume less power but keep their performance: the chief qualities that will be needed to compete with DeepSeeks model.Like Nvidia above, Micron comes to this fight with a record of successes. The companys earnings and revenues have both been trending upwards in recent quarters. In the last reported period, fiscal 1Q25, Microns $8.71 billion in revenue was up 84% year-over-year and met Street expectations, while the non-GAAP EPS of $1.79 beat the forecast by 2 cents. Micron had $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal first quarter.Checking in again with Baird analyst Gerra, we find him upbeat on Micron  citing the companys exposure to Nvidias Rubin as a key point. Gerra says of Micron, We are bullish on the ramp of Rubin, which by extension will be very positive for HBM content. The larger die size and I/O count of Rubin means a 30%+ increase in HBM capacity required to support flat volume. This dynamic is in support of continued tight HBM supply in 2026 and will benefit pricing/margin, in our view. Micron is well entrenched as a key HBM supplier starting in 2H25 while Samsung continues to struggle. Lower Grace volumes is a positive for DDR5. Micron remains a Best Idea.Looking ahead, the analyst gives MU shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, with a price target of $130 that points toward an upside of 42% for the next 12 months.The Strong Buy consensus rating on Micron is based on 23 recent reviews that break down to 21 Buys and 2 Holds. The shares are priced at $91.68, and their $136.1 average price target is a bit more bullish than the Baird view, suggesting a one-year upside of 48%.

        "content": "Big Techs 2025 is off to a rough start. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) missed Wall Streets expectations on cloud revenue in their latest quarters; Apple (AAPL) fell short on iPhone sales; and Tesla (TSLA) disappointed on the top and bottom lines.And that's weighing on the companies stock prices. Google and Microsoft are down 2.7% and 2.9% year to date, respectively, while Tesla is off 17%. Apple's stock has declined over 5%. Amazon is up 4.3% during the same period, but, as of Wednesday, is off 1.4% since it reported its earnings on Feb. 7.But one company is thriving: Meta (META).The social media giants stock is up 24% since the start of the year and, as of Wednesday, is riding a 17-session winning streak on Wall Street. Why is Meta performing so well when other hyperscalers are falling?Its certainly not because its rivals are plowing money into AI investments. Sure, Amazon said it plans on capital expenditures north of $100 billion in 2025, and Google and Microsoft will shell out $75 billion and $80 billion, respectively. But Meta also plans to splash huge sums on the technology, saying itll pour between $60 billion and $65 billion into capital expenditures this year.It's simpler than that. While its Big Tech rivals are spending to draw outside customers, Meta's spending will power its own growth.I think Meta may actually be the most consequential company of our time right now, and I think it's because they are the ultimate customer zero, Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman explained. Nothing they are doing as a hyperscaler is merely for the sake of reselling to others.Part of the reason Metas AI investments are paying off on Wall Street is because the spending directly benefits the companys ad sales and the time users spend on its platforms.They've used [their AI investments] largely to drive their business where ... other companies have been trying to be a little bit more all things to all people, explained Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research.The benefit to Metas approach is clear in its early results. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, artificial intelligence is impacting virtually all of the companys work.Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone, Zuckerberg explained during the companys Q3 earnings call in October.And during Metas Q4 call, CFO Susan Li said 4 million advertisers are using the companys generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. All of that makes AI an easier sell for investors.Meta is just so much more straightforward, explained Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.Thats not to say that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft arent seeing positive traction thanks to their AI investments. But rather, the path from laying out the capital to build data centers to customers signing up for their AI platforms isnt as clear-cut as Metas.[Hyperscalers have] all talked about services leveraging AI that they're offering on their own, TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob ODonnell explained. I just think that Meta doesn't have the distraction of selling their ... [computing] services.The possibilities of Metas open-source Llama AI models are also attracting Wall Street as the company seeks to build out a global AI standard. While Meta currently offers the software for free, there are a handful of limitations on how users can take advantage of it, including a limit of 700 million monthly users accessing a service using Llama.You could definitely see how all these companies that are going to use Llama as a base model that could, through licensing, become a really big revenue stream in the future, Newman said.And Zuckerberg is keen on ensuring Llama 4, the companys next-generation open-source model, leads the industry.Llama 4 will be natively multimodal  it's an omni-model  and it will have agentic capabilities, so it's going to be novel and its going to unlock a lot of new use cases, he said during the companys Q4 earnings call. I'm looking forward to sharing more of our plan for the year on that over the next couple of months.How Meta ends up successfully monetizing Llama is still up in the air. And its still incredibly early in the AI race to declare any winners just yet. But for now, investors are clearly impressed with what Zuckerberg and his company have put together so far.Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "Obtaining approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a key medication can be a huge catalyst for a healthcare stock. It opens up new growth opportunities for the business. And investors become more bullish about its long-term prospects, and the potential the stock has to rise higher in value.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) has many promising treatments in its pipeline, as it looks to build out its business beyond just the cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs that have enabled it to post strong profits and provide investors with stability. But it's growing that portfolio of drugs which will lure in growth investors. And with a recent approval, the company can now add to its list of approved drugs.On Jan. 30, the FDA granted approval for Vertex's pain medication, Journavx. It's a non-opioid treatment for moderate to severe acute pain. For the healthcare industry, this can be a valuable medication, as it gives patients an alternative to highly addictive opioids. In 2023, more than 81,000 people died from overdoses involving opioids, a number that was actually lower than the 84,000 who died the year before, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics. It's a serious problem in the U.S., and Journavx can play a key role in helping to bring these numbers down.Analysts see huge potential for Journavx to become a blockbuster drug that could generate peak annual revenue of around $5 billion by 2031. For Vertex, this opens up an exciting new growth opportunity for the business, and it adds to an already strong portfolio of CF drugs.Vertex has a solid business, but growth investors may be looking for much better numbers. The company recently released its latest earnings report, for the last quarter of 2024 as well as the entire year. In 2024, Vertex's product revenue totaled $11 billion and rose by 12% year over year. This year, it's projecting sales of around $12 billion as it expects \"early contributions\" from Journavx. As the company rolls out the new drug, that could help boost sales and lead to an acceleration of its growth in future years.And Vertex still has more treatments in its pipeline, including medications aimed at treating type 1 diabetes, IgA nephropathy, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, and other conditions. Its growth rate may not look all that exciting today, but in the long run, the business has a lot of room to grow its sales and profits significantly.Vertex's double-digit growth rate is solid and its future remains bright, giving investors a lot of incentive to just hang on to the stock for the long term. Shares are also trading at 25 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst expectations), which isn't a terribly high multiple given the company's promising growth potential.Year to date, shares of Vertex are up around 15%, and there could still be much more upside down the road. While the share price isn't taking off just yet, as analysts raise their price targets based on its heightened growth potential and the company gets more attention, it may only be a matter of time before investors start to see the fantastic investment opportunity that the stock represents. Buying shares before that happens could be a great move to make today.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Meta's big robotics play could wind up being a significant performance driver for the memory specialist.Bloomberg published a report today stating that Meta plans to make a big play in the humanoid-robot space. Nvidia uses Micron's memory chips as components in its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.Nvidia's advanced GPUs are the key hardware powering bleeding-edge AI software.

        "content": "For more than two years, Wall Street has been a stomping ground for the bulls. Since the curtain opened for 2023, the mature stock-powered Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have respectively rocketed higher by 34%, 58%, and 88%.Investors haven't had to dig too deeply for catalysts behind this rally. In no particular order, the current bull market owes its thanks to:The rise of artificial intelligence (AI).A resilient U.S. economy.Better-than-expected corporate earnings.A decline in the prevailing rate of inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1%.Excitement surrounding stock splits.Donald Trump's return to the White House.But as Wall Street has reminded investors for more than a century, when things seem too good to be true, they usually are.Though the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all recently hit fresh all-time highs, one time-tested valuation tool, which was once endorsed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is also in uncharted territory -- but not in a good way.There is no one-size-fits-all definition when it comes to \"value.\" What one investor considers to be expensive might be viewed as a bargain by another. Nevertheless, there are a handful of tried-and-true valuation tools that investors have relied on over the years to determine whether a stock, or the broader market, is relatively cheap, pricey, or somewhere in between.Most investors are probably familiar with the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which divides a company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share. This quick valuation measure tends to work wonders on mature businesses, but it's not particularly useful for growth stocks or during periods of economic turbulence.A far better measure of value on Wall Street, according to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) \"Oracle of Omaha,\" is what's now known as the \"Buffett Indicator.\" The Buffett Indicator divides the total market cap of all U.S.-traded stocks into U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).In an interview with Fortune magazine in 2001, Berkshire's chief referred to the market-cap-to-GDP ratio as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"When back-tested to 1970, the Buffett Indicator has averaged a reading of 85%. This is to say the total market cap of all U.S. stocks has averaged 0.85 times as much as U.S. GDP over the last 55 years.But as you'll note in the post above from Barchart on social media platform X, the Buffett Indicator is well above its historic norm. Updated for the latest round of U.S. GDP data (which isn't reflected in Barchart's post from Dec. 9), this once-touted valuation measure of Buffett's hit an all-time high of 207.04% on Jan. 22, which is more than 140% above its 55-year mean.Previous instances of the Buffett Indicator blasting to new highs have portended significant downside for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. For instance, this valuation tool had previously peaked at 195.62% on Nov. 7, 2021, which is just two months before the 2022 bear market kicked off and sent all three indexes lower by more than 20%. Prior to this, the Buffett Indicator topped out at 166.56% on Feb. 18, 2020, just prior to the COVID-19 crash.In other words, history has shown that when Buffett's prized valuation tool moves well beyond the bounds of its long-term average, trouble follows for Wall Street. This may be why the Oracle of Omaha has been a net seller of stocks for eight consecutive quarters at Berkshire Hathaway, to the tune of $166.2 billion.To be fair, the Buffett Indicator is far from the only ominous metric or data point at the moment. For instance, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio is at its third-highest reading dating back 154 years, and U.S. M2 money supply declined in 2023 by a level not witnessed since the Great Depression.Nevertheless, Warren Buffett regularly reminds investors not to bet against America -- and history suggests you heed that advice.The reason the Oracle of Omaha is a long-term investor is simple: he recognizes the nonlinearity of economic and investing cycles.For example, Buffett and his top advisors at Berkshire Hathaway are fully aware that recessions are a normal and inevitable aspect of the economic cycle. But rather than try to guess when these downturns will occur, he and his team wisely play the numbers game. Whereas the average recession since the end of World War II has lasted roughly 10 months, the typical economic expansion has endured for around five years. Wagering on the U.S. economy to expand has been, and should remain, a winning bet.The same can be said for putting your money to work on Wall Street.In June 2023, shortly after the S&P 500 was confirmed to be in a new bull market, the researchers at Bespoke Investment Group published a data set on X that compared the length of 27 separate bull and bear markets in the benchmark index dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929.Spanning 27 downturns where the S&P 500 shed at least 20% of its value, the average bear market endured only 286 calendar days, or roughly 9.5 months. In comparison, the typical bull market for this widely followed index stuck around for 1,011 calendar days over 94 years, which is 3.5 times longer than the average bear market.It's also worth pointing out that if the current bull market in Bespoke's data set were extrapolated to present day, more than half (14 out of 27) of all bull markets have lasted longer than the lengthiest bear market, which was 630 calendar days in the mid-1970s.Even if valuation tools accurately portend trouble to come for the stock market, the numbers game strongly favors investors who, like Warren Buffett, think long term.Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and S&P 500 Index wasnt one of them.

Shares of Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) initially moved sharply skyward after the company posted encouraging financial results on Thursday afternoon following the market's closing bell.Roku was already turning heads before this week's blowout fourth-quarter performance. The shares had nearly doubled since bottoming out this past summer. The strong results are kicking things up a notch higher, so let's take a closer look at some of the reasons the Roku story is getting even better.The top line is always a good place to start. Net revenue for the final three months of 2024 topped $1.2 billion, just ahead of both the $1.15 billion analysts were targeting and the $1.14 billion Roku was modeling back in October. The record revenue is a 22% increase, the strongest year-over-year percentage jump for Roku since early 2022. Platform revenue topped $1 billion for the first time.The bottom line brought an even bigger beat. Its net loss narrowed to $0.24 a share, a lot less red ink than the $0.43 Wall Street pros were expecting. Roku came through with large bottom-line beats in every quarter in 2024. Deficits aren't fun, but Roku keeps clawing its way back to return to profitability.There are now 89.8 million streaming households on the Roku platform, a net gain of 12%, or 9.8 million homes, from where it was at the start of last year. An important milestone was reached, as Roku now has a presence in more than half of the country's broadband households. Roku competes against some of the wealthiest companies in the planet, and it's gobbling market share at their expense.This isn't a passive audience that Roku is reaching. These homes spent 127.1 billion hours streaming through Roku during the fourth quarter, an 18% jump over the prior year's holiday quarter. Streaming hours keep growing faster than the number of households on the platform, and that's a good thing. It means the average viewer is spending more time cradling the Roku remote.When the streaming services pioneer launched The Roku Channel, it was easy to wonder if the platform operator was flying too close to the sun. One thing that sets Roku apart from other streaming hubs is its agnosticism. It plays nice with most apps, giving viewers thousands of options without being perceived as trying to steer folks to its own premium offerings.The Roku Channel is a free ad-supported channel. Roku has made shrewd grabs for content that it can serve up to generate ad revenue while also making its platform more engaging. And that approach is working, as The Roku Channel became one of the five most popular channels on its hubs earlier in 2024. It's still a speedster. Streaming hours have increased 82% over the past year, and it now reaches households with roughly 145 million people.The report wasn't perfect. Roku's net and operating loss widened sequentially in the fourth quarter. Expenses are inching higher at a faster pace than its improving business. However, Roku's guidance and a new target for next year should woo investors who had sworn off Roku for its lack of profitability.Roku's guidance call for a net loss of $40 million in the current quarter. This would be another slight sequential deterioration from the nearly $36 million net loss it just clocked in with for the fourth quarter. But zoom out. Roku also sees a net loss of $40 million for all of 2025. In other words, Roku expects to break even through the final nine months of this year. It's also now telling investors it should achieve positive operating income for all of 2026.As a free operating system to get TV homes connected, Roku's business is driven primarily by how well it can monetize its audience. Even over the seasonally potent holiday quarter in which Roku sticks and other hardware sell briskly, devices accounted for just 14% of the revenue mix.Roku's platform revenue is responsible for the lion's share of the business, and that means things like advertising revenue and collecting fees when folks sign up for premium services through its hub. Roku was going through a crisis until just recently, when average revenue per user or ARPU was stagnant if not declining despite the platform's growing engagement levels.Roku generated $41.49 in ARPU during the fourth quarter, a figure that adds up the average revenue per user over the trailing 12 months. That's a 4% increase from where Roku was a year ago, rising sequentially for four straight quarterly reports. A 4% increase may not seem like a lot, but it's the first time in two years that the figure was materially positive. Roku is on the right track, and there's no denying now that momentum is firmly on its side.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "By Allison Lampert(Reuters) - Air Lease Corp's CEO said on Thursday he expected lease rates and aircraft valuations to rise on a shortfall of commercial planes, after the company reported lower quarterly revenue primarily due to a decline in end-of-lease revenue.Aircraft lessors are benefiting from high rental revenue as airlines look for aircraft that are in short supply due to supply chain problems, along with lower production levels of Boeing's 737 MAX and engine snags.But lessors and airlines are still wrestling with delivery delays from planemakers Boeing and Airbus. Air Lease expects to receive airplanes worth $3 billion to $3.5 billion in 2025, with 80% coming from Boeing.Air Lease also expects to sign new leases at higher rates as lower-yielding leases agreed when the market was weak during the COVID-19 pandemic expire.Air Lease CEO John Plueger said he expected $5 billion of leases from that period to roll off over the next two years.Plueger also told analysts that demand for twin-aisle wide-body jets has surged faster than demand for single-aisle planes over the past six months, reversing a post-pandemic trend.Air Lease Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said demand for larger planes was underpinned by passenger demand for international travel, an aging fleet and shortfall in supply as Boeing and Airbus wrestle with production challenges on their 787 and A350 models.It's \"developing into what we expect to be a protracted shortfall of good, widebody aircraft over multiple years to come,\" Udvar-Hazy said.Given sustained demand for large commercial jets, Udvar-Hazy said he saw room for a third player in the market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus, although any new aircraft would need engines that had significantly improved reliability.\"But I think that third party - and the one that's talked about most is (Brazil's) Embraer - would need a partner in that program that has financial deep pockets,\" he said.In its financial report, Air Lease said its revenue in the fourth quarter fell 3.7% to $712.9 million and net income declined to $93 million from $211 million in the same period of 2023, as it also made higher interest payments on funds borrowed to finance aircraft purchases.But for the full year, the California-based lessor generated record annual revenues, helped by the company's $5 billion in aircraft purchases from its orderbook, and $1.7 billion in aircraft sales, it said.(Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Jamie Freed)"

Half of this impact will be seen in the second quarter, financial chief Brice Hill said on the call.This represents about 1.4% of the $29.18 billion analysts expect Applied to record in fiscal 2025 revenue, according to data compiled by LSEG.The U.S. government said in December that new controls will be placed on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment needed to produce advanced-node chips to China.\"The ability of U.S. companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules,\" CEO Dickerson said.Applied Materials forecast second-quarter revenue of about $7.1 billion, plus or minus $400 million, compared with the estimates of $7.21 billionHalf of the impact from trade restrictions to 2025 revenue is expected in the services segment, under which the company provides upkeep and optimization for machinery, the executives said, as the company is unable to address some customers in China.Sales to China accounted for about 31% of Applied Materials' total first-quarter sales, down from about 45% of total revenue in the year-ago period.Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump also tasked his economics team with devising a plan to impose reciprocal tariffs on every country that imposes duties on U.S. imports, targeting China, Japan and South Korea  some of Applied's largest markets.This has offset the positive impact of a rise in demand for advanced chips capable of processing the vast data employed by generative AI.Applied expects second-quarter adjusted profit of $2.30 per share, plus or minus 18 cents, in line with estimates of $2.30 per share.The company reported first-quarter revenue of $7.17 billion, beating estimates.(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)"

The measure exempted shipments of less than $800 from import duties.Last week, Reuters reported that Shein was set to cut its valuation in a potential listing to around $50 billion, nearly a quarter less than the company's fundraising value of $66 billion in 2023, amid growing headwinds.(Reporting by Shivani Tanna in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonia Cheema)"

The owner of Bobbi Brown and La Mer attributed the setback to \"subdued consumer sentiment\" across China and South Korea, as well as challenges in its Asia travel retail business.Shortly after reporting its results the company said it would slash 5,800 to 7,000 jobs worldwide with the goal of \"managing external volatility, such as potential tariff increases globally\".Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: WEIBO/ Mao Geping>While tariff risks loom, foreign businesses face a more immediate challenge: slowing growth and declining sales as local competitors gain favour and an economic downturn constrains spending by China's enormous middle class, which has traditionally favoured imported brands.\"Historically, MNCs led the premium segment, supported by the perception that foreign brands were superior, aspirational and symbolised trendiness and quality,\" consultant Bain & Company said in a report on Tuesday. \"However, in recent years, that 'halo effect' has waned and local brands have substantially increased their quality and competitiveness.\"In addition to Estee Lauder, French skincare giant L'Oreal and Japan's Shiseido have also suffered while the pingti trend - a preference for cheaper but high-quality local alternatives - benefits domestic brands like Mao Geping, analysts said.Meanwhile, in the luxury fashion sector, Christian Dior parent LVMH, Gucci parent Kering and Burberry have been battered by tepid demand in China. During an earnings call on Tuesday, Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault told analysts that he did not expect the country's \"economic crisis\" and low consumer confidence to improve this year.\"For luxury goods, the issue isn't Chinese brands replacing international ones - because China doesn't have [major] luxury brands - but rather the decline of the overall market and shrinking spending power,\" said SPDB's Lin.All is not lost for MNCs. US-based Ralph Lauren reported 20 per cent sales growth in the third quarter from a year earlier, thanks to fondness for its \"old money aesthetic\" on social-media platforms like RedNote. Coach parent Tapestry eked out 2 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in the most recent three-month period, as the US-based firm's products resonated with China's luxury-loving but increasingly budget-conscious middle-class consumers.\"For premium brands, success hinges on how well MNCs tailor their brand positioning for locals, embed higher-level values into their products and bring those values to life,\" Bain's report said. For mass-market brands, unbundling the value chain and developing local partners could help drive cost-competitiveness, it added.\"Chinese consumers today are highly sophisticated,\" said Ivan Su, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. \"They don't buy a product simply because it's from a Chinese or international brand. [They] now have distinctive tastes and trends, and expect brands to cater to them with more focus and dedication.\"This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

A BP spokesperson declined to comment further.Elliott's move on BP has boosted its shares, signalling that investors are optimistic that the activist might press for changes that deliver returns.BP CEO Murray Auchincloss is on a mission to revitalise the company and boost profits but since taking on the job last year he has faced an uphill battle to reverse the company's underperformance.On Tuesday he pledged to fundamentally reset the company's strategy as it reported a 35% fall in annual profits, missing analysts' expectations.Elliott started investing in BP last year, the person said.The activist investor is not asking the British oil major to move its listing to the U.S., the source said, adding that rival Shell has been delivering in the UK and outperforming.With a market value of about 75 billion pounds ($93.86 billion), based on LSEG data, BP is currently worth less than half of Shell.Elliott's campaign is being led by Gaurav Toshniwal and John Pike, the person said.They both have experience in energy investments. Pike is also currently running Elliott's U.S. refiner Phillips 66 campaign and was involved in the campaign against oil company Hess in 2017.Financial Times first reported that Elliott had built a BP stake of about 3.8 billion pounds, making it the oil company's third-largest shareholder.BlackRock and Vanguard hold larger stakes in the energy major, at 9% and 5% respectively, the FT report said.Elliott Management, which has about $70 billion in assets, is due to publish a regulatory filing in the U.S. on Friday to disclose its quarterly positions in listed companies.($1 = 0.7991 pounds)(Reporting by Arunima Kumar and Yamini Kalia in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Jane Merriman)"

Tesla has been the laggard of the group, falling 11.9% in 2025.With a close at a record high of $736.67 on Friday, Meta stock is now up over 600% from its lows hit back in the fall of 2022.Amid that year's tech washout that followed the Federal Reserve's decision to begin raising interest rates aggressively in the face of a 40-year high in inflation, Meta stock fell more than 70% from peak to trough.Wall Street widely cheered the results following the company's latest earnings report.As its Big Tech peers have announced ambitious investment plans toward AI this year, Meta's spending announcement received the most positive reception. And news this week that the company began widespread layoffs across teams only adds to investors' optimism that its plans to invest up to $65 billion this year toward AI will be amid increased efficiency across its teams.\"The integration of AI-enabled features and products within their Family of Apps is helping drive more activity on their platforms with greater ad engagement,\" wrote D.A.

        "content": "By Byron Kaye and Sherin Sunny(Reuters) - Penfolds wine producer Treasury Wine Estates pulled the sale of its cheap drinks division after failing to find an attractive offer and cut its prediction for annual profit, sending its shares tumbling.The division's weak results and outlook soured an otherwise upbeat first-half result for Australia-listed Treasury as exports to China roared back to life after the end to three years of crippling tariffs imposed by Beijing.Treasury had planned to offload budget labels including Wolf Bass and Lindeman's last year amid a global trend of young drinkers turning away from alcohol. But \"the offers received for these brands did not represent compelling value and therefore their retention is the best course\", it said on Thursday.Net profit excluding one-off items jumped 33% to A$239.6 million ($150 million) in the six months to end-December, just short of the average analyst forecast from data aggregator Visible Alpha.That owed much to the first full reporting period of exports to China since 2020 and the contribution of recently-bought U.S. winery business DAOU.But pre-tax profit from its \"premium brands\" unit, which includes its cheaper wine labels, halved, partly \"reflecting softness in consumer demand for wine at lower price points\".Citing reduced expectations for the unit, the company now expects pre-tax profit of about A$780 million for the financial year ending in June. That compares with an earlier estimate of A$780 million to A$810 million.Treasury shares lost 4% by midsession, having fallen as much as 8% at one point as analysts downgraded their forecasts in line with the new guidance. The overall market was flat.\"With the company deciding not to sell its commercial portfolio, (the premium brands business) might be a drag on group earnings for some time,\" Citi said in a note.UBS said the guidance downgrade was \"disappointing but somewhat reflected in share price\". The stock is down 4% compared to a year ago while the broader market has gained 12%.Treasury declared an interim dividend of 20 Australian cents per share, compared with 17 Australian cents last year.($1 = 1.5929 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney, Sherin Sunny and John Biju in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Edwina Gibbs)"

However, they had still managed to perform better than analysts' expectations.PBF Energy said its consolidated gross refining margin was a loss of $3.89 per barrel in the fourth quarter, compared with $1.04 per barrel it earned a year earlier.\"Global refining markets remain structurally tight, and capacity rationalization and demand growth are expected to exceed new refinery additions,\" PBF Energy's CEO Matt Lucey said.The company said its crude oil and feedstocks throughput in the reported quarter fell to 862,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), from 878,200 bpd a year earlier.PBF Energy also said the scope and timing of a planned turnaround activity at Martinez refinery in California may be impacted after a fire occurred at the location on February 1.\"At this time, the cost of repairs and the length of the shutdown arising from the incident cannot be reasonably estimated,\" the company said.On an adjusted basis, the company lost $2.82 per share in the fourth quarter, compared with estimates of a loss of $2.81 according to data compiled by LSEG.(Reporting by Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)"

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Technology stocks have helped lead the market higher over the past couple of years. While many of these tech stocks have run up in value (and in valuation), there are still some stocks that remain attractively priced when considering their future potential for growth.Let's look at two bargain tech stocks in particular that appear to be ready for (or to maintain) a bull run.Despite the stock's incredible performance over the past several years, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock remains attractively valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 24 times 2025 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.5 (PEG ratios of below 1 considered undervalued).The company is the market share leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) with an approximate 90% market share. GPUs, meanwhile, have become the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure due to their superior processing speeds that are needed to train large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference.Nvidia created a wide moat in the GPU space with the help of its CUDA software platform, which it developed many years ago to allow customers to program its chips for applications beyond their original purpose of speeding up graphics rendering in video games. This led to developers learning to program GPUs using CUDA, making it the industry standard.Meanwhile, in the years since, the company has expanded its software edge through CUDA X, which includes a collection of microservices, libraries, tools, and technologies designed for AI and high-performance computing.While rival Advanced Micro Devices also designs GPUs, it is a distant second, largely due to Nvidia's superior software platform. In a detailed test, independent semiconductor research company SemiAnalysis said that AMD's GPUs were \"not usable\" for AI training out of the box and that it needed considerable help from the company to patch software bugs. Meanwhile, it said Nvidia continues to widen its CUDA moat with \"new features, libraries, and performance updates.\"As such, Nvidia remains the best-positioned company to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending, which is set to continue to soar this year. The big three cloud computing companies -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- have announced over $250 billion in planned capital expenditures (capex) combined in 2025, largely on AI infrastructure, while Meta Platforms will spend an additional $60 billion to $65 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon said that any reduction in inference per unit costs would likely just lead to more overall AI infrastructure spending.With AI infrastructure spending continuing to ramp up and the stock trading at an attractive valuation, Nvidia looks poised for a bull run.While DeepSeek brought a spotlight to China's progress in AI, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is one of the big leaders in the AI space among Chinese companies. Meanwhile, the stock is very cheap, trading at a forward P/E of only 11.5 times 2025 analyst estimates and a PEG ratio under 0.3. Alibaba also has around $50 billion in net cash on its balance sheet as well, which is nearly 20% of its market cap.Late last month, Alibaba introduced its latest Qwen 2.5-Max LLM, which it says not only outperforms DeepSeek across the board, but also models from OpenAI and Meta Platforms. Alibaba, meanwhile, has been at the forefront of offering open-source AI models for very specific purposes, such as language, audio, vision, coding, and mathematics based off its foundational Qwen model.Alibaba was praised by Citron Research, a research company known more for short-selling, which said Alibaba's Qwen models have been ahead of the curve for the past six months. It added that Qwen's enterprise applications will help China catch up in business software, an area where the country has greatly trailed the West.Meanwhile, the company's cloud computing unit has been seeing strong profitability growth as it benefits from AI while letting low-margin project-based contracts roll off. Last quarter, its cloud revenue climbed 7% to $4.2 billion, but the segment's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) soared 89% to $379 million. It noted that AI-related revenue surged by triple digits.Continuing its AI momentum, the company recently announced it will partner with Apple to power Apple Intelligence in China. The two companies have submitted co-developed AI features for regulatory approval. Apple had apparently tried to partner with other Chinese companies, including Baidu, Tencent, and TikTok owner ByteDance, but Alibaba's model proved to be the best fit, while Baidu's model, its original first choice, did not meet its standards.Apple is hoping to bring Apple Intelligence to China soon with a future operating system (iOS) update. The iPhone has fallen behind in China due to competition from local competitors, as well as having no AI-approved features. It hopes bringing Apple Intelligence to China will help boost sales in the country.As China continues to make strides in AI and investors look to invest in Chinese AI companies, Alibaba will be in a great spot for a bull run.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "By Jaiveer Shekhawat and Niket Nishant(Reuters) -Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) stock fell over 1% in pre-market trading on Friday, despite beating fourth-quarter profit estimates on Thursday. The results were driven by higher trading volumes in bitcoin and other digital tokens following the U.S. election.Unprecedented interest in crypto, fueled by Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election, pushed bitcoin beyond $100,000 in the quarter as investors anticipated more crypto friendly policies under the new administration.Trump has promised to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\". Paul Atkins, his pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is known for his pro-crypto views - a sharp contrast to former Chair Gary Gensler, who likened the industry to the \"Wild West\".\"We're really entering a golden age for crypto here. The opportunity in front of us is unprecedented to update the financial system and increase economic freedom around the world, the regulatory overhang is lifting,\" CEO Brian Armstrong said on a post-earnings call.Coinbase earned $4.68 per share for the three months ended December 31, while analysts were expecting a profit of $1.81 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.The profit included $476 million in pre-tax gains on its crypto asset investment portfolio.Its transaction revenue rose 172% to $1.6 billion. Revenue from the subscription and services unit, which houses businesses outside of trading, rose 15% to $641 million.Total revenue rose to $2.3 billion from $953.8 million a year earlier.\"Compared to Robinhood, whose earnings we saw yesterday, Coinbase has a much greater number of tokens available to trade and already has a number of value-added services like staking and stablecoin access,\" Ava Labs President John Wu said.Its offering will only get richer as we see more regulatory clarity around crypto in the U.S., but to defend its market share it must continue to diversify away from retail and make inroads into the institutional trading community, he added.Competition in the crypto trading market is intensifying, with rival Robinhood cementing itself as a popular option for traders looking to bet on digital currencies.Though it lists fewer tokens than Coinbase, the company has been steadily gaining market share and is poised to gain ground further under a crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a note from Bernstein last month.On Wednesday, Robinhood reported a 700% jump in fourth-quarter transaction-based revenue from crypto trading.(Reporting by Jaiveer Singh Shekhawat and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)"

Microsoft dipped about 0.5% and Amazon slid 0.7%.Trump tasked his economics team on Thursday to devise plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S. imports, although the directive stopped short of imposing fresh tariffs.Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick for commerce secretary, said the administration would address affected countries individually and said studies of the issue would be completed by April 1.The imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a bigger-than-expected rise in January's consumer prices and hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell added to market volatility this week.\"It's all about Trump right now. All the other stuff is just noise,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading in Ontario, Canada. \"What everyone is focused on is, 'What is Trump going to do next, and where are his tariff wars going?'\"Stocks received a boost earlier this week after data showed U.S. producer prices increased in January, while key elements in the core Personal Consumption Expenditures index, a measure closely tracked by the Fed, were benign or lower.Traders are pricing in at least one 25 basis-point interest rate cut by the end of the year, with a roughly 50% chance of an additional cut, according to LSEG data.The S&P 500 edged down 0.01% to end the session at 6,114.63 points.The Nasdaq gained 0.41% to 20,026.77 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.37% to 44,546.08 points.Of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, seven declined, led lower by consumer staples, down 1.16%, followed by a 1.11% loss in healthcare.Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 14.4 billion shares traded, compared with an average of 15.0 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.5%, while the Nasdaq gained 2.6% and the Dow added 0.5%.Airbnb jumped 14% after the vacation home rentals company posted higher quarterly revenue.DaVita dropped 11% after the dialysis firm projected annual profit below estimates. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway also sold some of its shares in the company.Applied Materials fell 8% after the chipmaking equipment maker forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates.U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.Declining stocks outnumbered rising ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.3-to-one ratio.The S&P 500 posted 37 new highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and 83 new lows.(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California, and Shashwat Chauhan and Sukriti Gupta in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Matthew Lewis)"

The company's stock rose nearly 14% in early trading on Thursday, hitting its highest since 2021, and added about $6 billion to the company's market value.The competition for crypto traders is heating up at a time when animal spirits sweep over the sector, fueled by President Donald Trump's return to the White House.His pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" propelled bitcoin past $100,000 for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"Robinhood is our best idea for 2025. We expect continued momentum in crypto prices, leading to record trading volumes,\" analysts at Bernstein said.While the company currently offers trading in fewer tokens than Coinbase, it has been steadily gaining market share and could be boosted further under a crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission, they wrote last month.Robinhood blew past Wall Street expectations for quarterly earnings on Wednesday.\"Trading volumes in equities, options and crypto surged in the fourth quarter, which is a sign that retail traders have confidence in all risk markets across the board,\" said Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at Themes ETFs.\"Its hard to predict when the transaction revenue growth will end, but perhaps the long historical investment norm of buy and hold has retired with the baby boomers,\" Marino added.STEEP CLIMBWhile growth at Robinhood has been strong, outmaneuvering crypto native exchanges such as Coinbase could be an uphill task.\"Coinbase, Kraken and Binance serve a more crypto-focused consumer. (They) also appear in far more jurisdictions,\" said Kadan Stadelmann, Chief Technology Officer at decentralized crypto exchange Komodo Platform.Coinbase currently lists over 200 tokens, while Robinhood has around 22 on its platform, according to Bernstein.Trevor Koverko, co-founder of data management platform Sapien.io, also said it might be difficult to compete head-on with native exchanges that are \"purpose-built for crypto\".However, Robinhood is no stranger to disrupting markets, having pioneered a commission-free trading model in 2013 that shook up an industry long dominated by the likes of Vanguard, Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments.A decade on, it is also expanding to cater to more seasoned investors and capture market share from incumbents.\"The fact that Robinhood had such a surge in revenues across its entire platform is more than just an appetite for risk in the marketplace - its also a testament to the adoption of its platform and the fact that the next generation of traders prefer what Robinhood is offering versus competitors,\" Marino said.Coinbase is scheduled to report its results later on Thursday.

        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) stock fell more than 5% Thursday after the company's mixed fourth quarter earnings results posted late Wednesday failed to meet investors' high expectations.Reddit's diluted earnings per share of $0.36 fell below analysts' estimates of $0.48. Reddit's daily active users in the December quarter hit 101.7 million, up nearly 40% from 2023 but less than the 103.8 million expected.The social media platform's fourth quarter revenue rose more than 70% from the prior year to $427.7 million, surpassing Wall Street's forecast of $405.5 million, according to Bloomberg consensus data.Shares of the company initially fell as much as 18% after the results.CEO Steve Huffman said on a call with analysts Wednesday evening that the platform's traffic had experienced \"some volatility\" due to a change in Google Search's algorithm late in the fourth quarter. Huffman said that \"traffic from [Google] Search has recovered so far in Q1 and we've regained momentum.\"\"We see volatility from Google all the time, as does everybody,\" Huffman told analysts, \"So there's zero concern from us in this department.\"Huffman added that the disruption affected \"logged out users,\" or those who do not have Reddit accounts. The CEO said the social media company is working to convert those users into active account holders by streamlining the signup process and improving their personalized home screens.Reddit is also enhancing its internal AI-powered search tool, Reddit Answers, to attract users and encourage them to rely on it instead of Google Search.Though Reddit's fourth quarter earnings were mixed, its guidance for the first quarter came in ahead of analysts' projections.The platform said it expects revenue between $360 million and $370 million in the first quarter of 2025, more than the $359 million Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg had forecast. Reddit anticipates that it will record adjusted earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $80 million to $90 million, more than the $72 million expected by analysts.Raymond James analyst Josh Beck called Thursday's pullback in Reddit shares a \"buying opportunity,\" pointing to Reddit's \"sharp\" recovery in traffic following the Google algorithm changes.\"While the report did not clear our anticipated bar, we walk away encouraged by international upside, ad progress and early positive response from [Reddit] Answers that likely is combined with Search to improve on-platform searchability,\" Beck wrote in a note to investors late Wednesday.He sees shares rising to $250 over the next year, a price target he raised earlier this week from his previous outlook of $200.JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target on Reddit shares to a more modest $185 from $142, given the company's continued strength in digital advertising revenue growth, but maintained a Neutral rating.Reddit's revenue has surpassed analysts' expectations in every quarter since the company went public last March, thanks to deals with AI tech giants and the success of its digital advertising business. Reddit and OpenAI announced a partnership last May, which allows OpenAI to use Reddit content to train its large language model. Reddit has a similar content licensing deal with Google reportedly worth about $60 million per year.The social media platform in October reported its first-ever profit as a public company during its third quarter, driven by AI-fueled growth in its advertising revenue, sending Reddit shares skyrocketing. The company also reported a profitable fourth quarter, recording a net income of $71 million.Investors view Reddit in part as an AI play. Shares of the social networking company, which became known as a destination for investor chatter during the post-pandemic meme stock craze, have risen nearly 26% since the start of 2025 and 337% from February 2024.

His total pay for 2023 was $26.9 million, down from $32.7 million a year earlier, according to regulatory filings last year.The decision was taken by the board of directors of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, earlier this week.The compensation incentive comes after the New York-based asset manager aggressively expanded into rapidly growing private markets through several bumper acquisitions in 2024.BlackRock spent about $25 billion last year on infrastructure investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners and private credit business HPS Investment Partners. It also struck a $3.2 billion deal to acquire UK data provider Preqin as it seeks to offer indexes for private markets.As its private markets business is growing, a compensation committee of the board of directors decided the CEOs pay should better match the value generated by the business, said BlackRock in the SEC filing.\"The carry incentive further aligns CEO compensation to both the evolution of BlackRocks private markets platform ... as well as the corresponding expansion of Mr. Finks executive responsibilities,\" it said.The incentive will be part of Fink's annual pay starting from his 2024 year-end total compensation package.\"Mr. Fink's potential future carry distributions, if any, are 100% at-risk based on the ultimate performance of the participating funds,\" said BlackRock.Since co-founding BlackRock in 1988, Fink, 72, has been at the helm, but a wave of senior executive departures over the past year has reignited speculation about when - and to whom - he will ultimately pass the torch.U.S. President Donald Trump plans to close the so-called carried interest tax loophole that allows private equity and hedge fund financiers to pay a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income.(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Tom Hogue)"

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "Good news has been difficult to come by for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors lately, which is evident from the roughly 10% decline in the company's stock price in the past three months.The once high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock has been weighed down by multiple headwinds despite delivering outstanding growth and guiding above expectations when it released its latest quarterly results in November last year. From concerns about a slowdown in its growth on account of weakening AI chip demand to intensifying competition to export-related restrictions to the recent breakthrough claimed by Chinese start-up DeepSeek, a number of factors outside of Nvidia's control have pulled the stock down.However, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE: TSM) sales data for January 2025 suggests that investors' concerns about the health of AI chip demand and Nvidia's performance may be overblown. Let's see why that may be the case.Nvidia is a fabless chipmaker, which means that it doesn't own any fabrication plants and simply designs chips. The manufacturing is done by TSMC, the world's leading semiconductor foundry that fabricates chips for fabless chipmakers and consumer electronics companies. That's why the 36% year-over-year jump in TSMC's revenue last month is an indicator that the demand for Nvidia's AI chips hasn't waned.More importantly, TSMC reported revenue growth of 58% and 34% in the final two months of 2024. As Nvidia's fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 coincides with these three months, there is a solid chance that the chipmaker could exceed Wall Street's expectations when it releases its results later this month.Of course, Nvidia is not the only customer that TSMC has. However, it is worth noting that Nvidia was reportedly TSMC's second-largest customer in 2023, accounting for 11% of the latter's revenue. Also, recent developments indicate that Nvidia's share of TSMC's revenue may have increased. For instance, Apple, which was TSMC's biggest customer in 2023, noted a 4% year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter of 2024.So, it is likely that TSMC may have produced more chips for Nvidia in the past three months, and that could translate into stronger sales growth for the latter. Another thing worth noting here is that TSMC is expected to increase its advanced packaging capacity this year by around 85% to a range of 65,000 to 75,000 wafers per month to meet the robust demand for AI chips.Nvidia is expected to get its hands on 63% of this increased capacity. Rivals such as Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices are projected to be distantly placed in second and third positions with 13% and 8% share, respectively. All this indicates that Nvidia's AI chip supply chain is likely to get stronger in 2025.Throw in the fact that major cloud computing providers such as Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are set to raise their capex substantially this year, and Nvidia's improved supply chain could help it fulfill more orders and sustain its impressive growth. These four tech giants are set to raise their combined capital expenses by 46% in 2025 to a whopping $325 billion as they will continue to spend more money to build out AI infrastructure.The discussion above makes it clear that Nvidia is on track to benefit from a favorable AI chip demand environment. At the same time, the company's focus on bolstering its supply chain to fulfill more demand and the terrific increase in TSMC's revenue of late provide further indication that Nvidia should be able to sustain its healthy growth rate this year.Analysts expect a 52% jump in Nvidia's revenue to almost $196 billion in the new fiscal year (which has just begun). However, don't be surprised to see Nvidia exceeding that mark, as the incremental capital spending of $102 billion by big tech players in 2025 is going to be higher than the roughly $83 billion incremental spending last year.Nvidia is in a terrific position to corner the lion's share of this increased capital spending as it is expected to control 85% of the AI chip market this year. As such, a stronger-than-expected showing from Nvidia seems in the cards when it releases its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26, and that could be just the catalyst that this AI stock needs to regain its mojo.Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasnt one of them.

However, the company forecast slower first-quarter growth due to tough year-over-year comparisons and a stronger dollar.The vacation home rentals company said it was benefiting from continued growth in Latin America and sustained cross-border travel demand in Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Shares of the company were up 14% in trading after the bell.Airbnb forecast first-quarter revenue of $2.23 billion to $2.27 billion, a 4% to 6% increase, compared with a year earlier. The company said revenue growth benefited during the same period in 2024 from the timing of Easter and the inclusion of Leap Day.The average daily rate, or the cost per night, is expected to decline slightly year-over-year in the first quarter due to exchange rates.A strong U.S. currency is making it more expensive for multinational companies like Airbnb to convert profits booked abroad into dollars. In January, the U.S. dollar index reached a two-year high.Excluding the impact of the calendar and foreign exchange rate, Airbnb anticipates revenue to increase in the range of 10% to 12% from a year earlier.The company expects Nights and Experiences Booked in the first quarter to be flat, compared with the same period a year earlier, when excluding Leap Day. About 133 million nights and experiences were booked in the first quarter of 2024.The San Francisco-based company said it was benefiting from the launch of its co-host network four months ago which allows a manager to take care of guests and the property on behalf of the owner. It said that co-host listings earn about twice as much as other Airbnb listings in comparable countries.Airbnb also said it plans to invest $200 million to $250 million towards launching and scaling new businesses during the year.Revenue rose 11.8% to $2.48 billion for the fourth quarter ended December 31, compared with Wall Street estimates of $2.42 billion.The company posted earnings of 73 cents per share, compared with analyst expectations of 58 cents per share.(Reporting by Aishwarya Jain in Bengaluru and Doyinsola Oladipo in New York; Editing by Anil D'Silva)"

Shares jumped 14% in extended trading on Thursday.The surge in political ad spending and the launch of streaming channels like Peacock, Disney+ and HBO Max have boosted Roku's subscriber base, ad revenue and overall growth.\"We continue to make progress growing ad demand through deeper third-party platform integrations, improving the Roku Experience (which starts at our Home Screen) to expand monetization, and growing Roku-billed subscriptions,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders.Roku has expanded its advertising offerings to small- and medium-sized businesses, leveraging its home screen to diversify revenue streams across sectors.Brands from retail, automotive and telecom feature their ads on the platform, enhancing visibility and boosting user engagement. This move allows businesses to tap into Roku's extensive user base.The company's platform segment, which derives revenue from ad sales and subscriptions, grew 25% to $1.04 billion due to advertising activities, particularly from the political vertical.Ahead of the results, Barton Crockett from Rosenblatt said: \"Political advertising on connected TV (CTV) stepped up meaningfully this cycle versus the last cycle, in part because of a big push into the medium by Kamala Harris.\"The Trump administration has recently imposed tariffs on electronics, particularly those imported from China. In a post-earnings call, Roku executives mentioned that while these tariffs could broadly impact the industry, they are not expected to have a material effect on the company's platform business.The company reported revenue of $1.20 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to the analysts' average estimate of $1.15 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.For the full year, Roku expects net revenue of $4.61 billion, compared to analysts' consensus estimate of $4.59 billion.(Reporting by Priyanka.G in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)"

Power VDS, now in its 36th year, covers 184 specific problem areas across vehicle categories, like infotainment systems, diver assistance tech, powertrain, and interior and exterior features, across the first three years of ownership.Toyotas (TM) Lexus brand snagged the top honors in vehicle dependability for a third consecutive year, with a score of 140 PP100 (problems per 100 vehicles). GM's (GM) Buick brand ranked highest in the mass market segment, with a score of 143. Mazda (MZDAY) came in second with 161, and Toyota, at 162, came third.At the premium end, Cadillac (169) ranks second behind overall winner Lexus (also a premium brand), with Germanys Porsche (186) coming in third.On the flip side, Volkswagen (285), Chrysler (282, Jeep (275), VWs Audi (273), and Land Rover (270) suffered the most issues and ranked in the bottom five. Tesla ranked in the middle of the pack (209).J.D. Power said the 2025 VDS is based on responses from 34,175 owners of 2022 model-year vehicles after three years of ownership. The VDS differs from J.D. Powers widely followed initial quality survey, which covers issues dealing with the first year of ownership.Overall, problems with software defects and personal device integration (i.e., connecting iPhones and Android devices), plus issues with plug-in hybrid EVs, plagued owners of those cars bought back in 2022. J.D. Power found that the industry overall saw a 6% increase in problems (12 PP100) from a year ago.While the increase in problems this year may be a thorn in the side of automakers and owners, its important to remember that todays three-year-old vehicles were built during a time when the industry was grappling with major disruptions, said Jason Norton, director of auto benchmarking at J.D. Power. Supply chain issues, record-high vehicle prices, and personnel disruption in the wake of the pandemic were problematic.Overall, Toyota and GM products received the most model-level awards, with six each.The most dependable model overall across all brands was Toyotas Avalon sedan, a full-size vehicle that, interestingly, isnt one of Toyotas top sellers. The highest-ranked compact car was the Toyota Corolla, followed by the Kia Forte and Subaru Impreza. The premium segment had the BMWs stalwart 3 series on top, with the 4 Series in second.The midsize car segment had the top-selling Camry taking top honors, followed by Nissans Altima and the Hyundai Sonata. The Chevrolet Corvette had the highest score in the premium sporty car segment.In the SUV and truck space, award winners included the Lexus GX, Toyota RAV4 and Sienna, Cadillac XT6, Chevrolet Tahoe and Silverado, and the Nissan Kicks and Murano.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "source": "Motley Fool",
        "content": "More than two months ago, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) made a surprising move. It pushed CEO Pat Gelsinger out the door. The board of directors did so without lining up a replacement and named two interim co-CEOs in his place, CFO David Zinsner and CEO of Intel Products Michelle Johnston (MJ) Holthaus.In some ways, the move made sense. The stock had floundered under Gelsinger as Intel struggled to overcome past missteps, gain ground in AI, and turn its foundry business profitable. However, in other ways, the timing was odd. Gelsinger was in the middle of a massive restructuring of Intel's foundry business, opening it up to outside customers and giving investors a forecast that called for it to generate massive profits by the end of the decade.According to reports, the chip titan is struggling to find a permanent CEO to replace Gelsinger, and that shouldn't come as a surprise. In a number of ways, the next candidate looks set up for failure. Now, Intel's leadership hole is getting even deeper as its chief of the data center and AI segment is jumping ship for Nokia.Nokia said on Monday that Justin Hotard, the leader of Intel's data center and AI segment, will replace outgoing CEO Pekka Lundmark on April 1.The move comes a little more than a year after Intel recruited Hotard from Hewlett Packard Enterprise to run the key growth division. Intel has not released a statement on Hotard's departure, though he said in Nokia's press release: \"I am honored by the opportunity to lead Nokia, a global leader in connectivity with a unique heritage in technology.\"Intel has already named an interim replacement for Hotard, tapping Karin Eibschitz Segal to head the data center and AI unit. Segal has previously run Intel's operations in Israel.Executives change jobs for all types of reasons, and Hotard may have simply jumped at the opportunity to be CEO of a well-known tech company, but the departure throws the company's growth strategy into further disarray.It's also possible that Hotard could have been frustrated with the broader turnaround at Intel. The company announced massive layoffs in August. That month, Lip-Bu Tan, a veteran of the semiconductor industry, left the board after expressing frustration with the company's bloated workforce and risk-averse culture.Following Gelsinger's exit, Hotard could have also felt that the company was headed in the wrong direction.Intel's latest quarter showed that even its data center and AI segment -- its biggest segment after client computing -- continues to struggle, even as peers like Nvidia, AMD, and Micron have posted scorching growth in the data center in their recent quarters. Intel, meanwhile, saw data center and AI revenue decline 3% to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter as overall revenue was down 7% to $14.3 billion.Notably, investors didn't seem bothered by the news, as Intel stock rose on Monday. But that was likely due to news that its subsidiary Mobileye was teaming up with Lyft to launch robotaxis in 2026.On its recent earnings call, Intel said that the board continues to be \"intensely focused\" on finding a permanent CEO and that the search was progressing.However, media reports have indicated that the company isn't close to naming a new CEO. It's a big decision for the struggling chipmaker, and it put itself in a hole by ousting Gelsinger first rather than working on finding a replacement for him behind the scenes. With Hotard's departure, it seems like Intel is taking another step backward at a time when the company desperately needs to fill its leadership ranks with capable talent.That the company's revenue is declining by 7% at a time when the entire industry is seeing tailwinds from the AI boom shows how desperate things have become for Intel.The longer the company goes without a permanent CEO, the less likely it is to succeed in its turnaround. Losing its AI chief only adds insult to injury.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "More CEOs fed up with Delaware and its powerful Chancery Court are going the way of Elon Musk, reincorporating their companies elsewhere and publicly airing their frustrations.Over the past year, Meta (META), Dropbox (DBX), hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Trade Desk (TTD), Fidelity National Financial (FNF), and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals (SNOA) have all floated plans to move their incorporations out of the \"first state\"  a nickname granted to Delaware because it was the first to ratify the US Constitution.These so-called \"Dexits\" would follow Musk-led companies Tesla (TSLA), SpaceX, the Boring Company, Neuralink, and X that left or are trying to leave Delaware.\"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware, Musk said on X in January 2024 after the Chancery Courts head judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, struck down a 2018 Tesla shareholder vote approving his $56 billion performance-based compensation deal.I think there is a lot of pressure on Delaware, said University of Virginia Law School professor Michal Barzuza. And I think the more moving, the easier it becomes for others to move.Bill Ackman, Pershing Squares CEO, went public with his decision on the social platform X, owned by Musk, saying he had chosen Nevada.\"Top law firms are recommending Nevada and Texas over Delaware,\" Ackman wrote.For roughly the last century, Delaware has been the dominant place to incorporate because of its so-called corporate-friendly laws, specialized business courts, and ease of filing company documents.The state touts that it is home to more than two-thirds of all Fortune 500 companies. In 2023, Delaware hit a record 2 million total incorporations but saw a drop in the percentage of Fortune 500 companies registered there to 67.6% from 68.2% in 2022.Delaware generated $1.33 billion in incorporation revenue in 2024, about 22% of the states total revenue.Places like Nevada, Texas, South Dakota, North Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming that want some of this same revenue are trying to chip away at Delawares dominance with their own business-friendly strategies.\"Delaware is at serious risk of losing its standing as the leading state of incorporation for American companies,\" Coinbases (COIN) chief legal officer Paul Grewal posted on X earlier this month.Those recruiting efforts got a boost last year from the worlds richest man, Musk, when Tesla shareholders voted to incorporate in Texas instead of Delaware  a move made in reaction to the ruling against Musk's pay.But even that reincorporation is held up in the Chancery Court, in a separate case before the same judge who voided Musk's compensation. The suit, filed by an investor who challenged the vote, alleged that the reincorporation was designed to shield Musk from Delaware law.A similar reincorporation scuffle arose between Tripadvisor (TRIP) and two of its shareholders in 2023, before Musks attempted Dexits.In Maffei v. Palkon, shareholders opposed a vote favoring reincorporation in Nevada, alleging the measure would have failed without votes from Gregory Maffei, the companys then-controlling stockholder.The conflict came to an end last week when Delawares Supreme Court overturned the Chancery Courts vice chancellor, J. Travis Laster, unanimously holding that the lower court applied the wrong standard to evaluate the board-recommended move.The high court disagreed with Chancery that the more rigorous entire fairness standard should be applied and said the decision was subject to the more lenient business judgment rule.The recent high-profile departures from Delaware are attracting attention from the state's newly elected governor, Matt Meyer, a business lawyer, who launched a working group to study mounting complaints directed at the court.\"Im hearing something similar from a number of Delaware companies and attorneys,\" Meyer said in an interview with CNBC. \"That they feel like they get the same judge every time when they come to Delaware business court, and they dont feel like they are getting a fair hearing.\"Phil Shawe, CEO and co-founder of the translation service company TransPerfect, is another executive who moved his company from the state and is now telling Governor Meyer that he was treated unfairly by the court.Shawe spent years there in litigation against his TransPerfect co-founder and co-director.When the pair became deadlocked over the businesss direction, the court concluded the impasse posed irreparable harm to the company. To address the perceived harm, the judge appointed a custodian to run a court-ordered sale.They ran an auction and didn't produce a higher price than what I had already offered [the co-founder] years earlier, Shawe said, alleging the auction exceeded the courts authority.How the judge came to this conclusion to do this is very suspect, because the business was always growing in revenue, and profit, so there was never a real imminent harm that required a judge to take control of the business.Shawe ultimately outbid his challengers and purchased his co-founders half of the company, though after spending millions on lawyers and court fees. He has since backed advocacy group Citizens for Judicial Fairness (formerly Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware) to push the court for more transparency and equity.There is something wrong with that system, Shawe said.Israeli technology investor Itzik On is another executive moving his companies out of the state and says he is frustrated with the Chancery Court.\"I'm very afraid of the Delaware system going against entrepreneurs. I think it's a systematic risk against the entire corporate world and the entire startup world,\" On said. \"You start considering: Why should I invest in the US? Now it's become risky.\"On, Movado's sole director, claims the court allowed an investor and shareholder in his now-dissolved healthcare startup, Movado PT Technologies, who was also an executive at a competing healthcare company, to maintain a derivative claim against him.The Movado shareholder claimed On did not fully inform shareholders about material issues including executive compensation terms and conflicts of interest among executives.\"You cant have a derivative complaint when a shareholder is a rival,\" On said.He also disagreed with the judges invalidation of two shareholder votes ratifying all board actions, including executive compensation, on grounds that the votes were the product of a fiduciary breach.On calls himself a small player as an investment manager for 24 US startups. However, he argues that Chancery dealt him a fate similar to Musk's when the court held there was a fiduciary breach despite two shareholder votes.\"The second you have this [fiduciary breach] tag, youve lost,\" On said. \"Now everyone is at risk for fiduciary breach.\"On and his sister are appealing their case to the Delaware Supreme Court. In the meantime, he said, \"All our companies are exiting Delaware.\"Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow Alexis on X @alexiskweed."

        "content": "Coinbase (COIN) cashed in for the final quarter of 2024.Shares of the crypto exchange fell slightly to $295.18 each in premarket trading on Friday, despite a better-than-expected earnings report the night before. The pullback in the stock likely reflects its mixed guidance for the first quarter, as an increase in marketing spending could bring a sequential step-down in profit margins.But the chatter on Wall Street is that the stock's muted reaction shows watchers are missing the forest for the trees.\"We think management guided conservatively for the first quarter,\" JPMorgan analyst Ken Worthington wrote in a client note.There are tailwinds for its business: the higher bitcoin prices that also benefited rival Robinhood's (HOOD) quarter this week and bullishness on the Trump crypto regulatory backdrop. Given those, Coinbase may be set up to surprise in the first quarter.The crypto exchange's transaction revenue of $1.55 billion in the fourth quarter marked its highest level since the same period in 2021. Retail and institutional trading volumes of $94 billion and $345 billion, respectively, hit three-year highs.Coinbase executives laid out their top policy priorities for the Trump administration on an earnings call with analysts. These include market structure issues such as token classification, and stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar.\"President Trump is moving fast to fulfill his promise of making US the crypto capital of the planet. And the most pro-crypto Congress we've ever seen is now leading the charge on stablecoin and market structure legislation. Given the US's leadership here, the rest of the world is taking notice and will be under pressure to embrace crypto adoption,\" Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong said on the call.Armstrong's bullish assessment of the regulatory backdrop is in line with what he told me at the World Economic Forum several weeks ago (video above).Here is what Wall Street is saying about Coinbase's quarter and outlook.Rating: Reiterated HoldPrice Target: $300, reiterated\"On the back of the post-election jump in crypto asset prices, retail trading volume and retail transaction volume grew nearly 3x quarter over quarter (stable take rate) and adjusted operating margins expanded to 57%  the third highest level on record.\"A more supportive US administration/Congress has created a 'sea change' in the regulatory backdrop for crypto. Quarter to date trends suggest another quarter similar to 4Q, but higher sales and marketing spend will drive a step down in margins quarter over quarter.\"Rating: Reiterated NeutralPrice Target: $344, previously $264\"Given the valuation and potential near-term volatility until we get greater regulatory certainty, our rating is unchanged at Neutral; however, our December 2025 price target jumps to $344 (from $264 prior) driven by our fiscal year EPS number nearly doubling on the higher base the fourth quarter set.

It also saw a 30% growth in nights booked for domestic travel in Latin America, led by Brazil, compared to last year. First-time bookers in the region grew by nearly 15% sequentially.The short-term rentals platform said growth in expansion markets was twice that of their core markets.\"This instills confidence in our forecast for international markets to add tens of billions in bookings over the next several years,\" said Morningstar analyst, Dan Wasiolek.Airbnb also said it plans to invest $200 million to $250 million towards a new travel-related business which would be launched in May.The company expects to launch one or two businesses every single year for the next five years, CEO Brian Chesky said on the post-earnings conference call.\"I think that each business could take three to five years to scale.

Moderna's stock was down 5% in premarket trading on the earnings results but rose more than 2% sharply after the opening bell.Moderna reported $966 million in fourth quarter revenue, beating Wall Street estimates of $954 million. The company also reported full-year revenue of $3.2 billion, in line with expectations. Moderna missed on earnings per share, reporting a loss in the quarter of $2.91 per share, compared to Wall Street's expected loss of $2.75. For the full year, the company also missed on earnings per share, reporting a loss of $9.28 per share compared to consensus estimates of $9.17.The revenue beat came largely from sales of the company's biggest product, the COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax, which brought in $3.1 billion for the year. Moderna's other product, a Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine, brought in $15 million in the year. The company's loss came from lower sales versus the previous year and a one-time $238 million charge to end a manufacturing contract.The company has been under pressure to continue to deliver strong results despite the waning demand for COVID-19 vaccines. Investors have also been watching the company's efforts to prop up its clinical pipeline.\"There's really no visible path to profitability that we see on the horizon,\" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Yahoo Finance Friday.In a statement Friday, CEO Stephane Bancel noted that the company worked to reduce costs by 27% in 2024 compared to 2023.In 2025, we remain focused on driving sales, delivering up to 10 product approvals through 2027, and expanding cost efficiencies across our business. By the end of 2025, we aim to remove nearly $1 billion in costs,\" Bancel said.There is also concern about how Moderna will operate under a new administration in Washington with the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm of the Health and Human Services (HHS) department. RFK Jr. has been a vocal critic of vaccines and questioned their effectiveness and safety  which could bode poorly for companies like Moderna whose pipeline consists entirely of vaccines.The stock didn't move after RFK Jr.'s confirmation on Thursday. But Bank of America Securities analysts wrote in a note they expect to hear on the topic from Bancel during an earnings call on Friday.\"Focus of the call will likely include 2025 guidance, RFK Jr implications at HHS, clinical catalysts, and upcoming launches,\" the note said.This story has been updated.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been losing steam of late. Entering trading on Tuesday, shares of the popular chipmaker were in negative territory for the year, down a little under 1%. It's still early in the year, but for a stock that generated 171% gains in 2024, the slowdown is noteworthy.It remains one of the most valuable companies in the world with a market cap of around $3.3 trillion, but despite its high valuation, there's a case to be made that Nvidia may still be a great buy. And based on one metric, it may even be a steal of a deal right now.A multiple that investors often use to value stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That tells you how expensive a stock is in relation to its profitability, on a per-share basis. But P/E multiples can vary based on how much growth a business is generating and the sector that it's in. Nvidia's P/E multiple is more than 50, which seems high, but it may be justifiable if you're expecting a lot of growth from the business down the road.This is where a multiple such as the price/earnings-to-growth ratio, or PEG, comes in handy. It factors in analyst expectations for future growth. If the PEG ratio is around 1 or less, that's generally an indicator it's a great buy based on expected growth. According to data from Yahoo! Finance, Nvidia's PEG ratio, based on its expected growth rate for the next five years, currently sits at 0.96, suggesting that is a deal given the current outlook from analysts.Based on its low PEG multiple, it may be tempting to think that Nvidia still has a lot more upside. And it might, over the long term. But the PEG ratio relies on analyst estimates, which may change over time. And changes could happen soon, especially amid growing questions about whether tech companies are investing too heavily into artificial intelligence (AI).Investors appear to be growing concerned about tech spending due to the emergence of the DeepSeek AI model, which is supposedly as effective as ChatGPT but costs significantly less. And if that's the case, investors may be wondering whether all those Nvidia chips are truly necessary for AI development.Nvidia's massive growth in recent years has been a key reason investors have remained bullish. And if a slowdown does happen, that could very well impact the stock, potentially resulting in a sell-off. Investors will get a better idea of how strong demand is when Nvidia reports its earnings later this month, and that could ultimately dictate how hot of a buy the stock is in the weeks ahead.Nvidia has become one of the leaders in tech and it's a solid investment to buy and hold. Over the trailing 12 months, it has generated more than $63 billion in profit on sales of $113 billion. Those are fantastic margins, which give the company plenty of flexibility to lower prices or use those profits to invest in new growth opportunities.And that's why even if there is a slowdown in tech spending, the stock may still be in excellent shape over the long run as the business has the financial power to adapt to changing market conditions.There may be volatility in the next year or two if the hype in AI cools, especially since Nvidia's stock has become synonymous with AI-related developments. However, as long as you're willing to hang on for several years and potentially ride out the short-term volatility, it may not be too late to invest into this top tech stock right now.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then youll want to hear this.On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a Double Down stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If youre worried youve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before its too late.

Cherney(Reuters) - Arm has begun recruiting from its own customers and competing against them for deals as it pushes toward selling its own chips, according to people familiar with the matter and a document viewed by Reuters.Arm supplies the crucial intellectual property that firms such as Apple and Nvidia license to create their own central processing units (CPUs). It has also been seeking to expand its profits and revenues through a range of tactics, including considering whether to sell chips of its own.Arm appears to be ramping up that effort.The UK-based company has sought to recruit executives from licensees, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. And Arm is competing against Qualcomm, one of its largest customers, to sell data center CPUs to Meta Platforms, according to a person familiar with the matter.Arm spokesperson Erica Pompen declined to comment.The tech provider's moves to build out its own chip business could upend an industry that has long viewed the company as a neutral player rather than a competitor, by forcing companies who rely on Arm technology to consider whether they will end up competing against the firm for business.Arm took a dispute with Qualcomm over its licensing rates to court in December, though the UK-based company lost key elements of that trial. During questioning at the trial, Arm CEO Rene Haas said, \"we don't build chips\" when asked about the company's ambitions outlined in a board proposal to do so.But Arm sought to hire executives from its customers as early as November, several weeks before that testimony, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.A recruiter working for Arm sent a message to an executive at an Arm customer seeking to hire employees. The note, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters, said Arm wanted to hire an executive to help with its \"transformation from solely designing processor architecture (IP) to also selling its own silicon, with a focus on driving AI enablement in the data center\" and on other devices.Arm recruiters have contacted other chip designers in Silicon Valley in an attempt to lure talent for the same purpose, according to two industry sources.Arm is also competing with Qualcomm for business. Qualcomm was in discussions with Facebook owner Meta Platforms to supply it with a data center central processing unit based on Arm's computing architecture, but Arm has won at least some of that business, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another person familiar with the discussions said that talks between Meta and Qualcomm are ongoing.The Financial Times earlier reported Arm's deal with Meta.Qualcomm spokesperson Yelena Tebcherani and Meta spokesperson Melanie Roe declined to comment.Arm may also be seeking to compete with Nvidia, according to a research note published Thursday from J.P. Morgan's Harlan Sur. Broadcom has won a contract for an effort by Arm and SoftBank Group to create a purpose-built artificial intelligence chip that will power data centers at the Japanese company, Sur wrote.The deal may be worth as much as $30 billion in revenue for Broadcom, Sur wrote.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; editing by Edward Tobin)"

The adjusted profit per share came in at C$4.07, below estimates of C$4.27.Consumer confidence in Canada had seen an uptick following interest rate cuts, Hicks said during a post-earnings call.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The ripple effects of US President Donald Trumps pro-crypto agenda are fueling a surge in Bitcoin demand in Japan, where one hoteliers pivot to stockpiling the cryptocurrency is delivering eye-watering returns for shareholders.Most Read from BloombergNice Airport, If You Can Get to It: No Subway, No Highway, No BridgeSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterSin puente y sin metro: el nuevo aeropuerto de Lima es una debacleThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleIn New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay SuperShares of Metaplanet Inc. are up around 4,800% over the past 12 months, the largest gain among all Japanese equities in that period and one of the highest globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin itself hit a record high of $109,241 on Jan. 20 as Trump was sworn in for his second term, although its since erased some of those gains as his trade policies fanned global instability.Metaplanet is one of a number of outfits around the world that aim to emulate the success of Michael Saylors Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy Inc. The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company has morphed into a leveraged Bitcoin proxy and behemoth after accumulating more than $45 billion of the token.Metaplanets CEO, former Goldman Sachs equity derivatives trader Simon Gerovich, said he was drawn to the idea after hearing about Saylors strategy on a podcast. Hed been running Metaplanet, formerly Red Planet Japan Inc., as a hotel developer since 2013, but shifted to a Bitcoin-first strategy in early 2024 after a pandemic slowdown forced the company to shutter all but one of its hotels.Since then, Metaplanets shareholders have increased to almost 50,000, growing by 500% in 2024, according to the company. Shareholders include Capital Group  which also invests in Strategy  but the vast majority are retail investors, many of whom have limited experience with volatile crypto assets.Metaplanet has such high exposure to the volatile retail base, said Rhiannon Ewart-White, Japan equity analyst and managing director of UK-based Storm Research. They need to make sure shareholders understand exactly what their strategy is.After six straight years of losses, the company reported 350 million ($2.3 million) in operating profit for the year ended December 2024 on Monday. The results will likely bolster Metaplanets stock further, said Ewart-White.Gerovich, who attended Trumps inauguration ceremony in Washington last month, told Bloomberg in an interview that the excitement around a more Bitcoin-friendly regulatory environment in the US has catapulted demand in Japan for the token.The company isnt Japans only MicroStrategy-copycat. Software developer Remixpoint Inc., for example, announced a plan to buy 1.2 billion in Bitcoin last September, and has seen its stock grow over 300% since.A large chunk of Metaplanets retail shareholders bought shares via the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) program, which Japans government revamped in early 2024 to encourage citizens to invest their savings for long-term growth and retirement.Getto Hagiya, an 18-year-old robotics student from Tokyo, bought Metaplanet shares as his first investment under the tax-free program. He got excited about Bitcoin after hearing Trump promote crypto-friendly policies during his campaign.I believe Bitcoin will be an indispensable asset in the future, he said.

        "content": "In just a few short months, Jack Cooper went from negotiating with General Motors on steps to shore up the auto carriers finances to permanently closing after taking two blows from the nations two largest auto makers.It was a swift end to Jack Cooper, in business for almost 100 years. It had survived a Chapter 11 process in 2019 but couldnt survive the upheaval of the past few months.Mondays announcement of Jack Coopers closure wrapped up a tumultuous period, the past five-plus weeks playing out in public beginning with the Jan. 2 notification that Jack Cooper received from Ford (NYSE: F), saying the automaker was invoking a 30-day out clause to end its relationship. News of that move by Ford trickled out over the next few days.But based on conversations with sources close to companies involved in the rupture that has ended Jack Coopers long tenure as a major auto carrier, the circumstances that led to its demise began before that over the question of financing.According to those sources, Jack Cooper and GM (NYSE: GM) had begun discussions approximately three months ago on GM supporting Jack Coopers capitalization in some form, though it would not have taken an equity stake. The dollar figure under discussion was unknown.Jack Cooper is privately held by members of the Riggs family and top executive Sarah Amico, formerly Sarah Riggs.GMs requirement was that Ford also take a role in strengthening the financial base of Jack Cooper. However, Jack Cooper executives told GM that its contractual agreements with Ford would not allow it to make such a request.Instead, Jack Cooper asked GM to make the request to Ford, according to sources. That kicked off a process of GM being rebuffed after approaching Ford. Ford eventually ended its relationship with Jack Cooper.Jack Cooper did secure a $200 million investment commitment from another unidentified party, but GM rejected that. (One source described the terms of that private equity financing as onerous.) GMs contractual arrangement with Jack Cooper allowed the automaker that kind of veto power.GMs concern was that it needed to ensure the solvency of one of its biggest auto haulers. But that solvency was in question with Fords rejection of financing and GMs decision not to green-light the private equity investment.That began the process that ultimately resulted in the rupture between GM and Jack Cooper, the final blow that led to the companys demise.A spokesman for GM declined comment on the process that led to the Jack Cooper closure or his companys role in the final outcome. However, he did say that GM has secured a new supplier to handle the capacity that was managed by Jack Cooper. He declined to identify that carrier.One possible development from the news of Jack Coopers closure: The stock price of Proficient Auto Logistics (NASDAQ: PAL), the newly publicly traded auto carrier, which touts its nonunion status, rose sharply Tuesday to hit its historical high.The stock opened near $8 per share Monday and reached the high of $11.37 Tuesday. It closed at $10.73.Proficient, which was created by a rollup of several auto carriers, began trading in May. Its low price since then was $7.24, recorded Dec. 20.More articles from John KingstonBLS revision: Far fewer workers in truck transportation than earlier estimatedIn a weak quarter for brokerages, RXOs stock price takes a pounding after earningsTrucking-backed suit may be arena for dumping Biden independent contractor ruleThe post In 3 months, Jack Cooper went from discussing new funding to closing its doors appeared first on FreightWaves."

The deal is expected to price on Thursday.A Morgan Stanley representative did not immediately provide a comment.Seven Wall Street banks got stuck with the debt after financing Elon Musks purchase of the platform, then called Twitter Inc., in 2022. Morgan Stanley orchestrated that nearly $13 billion financing package and has been leading the effort to sell the debt.The transaction being marketed now is the third in a frenetic period of less than a month.The first was a $1 billion loan sale to test the market, which priced in a range of 90-to-95 cents on the dollar. That was quickly followed up with a sale of $5.5 billion in debt for 97 cents on the dollar. Banks still hold a total of $6 billion worth of X debt.The sales mark a surprising turnaround for what had long been seen as an ill-fated financing of Musks purchase. Banks typically sell debt into the market immediately after such a buyout, but investors balked at the idea, concerned about the price Musk had paid and that his changes to content-moderation policies would drive away advertisers. That left the debt hung on banks books for over two years.But the billionaires close ties to President Donald Trump, including an advisory role, swiftly changed perceptions about Xs prospects. Investors expect Musks position in the administration to help his business interests, even as his aggressive government cost-cutting efforts have sown upheaval in Washington.In its marketing efforts, Morgan Stanley has also shared new details about Xs adjusted revenue and profits, suggesting that its finances have stabilized after a long slump.--With assistance from Aaron Weinman and Sridhar Natarajan.(Adds details about planned size and pricing, material about the history of banks holding X debt.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musks DOGE Is a Force Americans Cant Afford to IgnoreJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "The consumer price index may have been supplanted by Trump tariffs as the big economic news of the week. Although core inflation could take a turn for the better in January data, economists increasingly expect that progress to be reversed by Trump tariffs in coming months. S&P 500 futures are little changed after the stock market rally paused on Tuesday, with inflation data and more tariffs on the agenda.An extended Federal Reserve pause is looking more likely as President Trump fires off a barrage of new or expanded tariffs, including those announced Monday on steel and aluminum that have lifted Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, testifying before the Senate on Tuesday, said \"policy restraint for longer\" is likely, if the labor market remains solid yet inflation doesn't keep falling toward 2%. The S&P 500 is slightly lower ahead of Wednesday's consumer price index, following the latest escalation of Trump tariffs.The Fed's primary inflation rate, the core PCE price index, gets about 70% of its composition from the CPI and close to 30% from the producer price index. Deutsche Bank economists expect that the core PCE price index for January, which won't be released until Feb. 28, will ease to 2.6% from 2.8%. That's partly because the core PCE price index jumped 0.5% in January 2024, making for an easy year-over-year comparison.The core CPI rose a more moderate 0.4% in January 2024, which still presents room for improvement in Wednesday's figure. Economists see a 0.3% monthly increase, according to Econoday. That could see the 12-month core CPI inflation rate dip to 3.1% or hold steady at 3.2%.Thursday's PPI will include some important inputs into the core PCE price index, including its largest component, health care services prices.Powell's opening statement to the Senate in his semiannual monetary policy testimony highlighted the \"uncertainties\" the Fed faces as Trump rolls out an ambitious agenda of tax cuts, tariffs, deregulation and deportations. In a Dec. 18 news conference, Powell compared the Fed's job to \"driving on a foggy night.\" He added: \"You just slow down.\"Powell sees the Fed as being in a good position to do exactly that. With the January jobs report now in hand, Powell said that labor market conditions \"remain solid and appear to have stabilized.\" Powell noted an average of 189,000 monthly job gains over the past four months.With inflation still \"somewhat elevated\" and monetary policy \"significantly less restrictive than it had been,\" Powell said the Federal Reserve doesn't \"need to be in a hurry\" to cut again.As Powell is likely to reiterate in his testimony, the impact of tariffs on inflation is far from certain. It can depend on currency fluctuations, substitution of goods by consumers, and decisions by wholesalers and retailers about how much of a price increase they will pass along.Deutsche Bank economists led by Justin Weidner wrote in a Monday note that Trump tariffs could push the Federal Reserve's main core inflation rate above 3.5% this year. That includes the impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs, the delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico and Trump's new plan for \"reciprocal\" tariffs.The latter idea is a way for Trump to try and avoid tit-for-tat retaliation. It would have the U.S. match tariffs on goods imports from countries that have tariffs on imports from the U.S. Citing World Bank data, Deutsche Bank figures reciprocal tariffs could boost the average tariff rate on imports by 3.3 percentage points. The reciprocal tariffs, depending on how much was passed to customers, could boost inflation by 0.25 to 0.4 percentage point, they estimate.The steel and aluminum Trump tariffs might add a bit less than one-tenth of a percentage point to the inflation rate, Deutsche Bank figures, though the impact would be much higher on autos and appliances.S&P 500 futures are essentially flat ahead of the CPI. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 was up less than 0.1%, as the Federal Reserve chairman testified. The S&P 500 finished just 0.8% below the Jan. 23 record closing high.Be sure to read IBD's The Big Picture column after each trading day to get the latest on the prevailing stock market trend and what it means for your trading decisions.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top StocksWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

Meanwhile, last Tuesday, 10% tariffs went into effect on select Chinese goods.Wall Street analysts have stayed bullish on gold amid rising tariff threats.\"We continue to see gold as an effective portfolio hedge and diversifier, and believe an allocation of around 5% within a USD balanced portfolio is optimal,\" wrote Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management in a Monday note.In late January, Goldman Sachs analysts reiterated their bullish call on the precious metal as the threat of escalating tariffs drives continued demand.\"We see upside risk to our 3,000 [per troy ounce] target from a potentially persistent boost from elevated US policy uncertainty to central bank and investor hedging demand,\" wrote the analysts. They added, \"We expect modest tactical downside to gold prices if tariff uncertainty fades and positioning normalizes.\"In a Friday note, JPMorgan analysts said in the near-term, gold could fall if stocks sell off. However the threat of tariffs continues to drive prices higher.\"Bearish contagion from equities could weigh on gold in the immediate near-term but disruptive tariffs continue to fuel a medium-term bull case for bullion, skewing risks toward reaching our year-end target of $2,950 per ounce much quicker than currently expected if current tariffs are prolonged,\" wrote the analysts.Gold demand surged to new records in 2024, according to a recent World Gold Council report.\"Central banks continued to hoover up gold at an eye-watering pace\" in 2024, with purchases accelerating in the fourth quarter of last year, said the report.Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council, told Yahoo Finance that central bank purchases were driven by \"concerns about ongoing inflation, geopolitical tensions, and needs to add diversification to their portfolios.\"The Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle, which began last year, has prompted global inflows into physical-backed gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs).Year-to-date gold is up almost 10% after a meteoric 27% rise in 2024.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

It also faces a cap on its US retail banking assets.Toronto-Dominion, Schwabs biggest shareholder, expects to generate about $14 billion in proceeds through the share sale, Chun told bank employees in an internal memo Monday morning seen by Bloomberg. In just under five years, this investment has generated a very strong return, and we believe this is the right time to reallocate the capital, he said in the memo.A representative for Schwab declined to comment, citing regulatory reasons.Toronto-Dominion acquired its ownership stake in 2020 as part of a transaction to sell its interest in online brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. to Schwab. It sold 40.5 million Schwab shares in August, trimming its previous 12.3% stake to raise about $2.5 billion to help cover the expected cost of fines in the money-laundering probes.If completed, the share sale would be the largest since Boeing Co. raised $24 billion in October through a combination of new shares and mandatory convertible preferred stock.Capital GenerationThe Canadian lender said it plans to use C$8 billion ($5.6 billion) of the proceeds from the sale announced Monday to repurchase its stock, and will invest the balance of the proceeds in the companys businesses. TD Securities and Goldman Sachs are joint bookrunners on the offering.The Schwab sale could reduce Toronto-Dominions net income by about 7%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Paul Gulberg. But TDs plan to repurchase 100 million of its own shares, which represents about 6% of shares outstanding, should cover most of the loss, Gulberg said.We never viewed TDs equity ownership of Schwab as critical for TD and hence, we view this transaction positively for the bank as it frees up capital and resources to be redirected in parts of the business that generate stronger returns and furthers TDs strategy, Royal Bank of Canada analyst Darko Mihelic said.The sale of Schwab shares will not affect Toronto-Dominions long-term agreement with the firm to make sweep-deposit accounts available to Schwab clients. With sweep programs, uninvested cash in brokerage accounts is automatically transferred into higher-interest accounts.--With assistance from Paige Smith.(Updates with share moves, analyst comment, additional details, starting in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of DeclineTrump Promised to Run the Economy Hotter.

He has said \"everything is on the table\" in the strategic review and TD will look at exiting some loan portfolios.In October, TD became the largest bank in U.S. history to plead guilty to violating a federal anti-money laundering law, and agreed to pay more than $3 billion in penalties.\"We believe this will simplify TD's U.S. operations,\" said Jefferies analyst John Aiken.\"Whether this sets TD up for a different strategy in U.S. wealth management will be seen when its strategic review is complete and revealed.\"Analysts estimated TD will free up capital of C$10-12 billion.Like other Canadian banks, TD has generally held strong capital levels, which allowed it to expand in the U.S.It had planned to buy Tennessee-based regional lender First Horizon until shortly before the probe was revealed.(1 Canadian dollar = $0.6976)(Reporting by Manya Saini and Nivedita Balu; Additional reporting by Harshita Meenaktshi; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Krishna Chandra Eluri, Kevin Liffey and Rashmi Aich)"

        "content": "With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, it may be time to exit stage left before the selling picks up.\"Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent,\" Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday.The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components  Meta  has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance.Amazon is the only other Magnificent Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year.Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Magnificent Seven).Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons.For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026.Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts.Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion.The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker.\"There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on todays massive investments,\" says Parker.Valuation on Magnificent Seven stocks  despite their sell-off  also remains a concern for Parker.Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Magnificent Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average.Warns Parker, \"The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern.\"Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia?And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors.\"We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their funds beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years,\" Parker said.One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness.Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Magnificent Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found.With the investment thesis on the Magnificent Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "By Shivansh Tiwary, Medha Singh and Chibuike OguhNEW YORK (Reuters) -Shares of U.S. steel and aluminum producers rose on Monday, while their European and Asian counterparts fell a day after President Donald Trump announced plans to impose fresh metal import tariffs.On Sunday, Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff increase on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. on top of existing duties and a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week. He was expected to unveil the new tariffs on Monday or Tuesday.American producers gained. Cleveland-Cliffs jumped nearly 18%, Nucor added nearly 6%, and Steel Dynamics rose nearly 5%. Century Aluminum added 10%, Alcoa rose 2.2% and U.S. Steel gained nearly 5%.\"It's not surprising that the companies that would directly benefit from this are experiencing market gains right now, that happened last time, although those gains were lost as global market realities eventually catch up with these firms,\" said Christine McDaniel, senior research fellow at Mercatus Center and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Treasury Department.American steelmakers have been grappling with subdued demand for their products as an influx of cheaper imports forced them to cut prices and idle mills.Nearly a quarter of all steel used in the U.S. is imported, with the bulk of it from neighboring Mexico and Canada or close allies in Asia and Europe such as Japan, South Korea and Germany.Steel manufacturers are trying to bring their supply chain closer or into the U.S. to offset the impact of a tariff hike, which Citi Research said would raise import costs by about $150 per ton.\"Tariffs give them a temporary advantage but then you can't really escape the reality of the global marketplace plus U.S. manufacturers who consume steel and aluminum are now facing higher prices,\" McDaniel said.ArcelorMittal, the world's second-largest steelmaker, is planning to build a manufacturing facility in Alabama to supply to the automotive sector, one of the largest buyers of domestically produced steel. South Korea's Hyundai Steel also plans a plant in the U.S.Shares of ArcelorMittal and Voestalpine fell 2% each, while Germany's Thyssenkrupp and Salzgitter were trading flat.Additional tariffs on aluminum imports should boost U.S. domestic production to around 1 million metric tons a year from nearly 750,000 metric tons, J.P.Morgan analysts said, similar to the rise seen during the 2018 tariff war.Shares of Asian steel producers also fell, with India's Tata Steel down 3.2% and JSW Steel down 2.3%.The U.S. will still depend heavily on imports to meet its annual aluminum demand of about 5 million metric tons. The metal is widely used in the aerospace sector, which has been grappling with supply chain challenges.In his first term, Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.\"The higher tariffs at that time were associated with the higher producer prices and raising the input cost, and it did also save some jobs in steel and aluminum but it cost a lot more jobs in the downstream sectors,\" McDaniel added.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh, Christoph Steitz, Paolo Laudani, Isabel Demetz, Medha Singh, Shivansh Tiwary and Aatreyee Dasgupta; Editing by David Goodman, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Arun Koyyur and David Gregorio)"

It also has around 1 trillion yen ($6.58 billion) of bonds maturing in the next two years, or around 43% of its total outstanding bonds, LSEG data showed.Nissan has been hit harder than others by the EV shift having never fully recovered from years of crisis sparked by the 2018 removal and arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn.Its market capitalisation is now five times smaller than that of Honda, which is about 7.6 trillion yen. A decade ago, the pair were both worth around 4.6 trillion yen.Nissan's share price has fallen nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Last year, it fell below 400 yen - the price French partner Renault valued the stock at to increase its stake in the Japanese automaker in 2002.The price recovered in December after Nissan and Honda announced tie-up talks and was at 443 yen on Monday.($1 = 151.9900 yen)(Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- If it were like most companies on the losing end of a boom and bust cycle, Schwazze could just turn to the US bankruptcy court to keep its creditors at bay while renegotiating its debt. But unlike most businesses, its product  marijuana  is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government.Most Read from BloombergSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterNice Airport, If You Can Get to It: No Subway, No Highway, No BridgeSin puente y sin metro: el nuevo aeropuerto de Lima es una debacleThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleIn New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay SuperThat disadvantage will make it harder for Schwazze and other cannabis companies to win concessions from lenders just as a wave of debt that the industry borrowed in recent years to expand in states where weed is legal comes due. The biggest companies, those that operate in more than one state, have as much as $6 billion in debt maturing next year, according to Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, which specializes in the cannabis market.The reckoning comes as the industry has failed to turn legal weed into reliable profits. In 2022 more than 42% of dealers reported making a profit, according to a survey by Whitney. By last year, the number had dropped to about 27%. Some who cant consolidate will fail and go out of business. Many will be forced to refinance their debt at higher interest rates and onerous contractual covenants.There is a huge debt bubble that could have a significantly negative impact on the cannabis industry if not addressed, Whitney said. Refinancing this cycle will be at much higher interest rates and the businesses will not have the cash flow to manage it.Colorado-based Schwazze has hired advisers to help it figure out how to restructure debt it took on while opening a chain of dispensaries in two states, according to people familiar with the situation. Its been able to push back the due date on some of its loans but it needs more cash, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. However, the workout needs to take place out-of-court because of the federal prohibition.Nearly half of US states have legalized marijuana, while a number of others have decriminalized the drug or allow it for medicinal purposes. It remains fully illegal in just four states. About 79% of the US population lives in a county that has at least one dispensary, according to the Pew Research Center. Legal cannabis companies employed more than 450,000 people and sold more than $30 billion in product last year, Whitney said.Federal law bars people from moving marijuana across state lines and treats it as a dangerous, Schedule I drug. Prosecutors generally do not take action against individual consumers, but the laws still limit banking services for the cannabis industry. And the US Trustee, the federal watchdog for the US bankruptcy system, has successfully blocked companies from filing for Chapter 11 protection.Schwazze, whose formal name is Medicine Man Technologies Inc., has engaged Oppenheimer & Co. and Goodwin Procter as legal counsel for its talks, said the people. A group of the companys creditors is working with Paul Hastings, they added.The negotiations come as Schwazze received a default notice in December due to delays in its audited financial reports, according to public disclosures. The company had to switch independent auditors and restate annual results for 2022 and 2023 following the discovery of accounting errors. In July, Schwazze was able to push back the maturity on a $15 million loan with Altmore Capital and a $17 million promissory note with Reynold Greenleaf & Associates that were due this month, according to public disclosures.Among its options, Schwazze is looking to get incremental capital and may seek a potential below-par exchange, which could result in a dilution of equity, the people said.It has been this way for years, said industry lawyer Hilary Bricken with the Husch Blackwell law firm. These lenders have the upper hand. The terms given to cannabis companies are onerous and draconian. It is not a friendly environment.Last year, the US Department of Justice started the process of classifying marijuana as a Schedule III, less dangerous substance, one of the industrys primary goals because it would allow cannabis companies to deduct normal business expenses and push hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses into profitability, said Aaron Smith, co-founder of the National Cannabis Industry Association.President Donald Trumps incoming Attorney General, Pam Bondi, declined to say during her confirmation hearing last month whether she would cancel that process. The industry has been working for years to remove as many federal hurdles as possible, with limited success, despite the majority of Americans favoring legalization.Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana about a dozen years ago, launching a wave of small starts ups run by enthusiastic, but inexperienced, entrepreneurs. As more states legalized, either for recreational use or as medicine, investors piled in and the number of licensed dealers and dispensaries exploded. Overall sales grew steadily, with a revenue boost hitting when the pandemic ended. Thats when companies loaded up on the debt that is coming due next year.Today the market has matured with savvier, more professional operators pushing out the mom-and-pop startups, said Bricken, the marijuana lawyer who has been advising clients since the early days of legalization. There are only a handful of lenders left who are willing to invest in the industry, Bricken said, citing two of the biggest, Chicago Atlantic Group Inc. and Altmore Capital Investment Management.All of the stupid money has left the space, she said.Representatives for Chicago Atlantic did not return a request for comment. Altmore Capital declined to comment. Messages left with Schwazze, as well as with Oppenheimer, Goodwin Procter and Paul Hastings were not returned.Cannabis companies have struggled to compete with unlicensed dealers, who can undercut legal sales because they dont pay for a license, comply with regulations or face any taxes said. The US saw about $44 billion in illegal sales last year, according to cannabis market tracker BDSA.Unless there is federal intervention, through reform, then the industry is on the precipice of collapse and large firms from outside the cannabis industry will be positioned to take over, for pennies on the dollar, Whitney said.--With assistance from Fiona Rutherford.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of DeclineTrump Promised to Run the Economy Hotter.

        "content": "By Deborah Mary Sophia(Reuters) - Heather Perry made a bold bet before last year's holiday rush: switch all e-commerce operations of her family-owned roastery, Klatch Coffee, to Shopify.The 42-year-old small business CEO from Southern California was drawn to the Canadian company's artificial intelligence-based services that automate routine tasks such as generating discounts and product descriptions, its improved customization tools and a broader suite of apps.\"Running the business from scratch during the holiday season? I can't even imagine,\" Perry, who migrated to Shopify in July, told Reuters.\"Shopify allows us to make really quick changes. Honestly, I can't imagine doing it manually.\" She declined to name the platform she was on before making the shift.Perry is among hundreds of merchants in North America who have migrated to Shopify to build online stores and manage retail businesses, according to data from internet analytics firm BuiltWith and Reuters interviews with a dozen sellers.The company's AI suite, \"Shopify Magic\", is reshaping the e-commerce landscape by equipping small businesses with automation tools once exclusive to retail giants, fueling growth in a challenging retail environment.Shopify generates revenue largely from subscription fees and cuts on transactions on the platform. Its revenue is expected to jump 27.3%  the fastest growth in six quarters  when the company reports its holiday quarter results on Tuesday, according to data compiled by LSEG.The growth is also faster than that of the industry. Global e-commerce sales are estimated to have risen 8.4% to $6.091 trillion in 2024, according to forecasts from eMarketer. In comparison, Shopify's revenue is expected to have climbed 24.6% during the same period, according to LSEG.The move is also putting Shopify on a firmer footing after a post-pandemic slowdown. Revenue had soared more than 90% for four straight quarters during the COVID-19 lockdowns as homebound consumers flocked to online shopping. Growth sputtered as restrictions eased.Now, the store count is climbing again. BuiltWith data shows the number of stores registered on Shopify increased by 20% in the July-September quarter, a crucial period of planning for businesses.Shopify is \"attracting a large volume of sellers\" at a pace approaching COVID-era growth rates, said Ken Wong, an analyst with Oppenheimer.'GAME-CHANGER'The company's subscription plans range from $39 per month for a basic package to $2,000 for the enterprise-focused Shopify Plus. All plans come with some \"Shopify Magic\" features that automate tasks such as generating images, writing product descriptions, tracking sales and setting up discounts.\"From day one, we used Shopify's AI personalization. It's a game-changer,\" said Jackson Mlawer, product management director at Daily Harvest, an organic meal and snack brand that launched on Shopify in July.AI tools have helped the team save more than 20 hours a month on testing and cut packaging sizes for 15% of orders, Daily Harvest said. They also boosted page views by 40%, the company added.About 50% of the merchants the company surveyed intended to use AI tools for content generation, while 33% planned to apply them in marketing, boosting website visibility and customer targeting, it said in September.\"By introducing AI features, Shopify is giving these merchants, who are usually small, tools that are very sophisticated,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.FULL CONTROLA major pull for merchants is the consolidation of services, including inventory management, shipping, payments and taxes, on the platform.\"Shopify's core customer base ... is just not the most tech-savvy,\" Wong said. \"The more capabilities Shopify can present on a single stack just makes it extremely simplistic for a non-tech-oriented user.\"At least seven merchants said they first launched on smaller rivals but switched due to technical challenges.Shopify's streamlined setup, enhanced tools to help boost website visibility and e-commerce-focused templates give it an edge, according to the merchants.\"I started on another platform and kept hitting roadblocks,\" said Jill Dobson, owner of leather goods brand Jill's Homestead in Iowa. \"So, I migrated to Shopify in spring 2020.\"Shopify's payment processing simplified operations for her small team by replacing a patchwork of external payment apps. She has also cut costs, replacing a $250 monthly professional photoshoot with AI-generated images.Still, the investments in new technology and features have turned the spotlight on margin growth.After more than doubling its profit through most of 2023, Shopify posted a 45% rise to $459 million in the July-September quarter. Analysts expect profit to slow further in the fourth quarter, rising just 28%.Shopify's payment partnerships with companies such as PayPal pose a risk, analysts have said, as they could generate lower transaction fees.\"You can only trend up by that magnitude for so long. There's definitely a flattening and so there's definitely going to be a little investor anxiety that we're somewhat capped on margins,\" Wong said.(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Sriraj Kalluvila)"

        "content": "For more than two years, optimists have firmly held the reins on Wall Street. Since 2022 came to a close, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), widely followed S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-propelled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have respectively increased in value by 35%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Feb. 13.Investors have relied on a laundry list of catalysts to send the broader market higher, such as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and excitement surrounding stock splits. But the wind in Wall Street's sails in recent months has to do with President Donald Trump's return to the White House.During Trump's first term in office, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite catapulted higher by 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively. It's fair to say that Trump's focus on lowering the peak marginal corporate income tax rate and promoting deregulation are being viewed favorably by Wall Street.But while investors are eager for a repeat performance of Trump's first term in office, more than a century of data suggests the president is on a collision course with history.When Trump was inaugurated four weeks ago, he took over an incredibly resilient economy. Despite the longest yield-curve inversion in history and the first meaningful decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression  two indicators that would typically foreshadow a recession  the U.S. economy has continued to chug along.Although Trump's sweeping proposal to further reduce the corporate income tax for businesses manufacturing their goods domestically may be a positive for the stock market and U.S. economy, it's hard to overlook the correlation between recessions and Republican presidents.Since Woodrow Wilson became president in March 1913, there have been 10 Republicans in the Oval Office and nine Democratic presidents. Out of these nine Democrats, four didn't oversee a recession that began during their stint in the White House (e.g., Barack Obama inherited a recession that began under George W. Bush).In comparison, all 10 Republican presidents had an economic recession occur during their tenure. While these recessions aren't necessarily tied to GOP policy proposals (e.g., the COVID-19 recession had nothing to do with policies during Trump's first term in office), this correlation is more than a century old.Though the U.S. economy and stock market aren't mirror images of each other, weakness in the U.S. economy would be expected to adversely impact corporate earnings. Based on an analysis from Bank of America Global Research from 1927 through March 2023, approximately two-thirds of the peak-to-trough drawdowns in the benchmark S&P 500 occurred after a recession was declared. In other words, history repeating itself during Trump's second term would spell trouble for stocks.However, GOP presidencies and U.S. recessions going hand in hand isn't the only correlation that's worrisome under Trump. When he took office four weeks ago, he inherited one of the priciest stock markets in history.Most investors tend to rely on the time-tested price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to determine if a stock or the broader market are relatively cheap or pricey. The P/E ratio is arrived at by dividing a company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share. This method works great for mature businesses, but high-growth stocks and recessions can make it less useful.The S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio, is arguably a much better valuation tool and is capable of providing apples-to-apples comparisons over long periods. The Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years.As of the closing bell on Feb. 13, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E stood at 38.54, which is just shy of the closing high of 38.89 during the current bull market. This is more than double the average reading of 17.21, when back-tested to the start of 1871, and the third-highest reading during a continuous bull market spanning 154 years.While there are reasons investors have been willing to tolerate premium valuations, such as the rise of AI and ease of access to information and online trading, more than 150 years of valuation data suggests the stock market is in trouble.There have only been six instances where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E has surpassed 30 throughout history, including the present, and the previous five were eventually followed by steep losses of 20% to 89% for the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite.Based on the clear picture history paints, there's a strong likelihood of a recession and sizable stock market decline during Trump's second term. Thankfully, history is a pendulum that swings in both directions  and often disproportionately.Even though 112 years of data strongly correlates to recessions occurring during GOP presidencies, it's important to note that recessions are historically short-lived. Since the end of World War II in September 1945, there have been a dozen recessions, which have lasted an average of 10 months. On the other end of the spectrum, periods of economic expansion have endured for roughly five years. Investors who wager on the U.S. economy to expand should be handsomely rewarded.It's a similar story when examining the length of bull and bear markets on Wall Street.In June 2023, Bespoke Investment Group published a dataset on X that calculated the calendar-day length of every bull and bear market for the benchmark S&P 500, dating back to the start of the Great Depression. Whereas the average bear market resolved in 286 calendar days, the typical bull market rally stuck around for 3.5 times as long (1,011 calendar days).The nonlinearity of investing cycles is even more apparent in a dataset updated annually by Crestmont Research.The analysts at Crestmont calculated the rolling 20-year total returns (including dividends paid) for the S&P 500 dating back to 1900. Even though the S&P didn't exist until 1923, analysts were able to locate its components in other indexes to back-test total return data from 1900 to 1923.Crestmont's dataset resulted in 106 rolling 20-year periods, with ending years ranging from 1919 to 2024. Most importantly, all 106 time frames generated a positive annualized total return. If an investor had, hypothetically, purchased an index that tracked the S&P 500 at any point since 1900 and simply held that position for 20 years, they would have made money 100% of the time.Although historic precedent and correlations can sometimes be scary, history has conclusively shown that time is investors' greatest ally.Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and S&P 500 Index wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Moderna has reported revenue of $1bn for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 - a sharp decline from the $2.8bn recorded in the same quarter in 2023.The drop was largely attributed to the earlier launch of the updated vaccine for Covid-19 in the US, which resulted in a shift in sales to the third quarter.For Q4 2024, Moderna's net product sales were $938m - a 66% year-over-year decrease.Research and development expenses for the period fell by 20% to $1.1bn, driven by lower expenses in various vaccine programmes, partially offset by more spending on norovirus and individualised neoantigen therapy (INT)..For the full year 2024, total revenue stood at $3.2bn, a decrease from $6.8bn in 2023, mainly due to lower Covid-19 vaccine sales.The company reported net product sales of $3.1bn for the year, a 53% decrease from 2023. During the third quarter (Q3), it also commenced sales of its RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] vaccine, generating revenue of $25m for the year.The full-year cost of sales was $1.5bn, or 47% of net product sales, a decrease from $4.7bn in 2023.Net loss for 2024 was $3.6bn, compared to a $4.7bn loss reported in 2023.Looking ahead to 2025, Moderna expects revenue of $1.5bn to $2.5bn, with the cost of sales expected to be around $1.2bn.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel stated: We have made progress in 2024 across our late-stage pipeline and cost reduction efforts. Our team successfully filed three biologics licence applications in the final months of the year and reduced our costs by 27% compared to 2023.In 2025, we remain focused on driving sales, delivering up to 10 product approvals through 2027, and expanding cost efficiencies across our business.By the end of 2025, we aim to remove nearly $1bn in costs. With strong momentum in our late-stage pipeline, we anticipate multiple approvals starting this year, along with key Phase III readouts that will support our long-term growth.In November 2024, Moderna secured approval from Health Canada for its respiratory syncytial virus messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine mRESVIA.\"Moderna reports decline in Q4 2024 revenue \" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra, Aditi Shah and Nikunj OhriNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's demand for back taxes running into a record $1.4 billion from Volkswagen, after 12 years of scrutiny, is reigniting concerns that lengthy investigations and litigation could sour the plans of foreign firms in the fastest-growing major economy.Automakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Honda and Toyota face demands for about $6 billion collectively in disputes on income-tax, customs and other payments that go back years, a Reuters analysis shows.Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been courting foreign investors with promises to simplify regulations and uproot bureaucratic hurdles, lengthy tax investigations remain a sore point, often triggering lawsuits that stretch over years.In one high-profile incident, telecoms company Vodafone won its case against a $2-billion retrospective Indian tax demand after more than a decade of legal battles with New Delhi, including international arbitration at the Hague.Now, Volkswagen's move on January 29 to sue India for $1.4 billion in tax that the firm called \"impossibly enormous\" is making foreign companies jittery.Tax advisers and lawyers say they are fielding nervous queries from clients about how years-old tax cases could come back to haunt them.Calls are also growing for an amnesty scheme for cases running for years, as India set a three-year window on February 1 to conclude reviews of customs shipments, but the rule excludes old disputes running into billions of dollars.\"The government clearly recognised this now and redressed it, but it is unlikely old tax demand notices will be given any benefit,\" said Ameya Dadhich, a tax associate at global law firm DLA Piper.\"Such instances can deter foreign companies from investing heavily in India,\" he added. \"An amnesty scheme will be helpful given that around 40,000 tariff disputes are pending.\"India's finance ministry did not respond to queries from Reuters.Modi wants to turn India into a manufacturing hub, but many electronic and auto companies rely on assembly operations using parts for high-end cars or smartphones imported from markets such as China and Europe, often spurring investigations.Government data shows total pending arrears of service tax, customs and excise levies stood at nearly $53 billion in November 2024, with a whopping 70% disputed in litigation.In the category of import tariff, or customs disputes alone, India had made tax demands of $4.5 billion by March 2024, with a third of those pending for more than five years.One tax adviser and a lawyer for a foreign automaker in India said the Volkswagen news sparked a flurry of calls from companies to gather updates on scrutiny of their shipments, to ensure their imports are classified correctly for tax.TAX BACKLOGIn a move seen as aimed at placating U.S. President Donald Trump, who once called India a \"tariff king\", New Delhi cut average tariffs on February 1 to 11% from 13%, though they still exceed those of China, Japan and the United States.Imports of fully built luxury cars face Indian taxes and levies of about 100%, while the rate is 150% for Scotch whisky and wine.In the highly competitive auto sector, Volkswagen is not alone in facing tax scrutiny.Maruti has $2.4 billion of tax demands in dispute, with at least one case concerning transactions from 1986. Volkswagen is locked in tussles over $1.2 billion, apart from the most recent demand, while Hyundai faces $488 million in such demands.India's appeals tribunal for customs, excise and service tax faced a backlog of 80,000 cases, Sanjay Malhotra, then the revenue secretary, said in 2023. With about 20,000 new cases each year, he said, \"We are not able to reduce the backlog.\"In the case of Volkswagen, New Delhi accuses it of having imported most parts of 14 models in separate shipments before assembling them locally, paying tax ranging from 5% to 15%.That strategy circumvented the tax of 30% to 35% payable if the same items were imported in a single shipment as a completely knocked down (CKD) unit.In its court filing to be heard this month in the financial capital of Mumbai, Volkswagen is blaming Indian officials for their \"inaction and tardiness\" in taking years to review shipment records, some stretching back to 2012.Had New Delhi wrapped up its reviews earlier, Volkswagen says, it could have challenged the move or re-evaluated its import strategy, but the tax notice now puts \"at peril the very foundation of faith and trust\" foreign investors desire.Two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the slowness of Indian bureaucracy and a lack of adequate documentation from Volkswagen both contributed to the delay.\"Long pendency like in Volkswagen's case has a detrimental effect on business,\" said Shashi Mathews, head of indirect tax practice at Indian law firm, IndusLaw.\"We are seeing an increase in queries from clients wanting to know the fate of their shipment reviews.\"(Reporting by Aditi Shah, Nikunj Ohri and Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Arpan Chaturvedi; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"

The stock soared earlier this week on a strong earnings report, which was driven by a surge in retail trading activity in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.But while the data shows activity is high and sentiment is bullish, there are still cautious traders to be found among the retail cohort.Ben Hunt, a recently retired digital marketer from Pikeville, Kentucky, said he's been slowly taking money out of the stock market since Trump's election win.\"I've been a seller for the past three months,\" Hunt said. \"Long term, I'm bullish forever, but over the next few quarters or even a year to 18 months, I'm being a little more cautious.\"Hunt said his portfolio is about 30% cash, and he plans to increase that to about 50% by the end of March.He said he was able to retire at 46 thanks in part to gains in his stock portfolio, and his hesitation to be all in on the stock market right now is due to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's agenda.Ideally, Hunt said he would redeploy the cash after a market sell-off, but he'll jump right back into the stock market if he is wrong.\"To be a good investor, you have to have perspective, and sometimes your thesis is wrong and you have to be able to adapt,\" Hunt said. \"I'm willing to buy higher and sell higher after that.\"William Mangum, a 26-year-old supply chain manager from Columbia, South Carolina, first entered the trading world in 2021.\"I had no idea what I was doing. It was right around the time the whole GameStop debacle happened,\" Mangum said. \"I've been trying to figure out everything since then.\"After a couple of years of trial and error, Mangum said things have started to \"click\" in his trading, which has seen an increase in activity since he secured full-time employment in 2024.In 2025, Mangum said he's scouring the market for opportunities away from the most crowded trades. He views mega-cap tech companies as \"priced for perfection\" and expects them to underperform the broader market for the year.\"I think small caps are the way to go this year,\" Mangum said. His main strategy is to look for companies that are trading below their IPO price and are on the verge of profitability.Stocks on his radar include Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, and BlackBerry.With the recent surge in pandemic-era darlings like Palantir and Robinhood, there seems to be a flavor of speculation in the markets that is reminiscent of the post-COVID boom times, when retail traders were highly active before the crushing 2022 bear market.But that's not necessarily a signal to sell, Hunt said.\"I don't think we've reached the point of a blow-off top or complete exuberance just yet. There's still quite a bit of pessimism and fear out there, and I call that keeping the porridge just right. I feel like we're still sort of in that sweet spot,\" Hunt said.Recent sentiment data aligns with Hunt's thinking. The CNN Fear And Greed Indicator is ping-ponging between the \"Fear\" and \"Neutral\" zones. The most recent AAII Investor Sentiment Survey showed a 52-week high in bearish responses, and sentiment for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 is in \"Extremely Bearish\" territory, according to data from Stocktwits.Richardson, who's noticed a jump in online chatter among retail traders, had some advice for his peers.\"Retail has to remember, things go up fast and they go down fast. Take your profits and don't be greedy,\" he said.Read the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "By Savyata Mishra(Reuters) -McDonald's posted on Monday a surprise increase in its global comparable sales in the fourth quarter, aided by demand for its cheaper items and discounted offerings from diners in the Middle East, Japan and China.Shares of the burger chain rose nearly 5% in early U.S. trading, despite a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. comparable sales due to an E. coli outbreak in late October, and cautious spending.Demand pressure on fast-food chains operating in the Middle East has begun to ease after widespread informal boycotts of Western chains over their perceived pro-Israeli stance in the Gaza conflict.The surprising sales growth in the region for McDonald's offsets some weakness in its largest market, the U.S., where it reported the biggest drop, 1.4%, since the pandemic.KFC parent Yum Brands last week recorded positive sales growth in the Middle East.McDonald's and its rivals leaned on value meals in 2024 to spur spending among customers preferring to eat meals at home.\"Value is helping McDonald's recover traffic from lower-income consumers, but that expansion of value will pressure store profits, which will make it difficult to drive stronger earnings longer-term,\" Northcoast Research analyst Jim Sanderson said.McDonald's extended its $5 meal deal launched in June into December. CEO Chris Kempczinski said the meal was prompting U.S. diners to buy more, and that the average transaction size for the meal deal was more than $10 in the United States.DISCOUNT PUSH CONTINUESExecutives on a call with analysts did not give any timeline for ending the company's discount push and said the fast-food industry overall still faces challenges with low-income consumers. Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden said the company had limited pricing flexibility.Budget-conscious diners were also targeted in October with a new Chicken Big Mac, along with other special releases. The company announced in December it would bring back its snack wrap, another chicken-based option aimed at budget-conscious diners.U.S. customer traffic increased slightly in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, the company said, but that was offset by a smaller average amount spent by customers per visit.Customer visits were also limited by an E. coli outbreak in October, which forced McDonald's to temporarily suspend sales of its Quarter Pounder hamburgers in a fifth of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants for roughly two weeks. Kempczinski said the episode is still having an effect in the region where the outbreak occurred, but not elsewhere, and expects even that localized effect to subside by the end of April.The company's global same-store sales rose 0.4% in the quarter ending December 31, compared with expectations of a 0.63% decline, according to data compiled by LSEG.This was driven by a 4.1% rise in McDonald's business segment where restaurants are operated by local partners, led by Middle East and Japan. Company executives said in a post-earnings call that demand was stabilizing in China.Executives said the chain was on track to have 50,000 units worldwide by the end of 2027.Quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 were in line with market expectations.(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru and Waylon Cunningham in New York; Editing by Sam Holmes, Arun Koyyur and Rod Nickel)"

        "content": "Stocks ended the first week of February little changed as investors digested corporate earnings from Big Tech companies, a hotter-than-expected January jobs report, and continuing updates on President Donald Trump's tariff policies.For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%.In the week ahead, inflation will take center stage, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set for release on Wednesday morning. Updates on wholesale inflation and retail sales will also be closely tracked.But investors will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's planned announcement of new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as for more details on reciprocal duties across the board.On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies, including McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB), are set to report earnings.The January jobs report released on Friday showed continued signs of resilience in the labor market as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher to show the US labor market exited 2024 on an even better footing than previously reported.This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon. And if anything, it puts more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs.\"The more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note on Friday. \"This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate.\"Stocks rebounded after dropping initially on Monday as President Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed at least a month. But what exactly happens with tariffs remains an overhang on markets as investors debate the potential impact on inflation and, subsequently, monetary policy.On Sunday, Trump said he will introduce a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US from all countries. He told reporters on Air Force One that he will announce the new metals duties on Monday, but didn't say when they would be implemented. The move puts Canada and Mexico, both top US suppliers of steel and aluminum, back in the hot seat on tariffs.Also stepping up the trade pressure, Trump said on Friday he would announce a plan on reciprocal tariffs on American imports. The comments were made during a meeting with Japans Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said tariffs on Japan were an option.In a research note on Friday, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer Rick Rieder said it would likely take two weak jobs reports to prompt discussion about the Fed resuming its interest rate cutting cycle. But he added that the risks surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs and an immigration crackdown, muddle the outlook.\"While we and the Fed are keeping our eyes focused on these payroll (and inflation) reports, we also have to closely watch the news flow, and then the reverberations around these events, to get a sense for when the Fed and market makers can feel confident in rates coming down closer to a long-run neutral level,\" Rieder wrote.With investors' focus now squarely back on inflation data for hints of interest rate cuts, a fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday.Wall Street economists expect January's CPI to show headline inflation of 2.9% in January, flat from the month prior. Prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, below the 0.4% increase seen in December.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior.The first monthly retail sales report of 2025 is set for release on Friday. Economists estimate retail sales were flat over the prior month during January. But the control group of retail sales  which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP)  is also expected to have risen by 0.4%, down from the 0.7% increase seen in December.With more than 62% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the year-over-year growth rate for the index keeps moving higher. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was pacing for earnings growth of 16.4% compared to the year prior. This would mark the fastest pace of growth in three years and is well above the 11.8% earnings growth analysts had expected at the start of January.While earnings have been beating expectations, macro factors have continued to create stop-and-go market action as stocks have failed to find clear direction. On Friday, stocks slipped lower after the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed respondents' one-year inflation expectations hit their highest level since November 2023. One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking the the fifth time in 14 years that the survey reported a rise of 1 percentage point or more in year-ahead inflation expectations.The release noted that the jump in inflation expectations was \"in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy.\"Stocks reversed course on the news, with all three major averages flipping from green to red. And while that constitutes just a small sampling of the market action, it's a reminder that what tariffs mean for inflation is squarely in focus for markets ahead of a week that's expected to provide updates on both fronts.Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, January (3% previously)Earnings: McDonald's (MCD), Monday.com (MNDY)Economic data: NFIB small business optimism, January (104.7 expected, 105.1 prior)Earnings: BP (BP), Coca-Cola (KO), DoorDash (DASH), Humana (HUM), Lyft (LYFT), Marriott International (MAR), Shopify (SHOP), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Upstart (UPST), Zillow Group (Z)WednesdayEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month over month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.4% previously); Core CPI, month over month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); CPI, year over year, January (+2.9% expected, +2.9% previously); Core CPI, year over year, January (+3.1% expected, +3.2% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year over year, January (+0.7% previously); MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Feb. 7 (+2.2% previously)Earnings: Albermarle (ALB), Biogen (BIIB), CVS Health (CVS), Cisco (CSCO), Dutch Bros (BROS), Generac (GNRC), Kraft Heinz (KHC), MGM Resorts (MGM), Reddit (RDDT), Robinhood (HOOD), The TradeDesk (TTD)Economic data: Producer Price Index, month over month, January (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); PPI, year over year, January (+3.2% expected, +3.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ending Feb. 8 (219,000 previously);Earnings: Airbnb (ABNB), Applied Materials (AMAT), Coinbase (COIN), Crocs (CROX), Datadog (DDOG), Duke Energy (DUK), DraftKings (DKNG), John Deere (DE), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Roku (ROKU), Sony (SONY), Twilio (TWLO), Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Economic data: Retail sales, month over month, January (+0% expected, +0.4% previously); Retail sales ex-auto and gas, January (+0.3% previously); Import price index, month over month, January (+0.4% expected, +0.1% prior); Export prices, month over month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); Industrial production month over month, January (+0.3% expected, +0.9% prior)Earnings: Moderna (MRNA)Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

In the banking industry, he accused the largest U.S. lenders of shutting down accounts of conservative customers, and dismantled a consumer financial watchdog over the weekend.More broadly, the administration is going to run a more \"growth-oriented agenda,\" but the ultimate direction of its policies is more complicated, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told a Miami conference on Tuesday.\"The regulatory environment should be a constructive tailwind, but the broad policy landscape is still uncertain,\" he said. \"There's a lot of policy that is shifting, and until we have more certainty on that policy, that's going to create a little bit of volatility,\" he said, citing immigration, tax, energy, trade and fiscal policy.Markets will likely have \"stops and starts\" that are beneficial for Goldman's trading business, he said. Monday's trading was relatively normal after the two previous weeks started with \"exciting and interesting\" activity as the administration announced a flurry of executive orders and sanctions.Wells Fargo's finance chief Mike Santomassimo told the same conference that clients are optimistic about the economic outlook, and considering mergers and other activities.\"There's certainly this optimism that the administration is going to be much more pro-growth, pro-business, remove a lot of the obstacles that may get in the way of growing the economy,\" he said.\"There's still some uncertainty in terms of where a lot of the policy may go,\" that is causing clients to be cautious about striking deals, but \"we still expect to see that momentum,\" Santomassimo said.Keycorp CEO Chris Gorman said clients are upbeat despite the uncertainty created by new import tariffs. He cited a poll among the bank's clients that showed 62% expect to work on strategic M&A over the next year.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar, Nupur Anand and Tatiana Bautzer in New York, Niket Nishant and Manya Saini in Bengaluru, editing by Lananh Nguyen, Alexandra Hudson)"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors are getting creative in the way they bet on the diverging path for interest rates across major economies as they look for ways to sidestep volatility in the dollar, using European currencies instead to fund bets on the Japanese yen.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayDollar-based strategies are being tested by the uncertainty Donald Trumps trade tariff plans have unleashed on markets. Investors are questioning whether the US presidents proposals will prove a bullish driver for the greenback, or turn out to be more of a negotiating tactic.As an alternative way of wagering on yen strength, some firms are using strategies involving European currencies, rather than the dollar, to profit from a widening rate differential with Japan.Vanguard Asset Management, Russell Investments, RBC BlueBay Asset Management and Candriam SA are among those favoring a variety of trades reflecting this theme, such as shorting the euro, the Swiss franc and the pound against the yen. Thats because they are viewed as offering bigger returns and as safer than betting against an increasingly unpredictable dollar.One way of playing the yen trade without necessarily having the dollar risk is to put it on versus the crosses, said Adrian Boehler, global head of macro distribution at UBS Group AG. People are opting to express a higher conviction trade around the yen without the headline risk associated with Trump by steering clear of straight dollar/yen.After roughly half a decade of broad weakness, the yen finally appears ready to change its reputation as a low-yielding currency. The Bank of Japan has flagged that it will keep raising interest rates from 0.5%, acknowledging that Japan is no longer in deflation.Investors are particularly keen to back the yen against currencies in Europe, given that many countries in the region face the prospect of aggressive rate cuts to support their economies, just as the BOJ is poised to tighten further.Traders see the European Central Bank making at least three more quarter-point rate cuts this year, compared to just one from the Federal Reserve, a pattern likely to weaken the euro. Meanwhile in Japan, signs of increasing wage growth have bolstered expectations that the BOJ will raise rates at least once more in 2025.That set-up has propelled the yen roughly 2% higher against the Swiss franc, sterling and the euro since January. Its the best start to the year for the yen against the Swiss and UK currencies since 2017.There is downward pressure on the euro against the yen from both economic and political standpoints, said Juntaro Morimoto, senior analyst at Sony Financial Group Inc. in Tokyo.Because of this, Citigroup Inc., Rabobank and Danske Bank A/S all see the euro ending the year below 150 yen compared with 160 yen at the moment, with the latter forecasting a 12% drop to 141 yen.Signals in the options market have pointed to flagging sentiment toward European currencies versus the yen since the year began. So-called risk reversals for the Swiss franc against the yen are near the most bearish levels in two months and traders cite growing demand among investors to protect against a drop to 160 yen. That would be a decline of 6% from current levels around 169 yen and a level last seen almost two years ago, as Switzerland faces a possible return to negative interest rates.As the same time, volatility in the euro-yen pair has remained relatively subdued since the start of the year, compared with euro-dollar volatility. The spread between the two has been broadly narrowing since the run-up to last years US election, when options markets began to reflect tariff risk premiums, largely in dollar crosses.Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at Bluebay, said he was buying the Japanese currency versus the euro and the pound as a way to bet on a strong yen while cutting through the US tariff noise.Ales Koutny, head of international rates at Vanguard Asset Management, said he began buying the Japanese currency against the franc in December, alongside the euro and the South Korean won. The yen used to be one of our favorite shorts, he said. It has now become one of our preferred longs.--With assistance from Masahiro Hidaka and Vassilis Karamanis.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "(.)A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanHyperactive U.S. policy moves appear to have frozen macro markets this week, with Wednesday's key U.S. inflation release set to hold Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell's benign take on economy up to the light.Powell basically told Congress on Tuesday that the economy was fine and that Fed policy was sufficiently well calibrated to deal to with uncertainties surrounding the new government plans - credit is still 'restrictive' while they wait and see.\"We are in a pretty good place,\" Powell told the Senate committee - citing tariffs, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policy as the key variables the Fed will \"try to make sense of\".January's consumer price inflation report might not contain many clues about the year ahead, but it will cement views on the starting point. Headline inflation is expected to remain just below 3%, with the annual core rate slipping to 3.1%, and Powell gets a chance to comment on the number as he reprises his testimony to the House Financial Services committee later.But with another sweep of Washington moves overnight on everything from reciprocal trade tariffs to cutting Federal workers, financial markets also appear to have reverted to a 'wait and see' mode.The S&P500 closed flat on Tuesday, about 1% shy of last month's record high, and index futures showed little movement overnight either.The fourth-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season provides a pretty serene backdrop, tracking circa 15% annual profit for S&P500 overall, and recent turbulence in the bond market has subsided too.Worries about investor demand for sovereign debt have been assuaged in recent weeks, with $58 billion of 3-year Treasury notes flying off the shelf yesterday and $42 billion of 10-year paper up for grabs later on Wednesday.Syndicated government debt sales in Britain and Italy this week have been more than 10 times oversubscribed.An irksome energy pop did rattle bonds earlier this week, but that too has reversed on Wednesday. U.S. crude ebbed - clocking year-on-year losses of 5% - as industry data out later is expected to show an increase in stockpiles. The Energy Information Administration, meantime, lifted estimates for U.S. crude production while leaving its demand forecast unchanged.Ten-year Treasury yields hovered just above 4.5% awaiting today's inflation update and auction.With tariffs and threats of them flying daily from Washington and retaliatory moves in the works, even currency markets previously so sensitive to the import duties have settled down considerably.The dollar index, the pivotal euro/dollar exchange rate and even China's yuan seem stuck in the middle of recent trading ranges. So too are Mexico's peso and Canada's dollar.Part of the reason for the cageyness is the gap between signal and effect - wariness about whether what has been announced or threatened will actually take effect and to what degree tit-for-tat moves cancel out macro impacts.One currency mover overnight was Japan's yen, which slipped as investors grew wary of U.S. steel and auto tariffs despite the meeting between President Donald Trump and Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week.Japan's industry minister Yoji Muto said on Wednesday the nation has requested the United States exempt Japan from the proposed steel and aluminium tariffs.Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, meantime, said the central bank warned of the risks food price rises may start to affect people's inflation expectations.In Europe, attention was turning to this month's elections in Germany but European shares and Germany's DAX benchmark continued to plow ahead to new records.With the earnings season underway there too, Heineken led the pack on Wednesday and jumped 12% to its highest since 2023. The brewer reported better-than-expected profit, launched a share buyback and forecasts further growth in operating profit of between 4% and 8% in 2025 - lifting other brewers and beverage firms in the slipstream.In China, stocks bounced back from Tuesday's stumble as investors focussed on the buzz surrounding DeepSeek's artificial intelligence breakthrough.Back on Wall Street, Lyft dropped 12% after the ride-hailing company forecast current-quarter gross bookings below estimates - dragging bigger rival Uber down 1%.Super Micro Computer advanced 5% after the server maker said it believes it will be able to file delayed annual and quarterly reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by February 25.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:* US January consumer price inflation report* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's reprises semiannual monetary policy testimony before House Financial Services Committee. Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic both speak. Bank of England policymaker Megan Greene speaks* India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington* Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meets EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa in Brussels* US corporate earnings: Cisco, Kraft Heinz, Albemarle, Paycom, Biogen, CME, CVS, MGM, Dominion, Equinix, Interpublic, NiSource, Rollins, Smurfit WestRock, Tyler, Ventas, Westinghouse etc* U.S. Treasury sells $42 billion of 10-year notes(By Mike Dolan, editing by Hugh Lawson; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)"

        "content": "Improving international sales helped McDonalds overcome some weakness at home in the fourth quarter, but the company said it expects U.S. sales to pick up later this year.McDonald's said its sales are continuing to recover from an E. coli outbreak last fall tied to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. The Chicago burger giant said it's also struggling to get low-income consumers back into its stores despite expanding discounts.McDonalds U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 1.4% in the fourth quarter.On a conference call with investors Monday, McDonald's Chairman, President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said industry-wide fast food sales to low-income consumers were down double-digits in the U.S. in the October-December period.Thats the landscape that were looking to navigate through. Its why its so important that we make sure that we have a strong value program, Kempczinski said.McDonalds U.S. sales slowed in the first half of 2024 as customers grew tired of price increases. The company responded in June with a $5 value meal that reignited traffic. The deal was so successful that the company extended it through next summer.But then an E. coli outbreak, which was first reported Oct. 22, sickened at least 104 people in 14 states, including 34 who were hospitalized, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One person in Colorado died.The FDA closed its investigation into the outbreak in December, saying McDonald's contained it once it stopped serving the raw onions the virus was linked to. But Kempczinski said the outbreak hurt sales of the Quarter Pounder, which is usually a big profit-generator.Sales also remain weaker in the Rocky Mountain states where the outbreak was centered, Kempczinski said. McDonald's doesn't expect them to recover until the beginning of the second quarter.McDonald's said it is working to get customer traffic back up in the U.S. and will then layer in new products that will generate excitement and increased spending. The snack wrap, a menu item that has generated a lot of excitement, will return sometime this year, and McDonald's is also planning a new chicken strip offering, Kempczinski said.Kempczinski said the company is also learning a lot about demand for beverages like energy drinks from the beverage-focused CosMc's chain it has been testing since early last year. Kempczinski said the company is trying to figure out how it can capture that demand within its existing restaurants.International sales in McDonald's company-operated markets edged upward slightly in the fourth quarter, with particularly strong sales in Germany and Italy. But Kempczinski said McDonald's is also struggling to draw lower-income consumers in the U.K.The bright spot for the fourth quarter was McDonald's licensed markets overseas, where same-store sales climbed 4.1%. McDonalds said it saw strong sales growth in the Middle East, where sales have struggled in recent years, and Japan.Overall, McDonalds global same-store sales rose less than 1% for the fourth quarter. That was better than the 1.1% decline Wall Street had forecast, according to analysts polled by FactSet.Fourth-quarter revenue fell slightly to $6.38 billion, just short of the $6.45 billion analysts were expecting.The companys fourth-quarter net income also fell, 1% to $2.01 billion. Adjusted for one-time items, McDonalds earned $2.83 per share, which was lower than the $2.85 per share than Wall Street anticipated.McDonald's shares rose more than 4% in early trading Monday."

Playa's shares were up 2%, while Hyatt was flat.The U.S. hospitality chain, which owns a 9.4% stake in Playa, expects the deal to close later this year.Hyatt said it would identify third-party buyers for Playa's owned properties and expects to gain at least $2 billion from the sale of assets by 2027.This is part of Hyatt's asset-light business model, where the operator prefers not to own physical properties but to manage or franchise them.\"Recycling the owned real estate... and retaining management contracts on the hotels should be highly accretive, but also requires time and incremental cost,\" Jefferies analyst David Katz said.\"Although we do not anticipate regulatory complexities, the process and time to closing also presents incremental, albeit modest risk,\" he added.Playa's portfolio also comprises resorts for rivals such as Hilton Worldwide, Marriott International, Wyndham and UK-based InterContinental Hotels Group's Kimpton brand.An unknown is if Hyatt can convert non-Hyatt flagged hotels to Hyatt hotels, should it sell these properties, Truist Securities analyst Patrick Scholes said.(Reporting by Aishwarya Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"

        "content": "By Georgina McCartneyHOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices settled down more than 2% on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump took the first big step toward diplomacy over the war in Ukraine he has promised to end, a war that has supported oil prices on concerns about global supplies.Brent futures settled down $1.82, or 2.36%, at $75.18 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down $1.95, or 2.66%, to $71.37.U.S. crude futures fell more than $2 at their session low. The declines follow three days of gains, during which Brent climbed 3.6% and WTI rose 3.7%.U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the war in Ukraine in phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\"Trump doing peace talks, I think that has taken some of the risk premium out of oil prices right now,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.In a post on his social media platform, Trump said he and Putin had \"agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskiy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now.\"Zelenskiy's office said Trump and Zelenskiy had spoken by phone for about an hour.Investors also tried to gauge the Federal Reserve's next moves on cutting interest rates following comments on Tuesday by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and after data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in January.\"The combination of higher inflation and the possibility of peace (in Ukraine) is causing a bit of a sell off in the market at the moment,\" said Price Futures Group's Flynn.Powell said the economy is in a good place and the Fed is not rushing to cut rates further, but is prepared to do so if inflation drops or the job market weakens.Consumer price data released by the U.S. Labor Department showed surprisingly strong U.S. inflation in January, stoking fears that a heating economy and looming tariffs could undercut hopes for rate cuts. Higher rates can slow economic activity and dampen demand for oil.\"The inflation numbers came in hot, reducing the chances of the Fed cutting rates from September to December,\" said Price Futures Group's Flynn.U.S. crude oil stocks posted a larger-than-expected build last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. Gasoline inventories meanwhile posted a surprise draw while distillate stocks posted a surprise build. Elsewhere, Russia may be forced to throttle back its oil output in the coming months as U.S. sanctions hamper its access to tankers to sail to Asia and Ukrainian drone attacks hobble its refineries.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said in a monthly report that global oil demand will rise by 1.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2025 and by 1.43 million bpd in 2026. Both forecasts were unchanged from last month.The EIA increased its estimate for U.S. crude production while leaving its demand forecast unchanged. It now expects U.S. crude oil output to average 13.59 million bpd in 2025, up from its previous estimate of 13.55 million bpd.The Trump administration named Kathleen Sgamma, a vocal oil and gas advocate for Western states, to head up the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which manages the use of the country's nearly 250 million acres of public lands.(Reporting by Georgina McCartney in Houston, Colleen Howe, Trixie Yap, Arunima Kumar and Ahmad Ghaddar; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, David Goodman, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and David Gregorio)"

        "content": "By Mimosa Spencer and Tassilo HummelPARIS (Reuters) - French luxury group Hermes reported fourth-quarter results well above analyst expectations on Friday, showing robust appetite from wealthy consumers for its most expensive items including Birkin bags, which cost upwards of $10,000.Posting quarterly sales up by around 18%, Hermes continues to outshine rivals like LVMH and Kering-owned Gucci as the industry suffers its slowest sales in years. Global luxury sales fell around 2% last year, hurt by a property crisis crimping spending in China and inflation-weary shoppers elsewhere.\"We are celebrating an excellent year, in a tougher environment,\" Axel Dumas, executive chairman, told journalists on a call.Shares in the company rose 4.5% in early Paris trade, lifting European peers. They were up 2% at 0952 GMT.Hermes' shares are up by a quarter over the last 12 months, with its market capitalisation, currently at just below 297 billion euros ($311.11 billion), edging closer to that of luxury rival LVMH, Europe's most valuable listed company, which employs almost ten times more staff across its 75 brands, LVMH data shows.Hermes has long focused on creating timeless, ultra-high-end products and maintaining deliberate scarcity.\"Hermes further confirms that during Q4, the luxury consumer was there, including in China, for the brands with solid momentum and execution,\" JP Morgan analysts said.On Thursday, Italian outerwear maker Moncler also reported consensus-beating sales growth in the fourth quarter.Hermes said its sales for the fourth quarter came to 3.96 billion euros, an 18% rise at constant exchange rates, accelerating in the important end of year period, with the fastest growth in the Americas and Japan.The growth beat analyst expectations for a 10% rise, according to a Visible Alpha consensus cited by UBS.The Hermes leather goods and saddlery division, which accounts for nearly half of group revenue, grew the fastest, up 21.5%. Analysts had expected a rise of 13%.The double-digit growth at Hermes contrasts with LVMH's 1% rise over the last three months of the year.The Asia region excluding Japan is Hermes' biggest market and sales there grew 9% in the fourth quarter, despite the downturn in traffic in Greater China seen since the end of the first quarter of 2024.Executive Chair Dumas added, however, that it was \"too early to see an inflection\" in the industry, despite some positive signs.Hermes is known for its tight grip on production, sticking to an annual increase of around 6-7% a year, with order backlogs cushioning it from falling demand while holding up the label's exclusive aura.Sales in the Americas region clocked 22.3% growth, matching growth in Japan.Asked about the impact from potential U.S. tariffs on European goods, Dumas said the company would not adjust its production.\"We are attached to keeping our production where it is,\" he said, citing France for leather goods, Switzerland for watches and Italy for shoes.\"We'll adapt to tariffs, and raise prices accordingly,\" he added.The company is raising prices 6-7% this year to reflect higher production costs and exchange rates, Dumas said, slightly less than last year's rise.($1 = 0.9563 euros)(Reporting by Mimosa Spencer and Tassilo Hummel; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle, Dominique Patton, David Evans and Susan Fenton)"

        "content": "January data from Cass Information Systems showed truckload linehaul rates turned positive on a year-over-year comparison for the first time in two years. However, shipments remained soft.The TL linehaul index, which tracks rates without fuel and accessorial surcharges, posted a 0.8% y/y increase for the month. This was the first positive y/y change since December 2022. The index also increased 0.6% from December, the fifth consecutive sequential increase.Winter storms in January were more impactful than normal, pushing TL spot rates higher for a stretch. The report highlighted the rate turnaround but cautioned that a meaningful recovery could take time.There you have it, folks, another important positive freight cycle inflection, the Thursday report said. For those looking for something similar to the past two cycles, expect a long wait, but this cycle is moving in a positive direction.The linehaul rate index includes changes to both spot and contract freight.The dataset remained lower on a two-year comparison, off 5.2% compared to January 2023. The index fell 3% in 2024 following a 10% decline in 2023.January 2025y/y2-yearm/mm/m (SA)ShipmentsExpendituresTL Linehaul IndexShipments captured by the Cass Freight Index slid 5.3% from December (down 2.7% seasonally adjusted). The volumes index was off 8.2% y/y and 15.1% on a two-year-stacked comp, the worst decline since the 2020 COVID lockdowns.The shipments index is trucking-centric, with more than half of recorded spend being moved by a truckload carrier.January is a soft month for freight demand, and winter storms in areas not accustomed to them, like in the South and Southeast, knocked carrier networks offline for days.The report also pointed to private fleets carrying more freight than they have in the past as a headwind to for-hire truck volumes. The forecast calls for the shipments index to decline approximately 10% y/y in February but potentially by a lesser amount if weather cooperates.The fourth-quarter earnings season provided mixed commentary from TL management teams. The consensus is that demand is still tepid but pricing conversations signal contract rates will be up this year. Carriers Schneider National (NYSE: SNDR) and Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ: WERN) said the tide is turning while spot broker Landstar System (NASDAQ: LSTR) said the market is stuck between cycles.Cass freight expenditures index, which captures total freight spend including fuel, was down 4.2% y/y and 2.6% from December when seasonally adjusted (down 27.5% on a two-year-stacked comp). The y/y decline was a little worse than in December, but it was all tied to the falloff in shipments.When netting the change in shipments from the change in expenditures, actual freight rates were likely up 4.3% y/y and higher sequentially for a fifth consecutive month.The first outlook for inferred rates in 2025 calls for a low- to mid-single-digit percentage increase.Perhaps the most important takeaway this month is that while volumes remain soft, capacity has adjusted enough to result in modestly higher rates, the report said.Extraordinary post-pandemic insourcing at private fleets is still weighing on for-hire demand, but as cost economics reassert their influence, the long-term trend toward outsourcing will eventually return.Data used in the indexes comes from freight bills paid by Cass (NASDAQ: CASS), a provider of payment management solutions. Cass processes $36 billion in freight payables annually on behalf of customers.More FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden:Werner optimistic after tough Q4XPO shares up on strong Q4 financial performanceOld Dominion poised to take share when market turnsThe post Cass TL linehaul index up y/y for first time in 2 years appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "The Vanguard Group this week whacked fees on 168 mutual fund and ETF share classes across 87 funds, lowering its expense ratios by an average of 20%.Its the largest annual expense ratio reduction in Vanguards nearly 50-year history.The result: Its average asset-weighted expense ratio is now 0.07%  a fraction of the industry average of 0.44%.Fee cuts are always a positive sign, Daniel Sotiroff, a senior research analyst at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance. The impact for Vanguards investors is positive, but it isnt going to be huge, largely because its fees are already really low.Some of the funds on the Vanguard slash list include: Russell 1000 Value ETF (VONV), down to 0.07% from 0.08%; International High Dividend Yield ETF (VYMI), down to 0.17% from 0.22%; Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX), down to 0.04% from 0.05%; Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF (VWOB), down to 0.15% from 0.20%; and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VYM), down to 0.05% from 0.06%.To really understand why you should care about reduced fees  even by fractions of a point  you need to know what a low expense ratio actually means.Vanguards fee cuts are a win for retail investors  you and me  helping to boost long-term returns, said Mark Johnson, an investments and portfolio management professor at Wake Forest University. In todays market, expense ratios under 0.10% (10 basis points) are considered low, and Vanguards announcement aligns with founder Jack Bogles philosophy of maximizing returns by minimizing costs.Read more: How to start investing: A 6-step guideThat clearly remains the companys mission: At Vanguard, were focused on creating value for our investors, not extracting value from them, Salim Ramji, Vanguards CEO, said in a press release.Id be remiss not to mention that this massive fee cut comes on the heels of Vanguard agreeing to pay more than $106 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading statements related to capital gains distributions and tax consequences for retail investors who held Vanguard Investor Target Retirement Funds (Investor TRFs) in taxable accounts, according to an SEC order.The blow to Vanguards revenue from the new expense ratio cuts  estimated to be about $350 million this year  is the bigger thing that matters in my opinion.It shows that Vanguard is willing to give up a pretty substantial amount of revenue this year, and in future years, for the betterment of its clients, Sotiroff said.Moreover, you could see some fee competition kick up.There were some low-cost index funds in Vanguards list that are now a few basis points cheaper than comparable funds from competitors, particularly on broad international stock ETFs, said Sotiroff.Id be watching for announcements from BlackRock, State Street, and Charles Schwab to see if they make any cuts in the near future.You can find the expense ratio on a mutual fund or ETFs profile page. For example, when you click on Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares, you can scroll down to find the expense ratio of 0.13%.But you wont find what is under the covers of that expense ratio.Its not spelled out in your account statement in the way a service fee or trading commission is shown.The specific details on the expense ratio fee that will be deducted from your investment returns can be found in a prospectus, which each mutual fund and ETF files with the SEC. You can track down that document on the funds site.Simply put, expense ratios account for a range of costs including what a mutual fund or ETF pays for management advisory fees as well as fees that pay for the cost of marketing and selling the fund and other shareholder services, transfer-agent costs, and legal and accounting fees.The total annual fund operating expenses are expressed as a percentage of the fund's net average assets, not a flat dollar figure.As each fund passes its fiscal year-end, the annual expense ratio is calculated by dividing the fund's operational expenses by its average net assets. These expenses are pulled from dividend and capital gains distributions you would receive, not the principal, according to Vanguards fund data.Fees have been falling in recent years. In 2023, index equity mutual funds had an asset-weighted average expense ratio of 0.05%, or just $5 for every $10,000 invested, according to research by the Investment Company Institute. Compare that to 0.42%, or $42 for every $10,000, for actively managed equity mutual funds.Many investors understand that low fees matter because they leave more money invested and compounding over time, Johnson said.Im not convinced of that. While many folks may be hip to fees, they dont focus on the reality of the dent they make in their future nest eggs.No matter how minuscule that expense ratio may appear, it has an outsized impact on your investment returns over time. When youre saving for retirement, thats the heart of it.Consider this: Youre 35 years away from retirement and have a current 401(k) account balance of $25,000. If returns on investments in your account over the next 35 years average 7% and fees and expenses reduce your average returns by 0.5%, your account balance will grow to $227,000 at retirement, even if there are no further contributions to your account, according to calculations by the US Department of Labor.If fees and expenses are 1.5%, however, your account balance will grow to just $163,000. The addition of a mere 1% annually over a 35-year span can cut your retirement account by 28%.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) provides a fund analyzer on its site to help you run the cost comparisons between thousands of mutual funds and ETFs.Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.As investment management companies compete to attract clients with low-fee fund options, Johnson predicts theyll try to cross-sell clients on additional services once they join.Cue Ramjis recent interview with the Wall Street Journal: As clients enter retirement and theyre thinking about income, theyre thinking about other sets of things that they might not have thought about during the accumulation days  their desire for advice grows, and we want to offer more of that capability at Vanguard, he said.Just this week I received an email from Vanguard touting its suite of advisory services offering a range of support to prepare a future for your beneficiaries, from tax-efficient strategies and portfolio management to retirement planning and advice tailored to you.I was curious enough to explore my options, whether I wanted automated investment management or an adviser who could serve as my personalized sounding board.I discovered I could pay an annual advisory fee of $15 for every $10,000 I had invested at Vanguard to have access to a robo-advisor or $30 for every $10,000 invested as long as I had at least $50,000 in Vanguard accounts for a hybrid personal adviser and robo-helper.Read more: Robo-advisor: How to start investing right awayIf I had $500,000 or more invested with the firm, Id shell out no more than $30 per $10,000 invested to work directly with a certified financial planner and get a personalized plan.Not bad.

        "content": "A casual observer might easily look at the $10 trillion exchange-traded fund industry as it wades into its fourth decade of existence and assume most of the potential innovation and creativity is already represented among the 4,000-plus ETFs trading in the U.S.All it takes is a glance at recent developments across the industry to realize the change is constant, unavoidable and not something to be ignored by investors and financial advisors.Exchange-traded funds have come a long way since the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) debuted as the first ETF in January 1993. But the creativity seems to have ramped up a few notches over the past few years with the advent of single-stock ETFs that let traders leverage long or make short bets on individual companies through ETFs.Buffer ETFs are another category that have been embraced by financial advisors and their clients in or near retirement. Buffer and defined outcome ETFs are sometimes referred to as boomer candy for their growing appeal among an investor set looking to take some risk off the table while staying in the market.And lets not overlook the impact of cryptocurrencies on the ETF space, most famously represented by the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as the most successful ETF start ever. It has generated about $41 billion in inflows.Add to that the recent move by Vanguard Group to cut the expense ratios on more than half of its 88 ETFs and youve got an old fee-pressure strategy representing yet another wrinkle in the ETF space.At least one analysis of the fee cuts by the renowned low-cost provider is connecting the news to a sudden stock price decline by BlackRock Inc. (BLK).Shares of the worlds largest asset manager have dropped by about 9% since the Vanguard price cuts were announced last month.While it's difficult to draw a direct line between the fee cuts and BlackRocks stock price, it would be hard to imagine Vanguards move is not already rippling through corporate boardrooms at ETF issuers.It is against that backdrop that the College for Financial Planning, in partnership with BlackRock, has started the ETFs & Portfolio Construction Certificate Program for financial advisors.With ETFs representing the most popular investment vehicle among financial advisors and the ETF space pushing resources toward advisors with increasing imagination and enthusiasm, it only makes sense that such a program would emerge.ETFs, the most user-friendly investment vehicle, are getting more complex by the day, and financial advisors must keep up.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "US stocks moved higher on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs but delayed their implementation, while investors digested another report that suggested inflation is once again heating up.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added more than 0.7%, or over 350 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) put on over 1% and closed at 6,115.06, just shy of its record close of 6,118.71 . The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) rallied.Markets took a fresh tariff announcement from Trump in stride. In a briefing Thursday afternoon, Trump called for \"fair and reciprocal\" tariffs on all US trading partners. But the measure he signed fell short of immediately implementing those tariffs. Instead, they would go into effect as early as April, theoretically leaving wiggle room for any countries to negotiate before then.\"I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them,\" Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office.Meanwhile, January's Producer Price Index (PPI) showed wholesale inflation remain sticky, after a similarly hot consumer inflation print for the month dented optimism for an interest rate cut.Earnings season rolls on, looking solid after a majority of beats from the almost 70% of S&P 500 companies to have reported so far. Robinhood (HOOD) shares soared on the heels of a fourth quarter profit beat after the bell on Wednesday. But Reddit's (RDDT) stock tumbled amid a miss in user growth at the social media company.Airbnb (ABNB) stock rose more than 15% after the company topped Wall Street's expectations for revenue and earnings per share in the fourth quarter.Airbnb reported fourth quarter revenue of $2.48 billion above estimates for $2.42 billion. Meanwhile, Airbnb's earnings per share of $0.73 topped Wall Street's expectations of $0.59.While the 2025 stock market hasn't been all about tech, one original member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks has been a standout.Meta (META) added less than 1% on Thursday to close higher for the 19th consecutive trading session. The stock is now up more than 24% this year. After two years of only a few names driving the S&P 500 (^GSPC) higher, the early market action in 2025 calls to mind a common refrain among Wall Street strategists: It's a stock picker's market.As of Wednesday's close, 48% of the S&P 500 is outperforming the index in 2025, in line with the 25-year median and above the 29% seen last year. As Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, the last two years had marked the lowest number of stocks outperforming the index in 25 years.\"We think 2025 be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms,\" Bernstein told Yahoo Finance in January.Thus far, of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, just Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) are outperforming the roughly 4% gain of the S&P 500.Wall Street is increasingly pondering the possibility of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve sometime in the back half of 2025, or possibly in 2026.After a hotter-than-expected reading on consumer prices for the month of January, Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote \"hikes remain unlikely, but they seem less inconceivable\" after the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reading.RBC Capital Markets head of US rates strategy Blake Gwinn told Yahoo Finance there's a \"plausible\" scenario where a rate hike comes into play in 2025. But he doesn't believe it would be prompted by tariffs pushing inflation higher, which many have argued could happen if President Trump carries on with his current policy plan.\"I think to some extent the Fed will look through one-time direct price increases,\" Gwinn said. \"If you're seeing a pass-through of those tariffs to consumers, they can kind of write that off to some degree. It's something that I don't think is very a very good use case for rate hikes to counter because it is coming from tariff policy.\"Instead, Gwinn believes mass deportations, which Trump has proposed, could prompt hikes as the labor force shrinks and employers are forced to pay workers higher wages amid a reheating of the labor market.\"If we start seeing wage pressure coming from the continued declines of in immigration, that could actually be more meaningful for the Fed and could be something that I think is more risk of a hike later this year than even tariffs,\" Gwinn said.Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:President Donald Trump on Thursday signed his plan for reciprocal tariffs on \"both friend and foe\" but delayed their implementation as his administration launches negotiations with nations that could be impacted on a one-by-one basis.Up first is India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to visit the White House later this afternoon for a series of meetings. Modi may try to use issues like energy as a means to blunt the tariff impact in his country.\"I will charge a reciprocal tariff, meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them,\" Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office.Read more here. Arm stock rose more than 7% after the Financial Times reported Arm will launch its own new AI chip with Meta as one of its first customers.Citing people familiar with the matter, the Financial Times added Arm will unveil its first chip \"as early as this Summer.\"Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports:30-year mortgage rates inched slightly lower this week during a volatile period for bond markets but remained close to 6.9%.The average 30-year mortgage rate fell two basis points to 6.87% this week through Wednesday, from 6.89% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year mortgage rate rose slightly to 6.09%, from 6.05%.The 6.87% level is the lowest seen so far in 2025, but mortgage rates have been stuck in an extremely narrow band after hitting a year-to-date high of 7.04% in mid-January.Read more here.Two fresh inflation readings for the month of January showed prices increased more than Wall Street had expected but economists found positive news for markets and the Federal Reserve within the details.When evaluating categories from both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) that feed into the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumptions Expenditures (PCE) index, economists argue price increases likely decreased in the month of January.Inflation Insights president Omair Sharif told Yahoo Finance that Thursday morning's PPI release brought some \"good news\" for the Fed's fight against inflation after CPI data shook up markets on Wednesday. Sharif estimates that \"core\" PCE, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, will likely show prices increased 2.6% in January, down from the 2.8% seen in December.\"We're just, you know, continuing to kind of creep our way towards the Fed's 2% target,\" Sharif said.Following the PPI release, the 10-year Treasury yield slid nearly 10 basis points, eliminating its move higher from the day prior that had weighed on stocks in Wednesday's trading session. All three major indexes were higher as yields moved lower, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) adding more than 1%.The odds the Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady through the end of its July meeting decreased following the release. Investors now place a 50% chance the Fed doesn't cut interest rates at its July meeting, down from a 58% chance seen the day prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) gained more than 3% on Thursday, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Nvidia shares are now positive year to date, after hitting a low of $113 in early February.On Thursday, EV giant Tesla (TSLA) also extended gains from the prior session, rising more than 4%.Apple (AAPL) gained more than 1%.Meanwhile, social media platform Meta (META) pared modest gains to dip just below the flat line.If Meta manages to climb back into green territory, it would be on track to hit its 11th high of 2025 as it eyes a 19-day win streak.Oil prices pared losses on Thursday as the market discounted efforts to initiate a peace solution in Ukraine.Traders also assessed how retaliatory US tariffs against countries with levies on US goods could impact economic growth and demand for oil. President Trump is expected to formally announce those tariffs this afternoon.West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) and Brent futures (BZ=F) were less than 1% lower, paring earlier losses.On Wednesday, Trump posted on social media that he spoke with President Vladimir Putin and said the Russian president \"wants to make PEACE.\"Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports:Elon Musk is willing to pull his $97.4 billion bid for the nonprofit that oversees OpenAI if its directors agree to stop the transformation of the ChatGPT maker to a for-profit enterprise, escalating his long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\"If [the] OpenAI board is prepared to preserve the charity's mission and stipulate to take the 'for sale' sign off its assets by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid,\" lawyers for Musk said in a court document Wednesday.Musk's lawyers said in their filing that Altman breached his responsibility to OpenAI's charitable nonprofit by single-handedly turning down the takeover bid from a Musk-led investor group before OpenAI's board had reviewed it.Read more here.US stocks gained on Thursday, shaking off an expected announcement on reciprocal tariffs from President Trump later in the day, while investors digested a hotter-than-expected read on wholesale prices.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also gained 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.3%.President Trump indicated he would announce reciprocal tariffs today that would potentially target countries that impose levies on US goods.The new tariffs would come on the heels of levies on steel and aluminum imports announced earlier this week and duties on some Chinese goods that went into effect last week.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index in January rose 0.4%, more than the expected increase of 0.3%. The reading highlighted that the Fed still has work to do in order to bring inflation down to a 2% target.Wholesale prices ticked higher than expected last month, highlighting that the Federal Reserve's fight against sticky inflation isn't over.The Producer Price Index in January rose 0.4%, more than the expected increase of 0.3%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released on Thursday morning.Meanwhile, January's PPI rose 3.5% from a year ago.The reading for the month of December was revised up to 0.5%, from 0.2%.The major averages shook off the hotter-than-expected reading, with futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) and S&P 500 (ES=F) both rising slightly.

This, along with the possibility of Trump pausing some tariffs, boosted market sentiment, despite Wall Street's decline the day before.Japan's Nikkei 225 (^N225) gained 1.3%, while South Korea's Kospi (^KS11) rose 0.9%. However, the Shanghai Composite (000888.SS) dipped 0.2%.In energy markets, oil prices declined, with Brent crude (BZ=F) falling 2.7% to below $72 a barrel, partly due to optimism over US-Russia peace talks. These declines and a 3% drop in Exxon Mobils (XOM) stock added to market pressures. Despite this, Asian investors were more focused on the potential resolution of the Ukraine conflict and the growing strength of Chinas tech sector, which continues to see gains on the back of DeepSeek AI hype."

        "content": "(Reuters) -Air Canada forecast its 2025 core profit above analysts' estimates on Thursday, as the country's largest carrier relies on consistent international travel demand and a rebound in business bookings.The airline expects its 2025 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the range of C$3.4 billion ($2.39 billion) to C$3.8 billion, compared with analysts' average estimates of C$3.5 billion.The carrier has seen strong demand for its services to Asia Pacific and China and has been expanding capacity on these routes.Canada's largest carrier reported a quarterly operating revenue of C$5.40 billion in the quarter ended December 31, up 4% from a year earlier.Airlines with international routes are capitalizing on the growing demand for global travel, as consumers place greater emphasis on experiences rather than material goods.The Montreal-based company reported fourth-quarter adjusted per-share profit of C$0.25, versus a loss of C$0.12 in the year-ago period due to rising labor costs.However, costly labor agreements and rising aircraft maintenance expenses are squeezing carriers' profit margins.Last year, the Canadian flag carrier signed a new labor deal with its pilots, which would give the aviators a general four-year cumulative pay hike of about 42%, generating about C$1.9 billion in additional value.Air Canada is also facing significant foreign exchange costs due to the Canadian dollar's decline against the greenback, as investor concerns grow over the potential impact of a trade war between the two neighboring countries.The airline is also expected to take a hit from decreased cross-border traffic to the U.S., as Canadians choose to avoid trips south of the border after Trump's 25% tariffs on most Canadian goods.Trump has paused those tariffs for a period of 30 days.($1 = 1.4198 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary, Devika Nair and Mrinmay Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)"

Add a hot inflation print to the mix, and the market will sell off.Most Read from BloombergSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleThats according to the trading desk at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Market Intelligence, who estimate the S&P 500 will fall as much as 2% in the case consumer prices rose 0.4% or more in January from a month prior.Expect the bond market to react violently as it shifts its view to Fed Funds not being restrictive and the most likely next action of the Fed to be a hike rather than a cut, the team led by Andrew Tyler wrote in a note. The move in bond yields would pull the USD higher, further pressuring stocks.A lot is riding on the figures due 8:30 a.m. New York time. The market has overreacted to US consumer sentiment and inflation expectations data from the University of Michigan on Friday, Tyler said. That put an over-emphasis on the CPI print, they added.The strategists are tactically bullish on US equities, expecting the above-trend economic growth in the US, positive earnings and a neutral Federal Reserve with a dovish tilt. A slightly hotter print would refute that outlook, they said, even though the most likely outcome is for the monthly inflation figure to come between the 0.27%-0.33% range.The consensus estimate is for a 0.3% rise in month-on-month CPI, while the options implied move for the S&P 500 Index is just below 1%. Last month, the data triggered an outsized upward move for the stock market, and chances are that any small deviation from the forecast will again cause volatility.After a strong two-year rally for the S&P 500, investors are now grappling with the threat of Donald Trumps tariffs potentially stoking inflation higher, persistently elevated interest rates and lofty big tech valuations that are increasingly being questioned. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank doesnt need to rush to adjust interest rates on Tuesday, sending bond yields higher. Swap markets currently price in just one more rate cut this year.Goldman Sachs Group Inc.s Dominic Wilson said their forecast for the inflation print is slightly above the consensus.If we print around the consensus, there could be some mild relief, Wilson, a senior markets advisor, wrote in a note. We do think the underlying inflation pressures ex-tariffs are likely to prove more benign than the market expects, but tariffs are likely to offset that in the near-term and weve raised our inflation forecasts recently.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanAs world stocks got a fresh lift, the U.S. dollar has retreated to its lowest of the year so far on a mix of reversing U.S. Treasury yields and another delay in tariff implementation.Multiple cross-currents have hit macro markets this week - a whipsaw effect from two big U.S. inflation reports, Washington's push for Ukraine peace talks alongside threats of sweeping tariffs and another heavy schedule of corporate earnings and Treasury debt sales.But as Friday trading gets underway, the net impact on the dollar index has been to sink it to its lowest in almost two months - driven in part by a benign take on January's U.S. producer price report and a Ukraine-related rally in the euro.Even after U.S. President Donald Trump teed up his latest plan for reciprocal tariffs as \"the big one\", it transpired these won't hit early.Thursday's directive stopped short of imposing the tariffs, instead kicking off what could be weeks or months of investigation into the levies imposed on U.S. goods by other trading partners and then devising a response.The dollar, which has typically jumped on tariff threats over recent months, fell back to January levels against the euro and yuan, two-month lows on the Canadian dollar and 10-day lows against Mexico's peso.The greenback was also undermined as Treasury yields completely reversed their spike after Wednesday's hot consumer price inflation report - mainly because details of yesterday's producer price report painted a different picture.As flagged by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell the previous day, components of the PPI are important for the calculation of the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation gauge. A number of these related to healthcare and airline fares actually fell sharply last month.That led Fed futures to marginally increase bets on Fed easing this year, pulling in the likely date of the next cut to September from October.The biggest impact was to knock long-term Treasury yields back lower, despite what was seen as tepid demand at the 10 and 30 year debt auctions this week.Along with the thrust from another robust corporate earnings season, the combination saw Wall Street stocks rally to within a whisker of new records on Thursday - led by big gains for megacaps Tesla, Nvidia and Apple.Futures held most of those gains overnight, with traders awaiting the release of U.S. retail sales and industrial production data later on Friday.Tech was back in vogue overseas too, along with the artificial intelligence buzz.Chinese tech stocks resumed their bullish rally on Friday to clock their best winning streak in over two years as DeepSeek's AI breakthrough continued to encourage buyers.The Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 5.6% to a three-year high at close, bringing the week's advance to 7.3% and recording a fifth consecutive week of gains. The rally was helped after a Reuters report that Chinese President Xi Jinping will chair a symposium attended by Jack Ma and other Chinese business leaders.Also encouraged by the likely longer timeline on U.S. tariff implementation, the broader Hang Seng index jumped 3.7% and the Chinese mainland index gained almost 1%.In European stocks, another week of stellar gains was also sustained on Friday.Unusually, given the trends of recent years, record high European stocks have far outstripped Wall Street so far this year - on a mix of more attractive valuations, European interest rate cuts and now talks to end the Ukraine war.Next week's German elections are also holding out some hopes for a subsequent easing of the country's strict fiscal rules and a possible boost to government spending there down the line.Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price forecast for the broader STOXX 600, citing factors such as a lower risk premium, reduced energy prices, improved consumer confidence, and a recovery of economic growth as the key drivers.The euro zone economy grew a touch faster than initially thought in the last quarter of 2024, according to data released on Friday.The Ukraine moves saw crude oil prices briefly tumble to their lowest of the year this week, although they stabilised earlier today.More pointedly for Europe, natural gas prices have been dragged back sharply from two-year highs. The benchmark Dutch gas contract retreated to its lowest in more than two weeks, helped by Ukraine news and talks over a loosening of European gas storage targets.And Europe's corporate earnings season has also lifted the mood. French luxury group Hermes rose 2% on Friday after it reported an 18% rise in fourth-quarter sales, lifting the wider luxury goods sector.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* US January retail sales, industrial production, import and export prices, December business/retail inventories* Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan speaks* US corporate earnings: Moderna* Munich Security Conference begins(By Mike Dolan, editing by Christina Fincher; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)"

        "content": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon made it clear during a visit to Washington, D.C., on Thursday that he is in favor of a restructuring of the financial regulatory agencies that oversee his bank and his industry.\"I think its time, in my view, to take a step back and look at all the rules and regulations put in place, he told reporters after a closed-door meeting with Republican lawmakers and other top bank CEOs on the issue of whether big lenders are \"debanking\" certain customers.\"You have got to take a step back and look at the whole thing.\"The new comments from the boss of the largest US bank coincide with attempts by the Trump administration to rein in one big bank regulatory agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and reportedly rethink how to restructure other big regulators that oversee the nation's largest lenders.Last weekend, the Trump administration ordered effectively all work at the CFPB to halt and barred employees from showing up to the agencys Washington, D.C., headquarters this week.Many Republicans have opposed the CFPB since its creation and have often called for its closure, arguing that Washington has too many redundant regulators.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also reportedly discussing plans to consolidate other bank regulators without Congresss input, according to a Wednesday report in the Wall Street Journal. The discussions include possibly folding the FDIC into the Treasury Department and combining it with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Dimon on Thursday did not sound overly concerned about the fate of the CFPB, which oversees how banks and other financial firms treat US consumers.\"There is consumer protection out of the SEC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the question is how do you design a system that is good for everybody, that makes sense. It isnt just for the CFPB alone,\" Dimon told reporters.Read more: These are the 3 best banks in the United States, according to their customersDimon even passed out a chart to reporters on his way into the meeting titled \"Complexities of the Regulatory System,\" with numerous lines drawn to the CFPB and other regulators that have some oversight of JPMorgan's various businesses.The chart, which was first printed in a Dimon letter to shareholders, is referred to by executives inside JPM as the \"spaghetti chart.\"Dimon on Thursday also repeated some points he has made previously about debanking, or whether banks deny services to certain customers.He told reporters that \"we dont debank people for their religious or political affiliations but that there are a lot of things that should be fixed\"  specifically anti-money laundering rules.Such rules \"are extraordinary, and it does cause a lot of people to be pushed out of the system because banks were afraid of being sued, fined, because if, after the fact, something goes wrong  coulda, woulda, shoulda  you could pay a billion dollars.\"When asked if he blamed regulators for the debanking problem, he said, \"Pretty much, yeah.\"Debanking was the main topic of the closed-door meeting with Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, other committee Republicans, and many of the nations other top banking CEOs.The list of bankers expected to attend included Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan, Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf, outgoing US Bancorp (USB) CEO Andrew Cecere, PNC (PNC) CEO William Demchak, Truist (TFC) CEO Bill Rogers, and Capital One (COF) CEO Richard Fairbank.The claim that big banks have discriminated against certain customers is gaining new visibility as the GOP presses for legislation that would better define when banks can decline service. The crypto industry has joined the call for changes after alleging that digital asset companies were unfairly denied bank services in recent years.President Donald Trump confronted Moynihan last month publicly about it at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Trump told Moynihan, I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank.The president also appeared to include Dimon in his confrontation.\"I don't know if the regulators mandated that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody else, I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong,\" Trump added.Last week, both the Senate and House held hearings on the issue and no bank executives were present. But the topic even drew support from one notable Democrat: Elizabeth Warren.\"Donald Trump was on to a real problem when he criticized Bank of America for its debanking practices,\" Warren said.One person familiar with Thursdays meeting said it was a candid, back-and-forth conversation focused on the problems of the current regime banks must follow and how it can lead to inappropriate debanking. Another said the majority of debanking problems can be fixed with clearer and less subjective guidelines on who bank examiners consider a risky customer.Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement following the meeting that \"its clear that regulators have seriously overreached on issues from Basel III to debanking, and Congress needs to work to rein in and right-size the impacts of the Biden administrations burdensome and arbitrary regulations.\"My message is clear: no regulator, and no financial institution, is above the principles of fairness and market access.\"David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

This exposure opens up CLO investment to a wide range of sophisticated investors.Michael Craig, head of European senior loans at Invesco Private Credit, added: We focus on CLOs from high-quality managers that we trust, as these tend to exhibit less volatility and better liquidity in stressed market conditions. We regularly perform stress-testing on our portfolios to simulate these scenarios.Atlanta-based Invesco manages $571.7 billion in 228 ETFs, including the $333.1 billion Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). That fund is the fifth-biggest in the U.S. and has gained 21% over the past year, roughly in line with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).Elsewhere, credit-focused asset manager Palmer Square Capital Management will enter European ETFs with three strategies capturing collateralised loan obligations (CLOs).This article was originally published in etf.com sister publication ETF Stream.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "Tesla is victorious in almost every court case thanks to a justice system that acts as the long arm of the Chinese Communist Party. \"The odds are stacked against you, the founder of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility told the AP.Tesla has adopted an unusual strategy to defend its brand from critics in China.According to an investigation by The Associated Press, the carmaker has sued more than a dozen journalists and even its own customers, weaponizing a legal system that operates as an extended arm of the Communist Party regime.In every case where a ruling has ensued, Tesla won its lawsuit. One of the few open cases remainsrelated to Zhang Yazhou, more on that belowand that is only because she is appealing the verdict handed down against her.Moreover, of the 81 civil judgements in which Tesla owners sued the company over safety and quality issues or contract disputes, only nine were victorious.The odds are stacked against you, Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility, told the AP. It like going to the casino and winning every hand.Zhang is famous for clambering on top of a Tesla in 2021 during the Auto Shanghai, one of the worlds biggest motor shows, to warn potential car buyers that its cars brakes can fail. She was in the passenger car seat earlier that year when an accident occurred that she blamed on Tesla, which sent her parents to the hospital with injuries.Capturing headlines across the industry, the stunt briefly sparked conspiracy theories among Tesla investors that either the Communist Party or a local competitor like Nio had put her up to it in an effort to besmirch the brand.Tesla subsquently sued her for defamation and won, with a Chinese court ordering her to pay more than $23,000 in damages and apologize publicly for her accusation.Musk can count on a powerful ally. Chinas second-highest ranking official behind president Xi Jinping is none other than the man that helped Elon Musk build his massive Chinese vehicle factory: state premier and former Shanghai party boss Li Qiang.While Tesla doesnt break down its actual production numbers, the manufacturing plant has a capacity of more than 950,000 units, according to the company. Fully utilized, that would likely make it the largest single site in the global industry.More than ever, Tesla is dependent on China for sales now that key markets including California and Europe show its car business is under severe pressure.Its not unusual for automakers to see cyclical peaks and troughs that coincide with their product cadence. In order to at least preserve its claim to being a growth stock, Tesla has sacrificed profits for volume, with its fourth-quarter automotive gross margin dropping to its lowest level in five years.UBS estimates sales of fully electric vehicles in China will grow 5% to 7.62 million vehicles this year. That means out of the 14.2 million EVs sold worldwide, more than every second will go to a Chinese customer.Although third-party data shows Teslas vehicle sales in China increased last year, its business there suffered a decline in revenue both in absolute value expressed in dollars as well as its importance relative to consolidated turnover.Tesla China saw its top line shrink 3.7% to $20.9 billion in 2024, according to the companys 10-K filing, with the country dropping a percentage point to make up 21.4% of group-wide sales.While its accounts do not explain why, it is almost certainly a reflection of the ongoing price war that has forced manufacturers like Tesla to offer a steady stream of rebates to prop up volumes.Zhang, for her part, didnt say whether she would remain with Tesla, but chances are the disgruntled owner will switch to one of the many domestic competitors like BYD. Shes also appealing the defamation ruling against her.I refuse to accept it, Zhang told the AP. As a consumer even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

        "content": "By Scott DiSavino(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for a third week in a row for the first time since December 2023, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report on Friday.The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by two to 588 in the week to February 14.Despite this week's rig increase, Baker Hughes said the total count was still down 33 rigs, or 5% below this time last year.Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 481 this week, while gas rigs gained one to 101.The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on paying down debt and boosting shareholder returns rather than raising output.Top oilfield services provider SLB is restructuring certain business functions and expecting more job cuts, according to a source familiar with the matter and an internal email seen by Reuters.The changes come as the Houston-based company has been working on a cost-savings initiative, according to the source, and is preparing for tepid growth this year as its customers are more cautious about spending amid concerns of an oversupplied oil market.Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would remain unchanged in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.6 million bpd in 2025.On the gas side, the EIA projected a 73% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. [NGAS/POLL]The EIA projected gas output would rise to 104.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.1 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Marguerita Choy)"

        "source": "Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Wall Streets defense of its DEI initiatives suddenly got a lot more complicated.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime advocate of diversity and using bank resources to aid minority communities, told employees this past week during a town hall that he \"was never a firm believer in bias training\" and had questions about money being spent on certain DEI programs.\"I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid shit, and it really pissed me off,\" Dimon said, according to a recording of the town hall reported by Bloomberg. \"Im just going to cancel them. I dont like wasted money in bureaucracy.\"Dimon was not specific about what he would cancel. He also said the banks approach to Black, Hispanic, and LGBTQ communities would not change, and that any plans for certain DEI initiatives were unrelated to Donald Trumps election as president.What was notable about Dimon's new comments is how outspoken he has been about his willingness to fight outside efforts to change JPMorgans DEI policies.\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last month.Some of the biggest companies on Wall Street, including JPMorgan, are increasingly targets of conservative activists seeking changes to DEI policies across corporate America.Over the past year, such pressure has contributed to DEI retreats at a number of other high-profile companies, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowes (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), John Deere (DE), and Target (TGT).Many of these retreats were influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.Corporate diversity goals are also coming under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and another that called for US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"My administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense, Trump told business leaders and politicians last month during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The National Center for Public Policy Research, the National Legal and Policy Center, and the Heritage Foundation have all submitted shareholder proposals seeking changes or deeper examinations of practices at several big banks.NCPPR and NLPC submitted anti-DEI proposals to Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan, while Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got proposals from NLPC and Heritage asking for audits of how the banks treat customers with certain political beliefs.Robby Starbuck, who built a social media following by criticizing companies for their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, has also set JPMorgan in his sights.\"JPMorgan ... they are going to end up being a target for us,\" the conservative Latino activist told Yahoo Finance recently.A spokesman for JPMorgan said this past week that the company's outlook on DEI isnt changing but that the company \"regularly review[s] and make appropriate adjustments to policies and programs, including in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision in 2023.\"The DEI \"moniker means different things to different people,\" but for JPMorgan, it is \"about doing what weve done for decades  trying our best to ensure that every customer and employee has a fair opportunity and that we serve communities and grow our company, the JPMorgan spokesman said.JPMorgans crosstown New York rival, Goldman, revealed a DEI change of its own this past week. It dropped a pledge to avoid taking a company public if that company had an all-white male board.Goldmans Tony Fratto, global head of corporate communications, said in a statement that as a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy.Goldman would not comment on whether it plans to hold firm on its other DEI policies posted on its website, which include advancing diversity along race, gender, and sexual orientation lines within hiring, employee mentorship and networks, vendor selection, and capital allocation.Goldman said that even though its IPO mandate is now gone, it still plans to offer its board diversity initiative to interested clients through its major global banking and markets division.We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach, Fratto said.The conservative activist asking Goldmans shareholders to approve an audit of the Wall Street giants DEI policies said the retreat doesnt go far enough.\"Had they come to us first and said, would you withdraw your proposal if we do this, I think we would pretty easily have said yes,\" Stefan Padfield, executive director of National Center for Public Policy Researchs (NCPPR) Free Enterprise Project, told Yahoo Finance.NCPPR has already notched one prominent Wall Street win. It was a co-plaintiff in a lawsuit that resulted in a December ruling that rejected Nasdaqs requirement that companies on its exchange set racial and gender targets.The group, which engaged with Goldman earlier this year, is asking the bank to conduct an independent third-party racial discrimination audit analyzing Goldmans legal and reputational risks stemming from its race-based initiatives.The IPO pledge abandoned by Goldman was among those initiatives highlighted by NCPPR. But it wants more changes.Now if they come back to the table and ask us to withdraw the proposal, we're going to have to have additional movement because they've already committed to do this, and they did not talk to us, Padfield added.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "source": "Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "How bleak is the future for low-cost airlines?For decades, budget carriers successfully offered travelers no-frills, cheap flights. But that scrappy business model is now eroding as costs soar and passengers opt for more comfortable seats and spacious upgrades.The business, it seems, can't even merge itself out of its tailspin.Earlier this week, Spirit Airlines (SAVEQ) once again rejected an acquisition proposal from Frontier (ULCC), valued at $2.16 billion. The offer was similar to the one Frontier presented earlier this month. Spirit countered, but its offer was rejected.Frontier's first takeover bid in 2022, for $2.9 billion in cash and stock, was foiled by a $3.8 billion offer from rival JetBlue (JBLU). Spirit filed for bankruptcy in November after a federal judge sided with the Justice Department to block its tie-up with JetBlue.The low-cost carrier model works by offering cheaper seats than traditional airlines to domestic and near-US destinations while charging fees for items like checked bags, seating selection, and snacks or drinks. Often, the airlines will use secondary airports with lower landing fees, such as Long Beach Airport in Los Angeles instead of LAX.But between increased competition from traditional carriers in domestic routes and rising labor and maintenance costs, the low-cost model has slowly unraveled.For example, amid activist investor pressure last year, Southwest (LUV) announced it would end its decades-long practice of open seating as part of a new strategy to grow revenue. Meanwhile, in January, Frontier also announced it would start offering seat upgrades and first-class seating by late 2025.\"That ultra-cost model is gone because they don't have ultra-low costs,\" aviation consultant Mike Boyd, president of Boyd Group International, told Yahoo Finance.\"The model,\" he added, \"is evaporating.\"The prospects for the industry are not encouraging for investors. JetBlue stock tumbled recently after the airline's 2025 outlook disappointed Wall Street. JetBlue cited higher costs and lower-than-expected revenue in its fourth quarter results.And late last month Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said the airline was \"experiencing above-normal unit cost inflation, most notably in market-driven wage rates, airport costs, and healthcare.\" Jordan referenced a $500 million cost reduction target for 2027 unveiled at the company's Investor Day last quarter, saying, \"We will be relentless in pursuing cost takeout.\"The cost woes are reflected in stock prices: The ultra-low-cost carriers have, for the most part, underperformed the broader airline market.Over the past 12 months, for instance, United Airlines (UAL) stock is up more than 140%, while Delta (DAL) has gained 60% and American (AAL) increased 7%. Among the low-cost carriers, Frontier is up about 15%, JetBlue is down 5%, and Southwest is down 10%.The bargain airlines have also been hit hard over the past year as travelers have opted for more international trips, and overcapacity in the domestic market has made it hard to raise prices in order to offset rising costs.\"Fuel costs cut into profit margins. Labor shortages increase personnel expenses. Also, competition is growing on regional routes,\" said Dean Rotchin, CEO and founder of BlackJet, a private aircraft firm.Low-cost airline execs have some solutions beyond cost-cutting.As a workaround, carriers have tried to expand into different markets. But they've seen mixed results, according to Boyd. The consultant points out that Frontier, for instance, is up against stiff competition from the majors (United, Delta, and American).\"You can't put one flight a day between Charlotte and Atlanta and Boston and think it's going to work when Delta has 12,\" he said. \"They have very little market presence in those markets, very little customer identify.\"To be sure, there are always bargain-hunting consumers who will jump at cheap fares.But is it enough?Dan Bubb, a former pilot and aviation historian at the UNLV Honors College, doesn't think so.\"There is a market there. Its just that you have to be very well capitalized in order to be able to sustain it,\" he said.Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "It's often difficult to make sense of regulatory actions and changes to the structure and size of regulatory units. In a quickly evolving sector like cryptocurrency, it's even more challenging than usual. Sometimes it's not certain whether a major new development is going to be a boost or lead to a bust -- and there can be persuasive arguments in both directions.If you're planning substantial crypto investments, understanding regulatory shifts and their implications is crucial. So here's what the latest big change is and what you need to do about it to stay ahead of the game.According to a report by The New York Times published on Feb. 4, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be reducing its 50-person cryptocurrency law-enforcement group in keeping with the preferred policies of the new presidential administration. It's unclear if any or all of the activities originally assigned to the group will be handled by the newly formed Crypto Task Force created as part of an initiative by the new administration.For now, what's certain is that the SEC's exercise of oversight of the cryptocurrency sector is set to get even weaker than it was before. From mid-2013 to the end of 2024, the SEC only executed 207 cryptocurrency-related actions, including litigation and other administrative proceedings.Still, this new development has some important implications for investors. The proponents of the scaled-down unit at the SEC include those who claim that the cryptocurrency sector will be able to grow faster with fewer regulatory impediments. While that might be true for matters like approving new types of financial derivatives a bit faster than before -- or approving them at all -- the argument starts to fall apart when considering the need to protect investors from outright illegal activity such that they're confident enough to commit their capital to cryptocurrencies at all.On chains like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Ethereum, where fraudulent activity and outright scams have plagued investors for years, experiencing even less enforcement is unlikely to change the status quo for the better.On the other hand, it is critical to note that it is probably difficult for the situation in many sub-sectors on these chains to get much worse, especially for meme coins. The vast majority of meme coins are already straightforward attempts to extract money from investors within minutes of their capital being committed. And serious investors do not dabble in those spaces for reasons other than a lack of enforcement.While legal protections would in theory reduce many of the risks of these assets, they are still fundamentally incredibly volatile, risky, and without a strong tie to any fundamental value.So there isn't necessarily a new headwind here even if there's certainly no tailwind to look forward to. Expect the fringes of these ecosystems to be as extractive and dangerous as ever.A larger and older chain like Bitcoin, (CRYPTO: BTC) is already deeply integrated into the traditional financial system and thus is at least partially covered by the protections affecting that sector. But it is not clear that less enforcement by the SEC will change much of anything at all.Investors can buy the coin directly in their retirement or brokerage accounts via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are still fairly tightly regulated. Despite their unreliability, cryptocurrency exchanges must still store and distribute user coins on demand; however, weaker regulations make them less appealing investment venues.Finally, those who are technically inclined can buy it and hold it on the blockchain directly, and it isn't as though the SEC was doing much to crack down on scams involving fake blockchain interaction software or other vectors for theft.For most investors, the paring back of the SEC's crypto enforcement unit won't have any tangible impacts immediately, and it might not ever.The major cryptocurrencies like Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are established enough that, despite the presence of some problematic activities on their chains, they also have strong and multifaceted investment theses which do not require anything in the way of regulatory guardrails to continue playing out. Those theses will remain true, so the coins are still very much worth buying.Just be aware that there are even fewer protections and even less hope of salvation if you lose your money investing in scam projects on their chain.Before you buy stock in Solana, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Solana wasnt one of them.

        "published": "2025-02-12T03:23:04Z",
        "source": "Associated Press",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  Most U.S. stocks fell Wednesday after a report showed inflation is unexpectedly worsening for Americans.The S&P 500 dropped 0.3%, though it had been on track for a much worse loss of 1.1% at the start of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 225 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite edged higher by less than 0.1%.Stocks pared their losses through the day as the price of oil eased. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude fell 2.7% below $72 after President Donald Trump  said he had agreed with Russias president to begin negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine. Such a move could free up the global movement of crude.Still, Wall Streets overall momentum remained downward, and the majority of stocks fell. Treasury yields also remained notably higher in the bond market, cranking up the pressure on financial markets after the mornings report said U.S. consumers had to pay higher prices for eggs, gasoline and other costs of living than economists expected.Overall inflation was 3% for U.S. consumers in January. That was worse than the 2.9% inflation rate of December, which is what economists expected to see again.The inflation report suggested not only that pressure on U.S. households budgets is amplifying but also that traders on Wall Street were correct  to forecast the Federal Reserve  will deliver less relief for Americans through lower interest rates  this year.The Fed had cut its main interest rate sharply from September through the end of last year, intending to make borrowing cheaper, help the economy and boost prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. But the Fed warned at the end of 2024 it may not cut rates by as much in 2025 because of worries about inflation staying stubbornly high. Its goal is to keep inflation at 2%, and lower rates can give inflation more fuel.Some investors were betting on the Fed not cutting rates at all in 2025, even before Wednesdays report on the consumer price index, or CPI.The hotter than expected CPI confirms investors anxiety regarding too-hot inflation that will keep the Fed on the sidelines, said Sameer Samana, head of global equities and real assets at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.And Januarys reading doesnt account for any of the tariffs that Trump has recently announced, with possibly more on the way,  which economists expect will raise prices for imports further. Tariffs will make their impact felt later in the year, Samana said.Following Januarys discouraging inflation data, traders are betting on a 29% chance the Fed will not cut rates at all this year, according to data from CME Group. Thats up from a less than 20% chance seen the day before.Such expectations sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury up to 4.62% from 4.54% late Tuesday, which is a notable move for the bond market.When a 10-year Treasury, which is seen as one of the safest investments possible, is paying that much in interest, investors are less likely to pay high prices for stocks, which carry a higher risk of seeing their prices go to zero. That puts downward pressure on U.S. stock prices that critics say already look too expensive after running to repeated records last year, with the latest for the S&P 500 coming last month.One of the few ways companies have to counteract such downward pressure on their stock prices is to deliver stronger profits.Gilead Sciences did just that, and its stock rose 7.5% after the pharmaceutical company topped profit expectations for the latest quarter. It credited strength for its HIV products, among other things.CVS Health  jumped 14.9% after easily topping Wall Streets revenue and profit expectations for the latest quarter.But topping profit forecasts isnt always enough. Ride-hailing app Lyft fell 7.9% despite reporting stronger earnings than expected. Lyfts revenue for the final three months of 2024 fell just short of analysts forecasts.Homebuilders and other companies that can feel pain from mortgage rates  staying higher amid a Fed on hold also weighed on the market. Home Depot fell 2.2%, Builders FirstSource sank 3.5% and Lennar dropped 2.7%.Exxon Mobil sank 3% as oil-and-gas companies fell broadly following the 2.4% drop for the price of a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, to $75.18.Frontier Group Holdings, the parent company of Frontier Airlines, lost 4.9% after Spirit Airlines rejected a third takeover bid from the budget rival. Spirit said that it would focus on its own plan to emerge from the protection of a U.S. bankruptcy court and stabilize its finances.All told, the S&P 500 fell 16.53 points to 6,051.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 225.09 to 44,368.56, and the Nasdaq composite added 6.09 to 19,649.95.In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly higher across much of Europe and Asia.___AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed."

Growth for the 2021 quarter was 32.1%, he said, amid a bounceback from COVID-19 pandemic weakness.The S&P 500 communication services sector, which includes companies such as Meta Platforms, is leading estimated fourth-quarter earnings gains among sectors, with year-over-year growth of 32.2%.That's followed by financials, with estimated growth of 29.9%, and consumer discretionary, with 24.8%, based on LSEG data.\"Earnings are holding up because the U.S. consumer is strong,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Results have helped to support the stock market despite worries that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates anytime soon and uncertainty over the impact of tariffs from the Trump administration.\"At the end of the day, the stock market is about those 500 companies in the S&P 500 - their earnings, their dividend policy and growth trajectory. That is actually what defines a market,\" Dollarhide said.(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

But its full-year performance worsened to a net loss of $128 million, compared with $97 million for 2023.Its operating EBITDA  earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  of $52 million was up $24 million year-over-year.The parent company of Corcoran, Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sothebys International Realty reported $1.4 billion in revenue, a 9 percent annual increase.Gross transaction volume was up 13 percent year-over-year, with units closed in the fourth quarter up 3 percent and prices up 9 percent.Anywhere was buoyed by growth in its luxury sector. The high-end segments posted gross volume that was up 20 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by 12 percent unit growth year-over-year.On the earnings call, CEO Ryan Schneider reiterated his stance for relaxing  but not repealing  the National Association of Realtors Clear Cooperation Policy. The chief executive appeared to take a veiled shot at fellow residential giant Compass, which has been on the vanguard of pushing for a repeal.Those advocating for full repeal are primarily advancing their own interests, Schneider said. Theres clearly an opportunity for players with listing scale to create private, off-market listing networks that only select agents can access, which clearly could enhance near-term economics.A shift to off-market listings hurts sellers ability to get the best price, Schneider said, and complicates pricing by decreasing publicly available comparables. But he noted that Anywhere, which he said has the most listings in the industry across its brands, is prepared to capitalize in the event of a CCP repeal.He also called out industry consolidation  another point of emphasis for Compass  and said that while he would be excited to augment our growth through M&A opportunities, the company will only be looking for deals that enhance the bottom line, not just the top line.Weve seen some deals in the market that we wouldnt do, he said, noting that Anywhere would likely be a cash  as opposed to equity  buyer if it does find an acquisition opportunity.Cost cuts to continueAnywheres commission splits again stayed steady, down 7 basis points year-over-year to 80.3 percent.Average commission rates again fell slightly, to 2.39 percent from 2.41 percent for its franchise groups and to 2.35 from 2.36 for its owned brokerage groups.Over 80 percent of buyers have opted to sign six-month exclusive buyer agreements, which were one of five agreements Anywhere rolled out in the wake of NAR practice changes going into effect last summer.Anywheres yearslong cost-cutting mission resulted in a realized cost savings of $125 million for 2024. CFO Charlotte Simonelli said that 40 percent of those savings were offset by growth-related costs and inflation.Anywheres free cash flow for the year was $70 million  roughly even with 2023  after excluding a $20 million litigation settlement payment, and the company expects a similar performance in 2025.The firm has also targeted another $100 million of cost reductions for 2025, and it continues to tout its use of artificial intelligence tools to improve efficiency. Schneider said the firm has used generative AI to halve the team needed to process over 50,000 transaction-related documents per day.Anywhere expects to bolster its performance in 2025, forecasting $350 million of operating EBITDA for the year, an increase of $60 million from 2024.But Simonelli said the housing market will be the single biggest swing factor for its projections, noting that there are currently some pretty wide ranges in industry forecasts.This January has shown early signs of growth, with the closed gross volume up 12 percent year-over-year and the open volume  open contracts and future closings  up 4 percent year-over-year.The housing market remains challenged, especially with a lack of supply and real pressure on the number of unit transactions, Schneider said.Anywhere claims first mover advantage ahead of NAR deadlineHeres where Compass, Anywhere stand after year of cost-cuttingAnywhere strikes buyer commission, NAR membership rules in proposed settlementThis article originally appeared on The Real Deal.

        "content": "The New York Stock Exchange announced plans to introduce NYSE Texas, relocating its Chicago operations to Dallas, marking a shift in the exchange landscape that could create new opportunities for exchange-traded fund issuers and investors.Texas has emerged as the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing more than $3.7 trillion in market value, according to the NYSE's announcement. The move comes as the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) files for regulatory approval to operate as a national securities exchange, intensifying competition in the region.While NYSE Texas represents a rebranding and relocation of NYSE's existing Chicago operations to Dallas, TSXE is an entirely new exchange building its electronic trading platform from the ground up.For the ETF industry, the addition of Texas-based exchanges could give fund companies more choices about where to list their products, potentially lowering costs. However, splitting trading across more venues raises questions about how easily investors can buy and sell ETFs.The creation of new exchange venues in Texas comes as the ETF industry continues to expand, with issuers seeking differentiated ways to bring products to market. Both NYSE Texas and TXSE have indicated plans to attract ETF listings, potentially creating a more competitive environment for issuers.The TXSE has raised $161 million in capital from major financial institutions, including BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Citadel Securities, and Charles Schwab (SCHW)companies that play crucial roles in the ETF ecosystem as issuers and distribution platforms.\"In the ETF space, branding, marketing, and distribution are everything. The decision to list with NYSE Texas offers issuersboth established and newa chance to tell their story and align their brand values with a location that resonates with today's business climate,\" said Springer Harris, chief operating officer of Teucrium ETFs.While operational changes may be limited, the creation of NYSE Texas could affect ETF trading dynamics. Paul Schatz, president of Heritage Capital, said additional competition in the exchange space \"will only help liquidity and spreads with more competition and unique competition.\"For ETF issuers considering listing venues, the emergence of NYSE Texas alongside TXSE could lead to reduced listing costs and enhanced market-making opportunities, according to Harris. However, the trading operations will likely remain centralized in Mahwah, New Jersey, maintaining the same infrastructure that ETF traders currently utilize.\"For existing issuers, making the move could serve as a bold branding statement about their identity. For new issuers, particularly those launching funds through white-label platforms, this adds another dimension to consider when choosing a listing venue,\" Harris says, pointing to the strategic considerations ETF companies now face.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

        "content": "American annual headline inflation for January came in at 3%, slightly above the 2.9% as generally expected. The dollar made gains in the aftermath in many of its pairs, showing an especially strong intraday movement against the yen. This article summarises the context of the latest American inflation then looks briefly at the charts of XAUUSD and EURUSD.January 2025 was the fourth consecutive month of rising inflation in the USA, so the current trend seems to be established:Energy rose last month for the first time in six months while prices for used vehicles and transport also rose on average. It wasnt very surprising to see the actual result slightly higher than the consensus given that the latest NFP showed a significant rise in average hourly earnings both monthly and annually.Participants in general also seem to have been considering the likelihood of higher inflation because the probability of a cut by the Fed in June started to decline last week. According to CME FedWatch, the probability of a hold at the current 4.25-4.5% in June is around 64% compared to only 34% this time last week.Comments this week from Jerome Powell to the Senate Banking Committee also seem to confirm that the Feds happy to wait. Dr Powell commented on the economys overall stability and pointed to the current funds rate being significantly lower than the peak last year.Overall, the risk of a significant resurgence of inflation seems to be rather lower now that the current uptrend looks relatively modest and the Fed is committed to a patient approach. Thats broadly positive for the dollar and, in itself, negative for gold although sentiment on the metal remains extremely positive at the moment.Higher inflation and the lower probability of the Fed cutting again in the first half of 2025 has put some pressure on gold despite sentiment overall remaining very strong in recent weeks. Meanwhile various other major central banks such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of England remain more dovish and demand for havens is high amid trade wars and a possible resurgence of geopolitical tension centred on the middle east.Golds extremely strong uptrend since the start of the year needs to pause sooner or later, and with the price having been within striking distance of $3,000 before inflation this seems like as good a place as any for that to happen. Overbought conditions have dominated since the middle of last month although buying volume in February so far has been particularly high.$2,900 doesnt seem yet to be a very significant area but the price might find some support around the 20 SMA before any potential test of $2,800. That would mean quite a deep retracement which seems somewhat questionable in the circumstances of such positive sentiment and high demand. $2,850 could be a zone of strong demand depending on upcoming political news; under the current circumstances an immediate new high is unlikely.Euro-dollar declined somewhat in the aftermath of slightly stronger American inflation but with relatively low volatility. Central banks expected policies in the next few months broadly favour the dollar, but the impact of the trade war is more ambiguous.With $1.02 and $1.05 looking like important areas of support and resistance respectively, EURUSD might be falling into a sideways trend, which is a fairly normal situation for a major forex pair. The slow stochastic is closer to neutral than oversold and theres no signal of saturation from Bollinger Bands.Although there was a large spike in buying volume on 3 February after that weekends gap, there wasnt much momentum upward after that except to close the gap. Traders are now looking ahead to various European releases including German inflation and eurozone-wide jobs and GDP, followed by ZEW sentiment on 18 February.This article was submitted by Michael Stark, an analyst at ExnessExness.The opinions in this article are personal to the writer.

Morgan described the multi-asset category as a $500 billion opportunity.JFLI, which has an expense ratio of 35 basis points, is starting with a two-third allocation to four JPMorgan ETFs and the remaining third spread across customized sleeves of individual securities.The underlying ETFs, in order of their weighting in the portfolio, are the JPMorgan BetaBuilders USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (BBHY), the JPMorgan Income ETF (JPIE), the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ).Schoenhaut said the underlying ETF weighting will likely remain at the current level, and that the risk profile of JFLI is comparable to a portfolio of 75% stocks and 25% bonds.However, he added, even with that much equity market exposure, an income approach helps with volatility management.Nate Geraci, president and founder of The ETF Store in Overland Park, Kansas, described the timing of the JFLI debut as ideal given that greater uncertainty has recently been injected into the markets.Investors are grappling with the potential impact of shifting policies on trade and immigration, the direction of inflation and interest rates, geopolitical risks and other factors, he added. Multi-asset solutions can be attractive to investors in this environment as a way to still participate in markets, while also managing risk.JPMorgan manages 65 ETFs that combine for more than $165 billion.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

The group has been striving to preserve its profitability in this market while facing sluggish volume growth and an aggressive pricing strategy from its peers.The group announced higher capital expenditure for 2025, at around 2.7 billion euros, for new store openings and investments in technology. Shares in the company, which have gained around 30% over the past year, were trading 4.9% lower at 1133 GMT, at the bottom of the Amsterdam Exchanges Index.The U.S. was \"materially below expectations\", due to an increase in pharmacy sales and wage inflation, while the European division \"performed much better than anticipated, with sales and underlying operating profit respectively 0.6% and 9.6% above consensus,\" ING analysts said in a research note.Ahold reported fourth-quarter sales broadly in line with analysts' expectations, at 23.28 billion euros thanks to strong holiday sales at its U.S. grocery stores and market share gains by its Dutch chain Albert Heijn.($1 = 0.9653 euros)($1 = 0.9642 euros)(Reporting by Alban Kacher, Helen Reid and Hugo Lhomedet; Editing by Rashmi Aich and Sharon Singleton)"

It's a cost. It'll have to be managed. It would be better not to have it relative to the U.S. business, but we are going to manage our way through.President Donald Trump hiked his 10% tariff on aluminum imports to 25% on Monday.The tariffs put a note of uncertainty into what was otherwise a better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings report from the Atlanta beverage giant.Coca-Cola reported unit case volumes up 2% in the October-December period, reversing a 1% decline in the third quarter. Wall Street had expected Cokes unit case volumes to be up less than 1%, according to analysts polled by FactSet.Coke's revenue rose 6% to $11.5 billion. That was also better than the $10.68 billion analysts were expecting.Quincey said limited-time offerings like Sprite Winter Spiced Cranberry, Fanta Beetlejuice and Oreo-flavored Coke helped drive sales in the fourth quarter, and more innovation is coming this year. This week, Coca-Cola Orange Cream is going on sale in the U.S. and Canada.Coke also saw improving sales in markets where it has been struggling, including China and the Middle East. On Monday, McDonald's also noted improving sales in the Middle East in the fourth quarter.Coca-Cola Zero Sugar saw strong growth globally in the fourth quarter, with case volumes up 13%. Water, coffee, tea and sports drink volumes were all up 2%, the company said Tuesday. Volumes for juice, dairy and plant-based drinks fell 1%.Coke hiked prices 9% in the quarter, partly due to intense inflation in markets like Argentina. Prices also rose because Coke sold a higher mix of premium beverages like Fairlife milk and Topo Chico sparkling water.Quincey said some lower-income consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe cut back on spending last year and may continue to pull back this year. But broadly, global demand was robust, he said.I think the the overall consumer environment is pretty stable in the sense that theres good economic growth on a broad-based view around the world, Quincey said.Coke has also tried to make its drinks more affordable by offering smaller pack sizes and refillable bottles.Coke's net income rose 11% to $2.2 billion for the October-December period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 55 cents per share. That also beat analysts' forecasts of 52 cents.For 2025, Coke said it expects organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%. The company's organic revenue grew 12% last year.Coke's shares rose nearly 4% in early trading Tuesday."

        "content": "(Reuters) - Duke Energy on Thursday raised its five-year capital expenditure plan to $83 billion, a 13.7% jump, as the utility looks to boost its grid to profit from an oncoming demand from data centers and increased electrification.U.S. power demand is expected to hit record highs in 2025 and 2026 due to growing demand from data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, and from homes and businesses for heat and transportation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Duke plans to issue $6.5 billion of equity over its 2025-2029 plan, including $1 billion this year, as it plans to fund roughly 40% of the increase in its capital plan with equity.To grow supply, it expects to add nearly five gigawatts (GW) of natural gas power in service by 2029-end.The company's 2024 to 2028 capex plan stood at $73 billion.For the fourth quarter ended December 31, income from Duke's electric and gas segments rose 5% overall to around $1.4 billion from the same reporting period last year.However, due to interest expenses, a high effective tax rate and storm costs, the power provider posted a profit of $1.66 per share on an adjusted basis for the reported quarter, in line with analysts' estimates, according to data complied by LSEG.Duke, the largest utility covering North and South Carolina, saw Hurricanes Debby, Milton and Helene hit its service territories, which ripped away miles of transmission lines and power poles, leaving tens of thousands of its customers without electricity.Higher-for-longer interest rates can weigh on utilities, as it makes investing in the construction and maintenance of critical infrastructure such as electrical grids more expensive.Revenues of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility came in at $7.36 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $7.33 billion, largely due to higher residential sales and higher rates.Duke forecasted 2025 earnings to be in the range to $6.17 per share to $6.42 per share, the midpoint of which is slightly below estimates of $6.33 per share.(Reporting by Seher Dareen in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)"

Large Wall Street firms soon plunged into the burgeoning asset class.Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund, all bought up portions of the newly launched financial products, according to SEC filings.Even Wisconsins pension fund joined in and bought almost $100 million shares in spot Bitcoin ETFs in the beginning of 2024.In total, investors have thrown more than $40 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and $3.2 billion into spot Ether ETFs, according to SoSoValue, a crypto data platform.Sidney Powell, the CEO and cofounder of Maple, which lets users lend and borrow crypto, told Fortune that Goldman Sachs most recent disclosure of its Bitcoin holdings indicates that deep-pocketed investors are becoming more savvy in their crypto investments.In addition to its ownership shares in spot Bitcoin ETFs, the investment bank also disclosed that it owned almost $700 million in spot Bitcoin ETF options.Goldman Sachs has bet more than $500 million that Bitcoins price will increase and hedged with an almost $160 million bet that its price will fall.They wouldnt be readily available without the ETF, Powell said of the Bitcoin options bets. It signals growing maturity in the Bitcoin and crypto space.Update, February 12, 2025: This article has been updated with a comment from Chris Kline, COO and cofounder of BitcoinIRA, as well as a sentence that Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%.Markets are on alert after Trump signaled in a social media post that his promised like-for-like tariffs will arrive later on Thursday. \"Today is the big one: reciprocal tariffs,\" he wrote.The reciprocal tariffs could target any country that imposes import duties on US products, meaning they have the potential to upend the US's relationships around the globe.

        "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has officially acknowledged Grayscale's application for what would be the first-ever spot XRP exchange-traded fund, according to a Thursday filing.The acknowledgment triggers a 240-day review period, giving the SEC until mid-October to make a final decision on the proposed ETF that would track XRP, currently the third-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $157.4 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.The SEC's willingness to review the XRP ETF proposal highlights a shift in the agency's stance, as the regulator continues its legal battle with Ripple Labs and amid broader changes in leadership that could signal a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation.According to the filing, the proposed fund would offer traditional investors regulated exposure to XRP through a familiar investment vehicle, with Coinbase Custody Trust Company serving as custodian. The trust structure mirrors Grayscale's existing bitcoin ETF, which launched after the firm successfully converted its bitcoin trust into an ETF last year.The filing acknowledgment follows the SEC's recent acceptance of Grayscale's applications for Solana and Litecoin ETFs, furthering the investment firm's expansion of its crypto ETF offerings since debuting its spot bitcoin products, Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), along with Ethereum-focused funds, Grayscale's Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH).NYSE initially filed the necessary paperwork for the XRP ETF in late January, followed by similar proposals from several major asset managers including Bitwise, Canary, WisdomTree, and 21Shares through the Cboe Exchange.The proposal comes amid strong market activity for XRP, with the token trading at $2.72, up nearly 11% over the past 24 hours with a daily trading volume of $8.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.The trust would use the CoinDesk XRP Price Index to track trading across major U.S. crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken and Crypto.com, according to the filing documents. Currently, XRP has a circulating supply of 57.81 billion tokens out of a maximum supply of 100 billion.The wave of spot crypto ETF applications would reshape the investment landscape for digital assets, with the SEC now processing multiple filings for products tied to XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

He has had a knack for picking winners ever since and made a fortune on early investments in companies like Instagram and Uber (NYSE: UBER).Today, he is the head honcho at the Lowercarbon Capital Fund and Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $1.2 billion in 2021. As is the case with many successful investors, Chris' interest in investing was sparked by the mentorship of a family friend.

Haas was also an investor, and he showed Sacca his computer trading account. Sacca was immediately fascinated and Haas sweetened the pot with an interesting proposition. He offered to pay for Sacca to make one trade and eat the loss if it didn't work but split the profits if Sacca's trade made money.Sacca said Haas summed up the deal by explaining, \"That's called venture capital.\" At the time, neither Sacca nor his parents had any experience investing, so Haas gave him one week to do market research and figure out what trade he wanted to make. It would be an understatement to say Sacca took his first stab at being an investment analyst seriously.Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?He told the podcast, I went to the library, I started learning about Stochastics, about charts, and technical analysis. I went all in. I read everything. I studied everything. He eventually settled on commodities and discovered an opportunity in live hog futures that piqued his interest. Sacca made the trade and it was a winner. He pocketed $171 in profits, which was a lot more than the $4.25/hour Haas paid him for manual labor.He recalled being amazed that he could make that kind of money \"by pushing a button and using my brain.

Sacca completed his education in 2000 with a law degree from Georgetown University and then got a job working as an in-house attorney for Google. He continued his penchant for making great deals by becoming an early investor in Twitter.After that, Sacca started his own venture capital firm, Lowercase Capital, and made early investments in a string of successful startups that included Kickstarter, Uber, and Stripe.

        "content": "By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Joanna PlucinskaCHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Airlines are flexing their pricing power as limited capacity and strong consumer demand have eased pressure to discount fares to fill their planes.The rising fares have bolstered the outlook for carriers on both sides of the Atlantic. Major U.S. airlines including Delta, Alaska and United have forecast bumper profits this year. Earnings at most European airlines are expected to improve as well.Airfares in the United States rose at their fastest pace in 21 months in December from a year ago, data from the Department of Labor shows. In Europe, airline ticket prices were up 6% year-on-year in 2024, according to data from travel research group ForwardKeys.Global airlines body IATA has forecast about a 15% year-on-year jump in net profit per passenger for North American airlines in 2025. European carriers are estimated to reap a 12% annual increase in net profit per passenger.Rising fares are a reflection of enforced capacity discipline as a shortage of planes due to production and engine delays has put a cap on the industry's growth plans.Aircraft deliveries from Boeing and Airbus have been slow due to supply-chain challenges. And ongoing inspections of RTX's Pratt & Whitney GTF (geared turbofan) engines have forced airlines to ground a number of jets.In Europe, carriers have 10% of their fleet inactive due to maintenance and repair issues, according to travel data firm OAG. Turkish Airlines - which has about 17% of its fleet out of service - has slashed its capacity by 19% in the current quarter from a year ago, leading to a 25% jump in its average fares.Ryanair last month reported better-than-expected profit in the December quarter on improved pricing power. CEO Michael O'Leary said constrained capacity in Europe could boost summer fares.Analysts at Bernstein estimate annual capacity growth at European carriers is undershooting travel demand growth by a wide margin. They called it \"the most encouraging industry setup in decades.\"INCREASED FOCUS ON PROFITABILITYEuropean airlines are hoping for a better 2025 after 2024 was marred by spiraling costs and geopolitical instability.John Grant, senior analyst at OAG, said higher ticket prices would translate into improved results for most European airlines in the March quarter, which historically has been their weakest quarter.\"Most airlines have increased their average selling fares,\" Grant said.In the United States, a shift in focus away from market share to profitability has prompted carriers to aggressively reduce their growth plans. This marks a reversal from last summer when an excess supply of seats in the price-sensitive end of the market sparked an airfare war, hurting earnings.As a result, annual domestic seat growth this year is estimated to be the slowest in at least a decade. United's CEO, Scott Kirby, last month said the pullback in flying by U.S. carriers was here to stay.\"The industry is evolving into an equilibrium where each airline, driven by economic necessity, will be primarily focused on flying where they have a competitive advantage,\" Kirby told investors.TARIFFS A 'MACRO WILDCARD'There is little evidence that higher costs of travel are taking a toll on consumer demand. Air tickets sold through U.S. travel agencies in December were up 17% from a year ago, data from Airlines Reporting Corp shows, with average ticket prices up 4% from a year ago.U.S. airline executives say households with earnings of $100,000, which account for 75% of air-travel spending, are doing well and continue to splurge on travel.\"People want to travel,\" Alaska Air's chief financial officer, Shane Tackett, said in an interview. \"They're still prioritizing experiences with their budgets.\"Higher ticket prices helped the six largest U.S. airlines expand their margins on average by about 337 basis points in the December quarter.The higher prices and increased profitability have fueled a rally in U.S. airline stocks. The NYSE Arca Airline index has gained 51% in the past six months, outpacing a 13% jump in the S&P 500 index. United Airlines' stock has surged about 155% during the same period.The situation could change if growing risks of a multi-front trade war make travelers tighten their purse strings. Economists have warned that President Donald Trump's tariffs could slow growth and fuel inflation.Daniel McKenzie, an analyst at Seaport Research Partners, said tariffs in the longer term are a \"macro wildcard\" for the industry.\"Trade wars are bad for demand,\" he said.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Joanna Plucinska in London; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back around 0.5%, after a winning day on Wall Street.The tone is cautious in the wait for Trump to reveal his plan for universal like-for-like tariffs, promised for announcement midweek. The president on Monday imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from March 12, according to executive orders. That puts further pressure on top trading partners Canada and Mexico.Investors are trying to gauge how far Trump's tariff threats will translate into action, as they worry about the impact of a trade war on corporate earnings, the global economy, and on inflation in particular. Gold (GC=F) set a fresh record as investors sought shelter from the uncertainty, before retreating on Tuesday.Amid those concerns, markets are looking to Powell's two-day testimony in Congress, starting Tuesday in the Senate, for any hint to the Fed's thinking about how tariffs could impact pricing pressures. Meanwhile, the countdown is on for January's Consumer Price Index reading on Wednesday and its wholesale counterpart on Thursday, as inflation stays persistent.On the earnings front, Coca-Cola (KO) shares rose after it beat estimates for fourth quarter profit and revenue as soda demand stayed robust amid price increases. Shopify's (SHOP) stock bounced back from pre-market losses after the e-commerce company reported a downbeat first quarter profit forecast with better-than-expected holiday sales.Meanwhile, an Elon Musk-led bid to buy OpenAI captured Wall Street's attention as AI spending fears continue to weigh on the Magnificent Seven. The AI nonprofit's CEO Sam Altman shot down the unsolicited offer of $97.4 billion, a significant undershoot of its valuation.Elsewhere in tech, Meta (META) began to lay off workers as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pledge to cut thousands of jobs in a pivot to finding AI talent.US stocks opened lower on Tuesday with tariff uncertainty top of mind for investors as traders also looked ahead to testimony from Federal Chair Jerome Powell on deck later this morning.Shortly after the opening bell, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved around 0.3% lower, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also dropped roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back around 0.5%, after a winning day on Wall Street.Oil futures rose 1.4% on Tuesday, on track for a third day of gains as investors assessed signs that US sanctions on Russian crude are putting a dent in the major producer's output.Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark, climbed to just below $77 a barrel, after closing 1.6% higher on Monday. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) moved up to $73.35 per barrel.Russia's oil production fell in January to further below its OPEC+ quota, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, its crude supplies are being offered to Chinese buyers at deeper discount as the US sanctions bed in, it said.The signs of faltering Russian supply appeared to eclipse market worries about the impact on the global economy of Trump's tariff overhaul, which promise to crimp demand.President Trump's unexpected policy moves are unsettling expectations at big financial institutions, David Hollerith reports:Dealmaking had its slowest month in January in more than a decade. A prized tax break for hedge funds and private equity firms came under threat. And big banks got grilled over whether they \"debanked\" certain customers.These complications were not part of the plan when Donald Trump was elected in November, an event that set off a round of optimistic predictions about an M&A boom, looser rules and a more favorable approach to big Wall Street firms in Washington, DC.Instead, bankers ended January with the lowest number of announced M&A deals within the US since that same month in 2014, according to LSEG data.Trumps new antitrust cops also signaled in the administrations second week that they werent going to give a free pass to big mergers by blocking a potential union between Hewlett Packard (HPE) and rival Juniper Networks (JNPR).And new uncertainties surrounding the presidents tariff plans are leaving many businesses unsure about when to make big moves and what direction borrowing costs might take in the weeks and months ahead.Read more here.Economic data: NFIB small business optimism (January)Earnings: BP (BP), Coca-Cola (KO), DoorDash (DASH), Humana (HUM), Lyft (LYFT), Marriott International (MAR), Shopify (SHOP), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Upstart (UPST), Zillow Group (Z)Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:The start of Trump 2.0 is not quite what Wall Street expectedAltman says 'no thank you' to Musk's $97.4 billion bid for OpenAIGold bumps to a record as US tariffs spur haven demandTrump's like-for-like tariffs could hit some US allies hardBYD starts new EV price war with free smart-driving systemThe most important number for the stock market right nowElliott builds over $2.5 billion stake in Phillips 66Stock indexes in Asia fell on Tuesday as investors warily assessed the impact of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum, while Chinese carmaker shares slid.Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped over 1%, while the CSI 300 (000300.SS) in Shanghai Shenzen fell X%, both gauges reversing course after rising for several sessions.The Sensex (^BSESN) in Bombay tumbled 1.3% amid concerns over the impact of the new 25% tariff on the primary aluminum producer's exports to the US.On the corporate front, shares of Chinese automakers Xpeng (9868.HK, XPEV) and Geely Auto (0175.HK, GELYF, GELYY) tumbled in Hong Kong, down 9% and 10% respectively.The moves came after China's BYD (1211.HK, BYDDY) launched free smart-driving features across most of its lineup, intensifying a regional EV price war and briefly lifting its share price to a record high. At the same time, fresh data showed Chinese car sales posted their biggest drop in almost a year in January.Gold (GC=F) continues to reap the benefits of uncertainty in stock markets. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum have pushed the safe-haven asset back to an all-time high for the second consecutive week.Bullion touched an all-time peak above $2,921 an ounce, maintaining momentum from a 1.7% boost in the day's session prior.Bloomberg reports:The precious metal has rallied 11% this year, setting a series of records, as Trumps disruptive moves on trade and geopolitics reinforce its role as a store of value in uncertain times. Markets are also trying to get a read on the potential implications for the US economy and monetary policy if the White Houses policies reignite inflation and subdue growth.Investors will be focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powells testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for clues about the monetary policy trajectory. Short-term inflation expectations have risen above longer-term ones to the widest gap since 2023, with the so-called five-year breakeven rate reaching 2.64% on Monday. That may support the case for a slower pace of easing, a scenario that, in theory, would be bearish for bullion since it pays no interest.Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,919.23 an ounce as of 7:50 a.m. in Singapore. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index added 0.1% after climbing 0.2% on Monday. Silver and platinum edged higher, while palladium dipped."

        "content": "If you want to get anywhere, you're going to need fuel. Humans need to eat, cars need gasoline, and stocks need institutional investors.Looking for breakouts on above average volume, at least 40%, is the easiest way to check for institutional support. But institutional investors do not purchase all their shares in one sitting. To give their portfolios the exposure they want, they will spread the buying across multiple days and weeks. In this way, they avoid driving up the price too high too quickly. So how do we track down and measure this drawn out spending?With a few exceptions, the individual investor simply lacks the buying power it takes to drive a stock into new high ground. When big investors such as mutual funds, banks and insurance companies start buying, you can see it in the trading volume.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is one of IBD's SmartSelect Ratings. The A/D Rating measures the amount of institutional buying and selling in a stock over the past three months. Using a proprietary formula, stocks are rated on an A+ to E scale. A+ means heavy institutional buying; E indicates heavy institutional selling. Naturally, heavy-volume up days help the rating, while heavy-volume down days hurt it.The up/down volume ratio is another good way to identify winning stocks under accumulation. The ratio covers 50 days of trading. It divides the total volume on up days by total volume on down days to get the ratio. Look for stocks with ratios above 1.0. A ratio above 1.0 points to heavier demand, or more buying, while a ratio below 1.0 suggests more selling.Like the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, heavy-volume gains and low-volume declines help improve the up/down volume ratio. Heavy-volume declines and low-volume gains will hurt the ratio.The up/down volume ratio is available in the Technical Performance section of IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com. The ratio is also found in MarketSurge weekly charts and on IBD Leaderboard charts.The accompanying table from January 2025 shows several leading stocks with high up/down volume ratios.At the end of last July, F5 (FFIV) jumped 12% on earnings. As strong as this move was, it was still within 5% of the 16-week cup buy point of 196.35. Shares held the 21-day line for five weeks creating a flat base. By Sept. 12, the day before the breakout, F5 held an up/down volume ratio of 2.5. Shares popped 2.1% the next day and began running, culminating in 20% gains just after Q3 earnings came out.Carpenter Technology (CRS) had a good 2024. In the last 12 months, shares have run up over 220%. Investors could have nabbed some of these gains for themselves in mid-July. Shares of the specialty metals manufacturer and distributor consolidated after Q3 earnings reported in May. A little over two weeks before Q4 earnings were delivered, Carpenter broke out at 112.75. It had an up/down volume ratio of 1.9 the day before it began to run 32% in just three weeks.Spotify Technology (SPOT) started 2024 with a bang. On Jan. 11, 2024, Spotify had an up/down volume ratio of 1.9 before breaking out of a five-week flat base. More-cautious investors could have waited until Jan. 24 to buy their shares. Spotify stock was still within the 5% buy zone and had a ratio of 2.1. Shares ran up 50% before they ever crossed below the 21-day line.This article was originally published Aug. 11, 2023, and has been updated."

        "content": "By Forrest Crellin and Elizabeth HowcroftPARIS (Reuters) - The time needed to connect power-hungry data centres to the electricity grid could blunt France's advantage using its abundant nuclear power to lure billions of dollars of investment into artificial intelligence, investors and experts said.Hosting a global summit on AI this week, French President Emmanuel Macron credited the country's reliable and clean nuclear power with helping attract more than 100 billion euros ($103.26 billion) in AI investments as Europe races to catch up with the United States, the global leader.Among the pledges was a $10 billion facility for a supercomputer operated by UK-based Fluidstack that will eventually need 1 gigawatt (GW) of power, roughly the amount generated by one of France's smaller nuclear reactors.Asset manager Brookfield said it would spend 20 billion euros on AI infrastructure in France, including data centres.With 57 nuclear reactors, France produces more than two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power. Last year, it exported a record amount, about 17% of its production, mostly to Italy.Data centres would lift demand for power, following a slump in industrial consumption after Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered soaring energy prices.However, planned data centres could still be years away, experts said, with burdensome permitting and construction procedures hampering a quick buildout.\"The countries that have the electricity supply ... (which is) sustainable and affordable, they are one step ahead of the others,\" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, told global leaders and tech executives attending the summit on Tuesday.\"But the problem is the following ... a data centre you build in less than one year, but the transmission lines for electricity you need about five years to build.\"'NUTS AND BOLTS'Construction in Europe is especially slow, said Anj Midha, general partner at U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\"The nuts and bolts of actually assembling the data centres in time, running the cables, sort of the ground logistics of this all require a level of permitting and construction acceleration that the U.S. is far ahead on,\" he told Reuters on the sidelines of the AI summit.In an effort to speed up the process, state-owned utility EDF said on Monday it had identified four sites on its own land for data centres, with grid connections already in place, and total available power of about 2 GW.\"This will reduce the time needed to complete projects by several years,\" it said in a statement.EDF said in November that it was in talks with three companies to power their 1 GW data centre projects in France, but cautioned that the projects could take years to complete, slowed down by the cost and public consultation required to build new high-voltage power lines.($1 = 0.9684 euros)(Reporting by Forrest Crellin and Elizabeth Howcroft; Writing by Dominique Patton; Editing by Aidan Lewis)"

        "content": "By Patrick Wingrove and Mariam Sunny(Reuters) -Moderna said on Friday that the U.S. FDA paused a late-stage trial of its experimental norovirus vaccine after a case of a rare neurological side effect was reported.The trial of the vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1403, was put on clinical hold following a single adverse event report of a case of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is currently under investigation, Moderna said.A Moderna executive said during a conference call that the case of Guillain-Barre was reported relatively soon after the vaccine's administration, although it was difficult to determine a causal relationship between the two.\"The FDA needs time to review the materials we submitted and they may come back with questions,\" an executive said.The company said enrollment for the norovirus vaccine trial had been completed in the Northern Hemisphere and that it does not expect delays in Southern Hemisphere enrollment.Moderna has been banking on revenue from newer mRNA shots to make up for waning post-pandemic demand for COVID-19 vaccines and less-than-expected uptake of its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, which sent shares down nearly 60% last year.Shares of Moderna, along with other vaccine makers, dropped further this year as lawmakers advanced U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy through Congress. Kennedy, an outspoken vaccine critic, was confirmed to the role on Thursday.Moderna's total revenue for the fourth quarter fell nearly 66% to $966 million, but beat analysts' expectations of $942.84 million. Most of those sales were generated by the COVID shot, which brought $923 million, compared to $15 million for its RSV vaccine.Despite the clinical hold, Moderna shares were up more than 4% at $33.31 in afternoon trading, far below its 52-week high of around $170 and pandemic all-time high of over $484.The vaccine maker said in January it would slash cash costs by $1 billion, as well as by an additional $500 million in 2026.\"We saw appropriate reductions and... evidence of Moderna beginning to cut costs to be able to manage a lower revenue line more appropriately,\" Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen said.The company reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss of $2.91 per share, compared to analysts' expectations of a $2.68 per share loss, according to LSEG data. It posted a profit of 55 cents per share last year.Finance chief James Mock in an interview attributed the loss to a $238 million non-cash charge related to the termination of its agreement with a contract manufacturer.\"As we looked at our manufacturing footprint, we believed we did not need that particular (manufacturer) and tried to eliminate the potential waste related to that capacity,\" he said, declining to identify the manufacturer.Moderna first announced it would scale down manufacturing of its Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine in late 2023, including at contract drug manufacturer Lonza's facility in Switzerland, as part of an effort that reduced cost of sales by $3.2 billion last year.Mock said on the call that the company believed the COVID market would remain durable over time and there was still long-term opportunity to expand its RSV market.Moderna reiterated its full-year 2025 product sales forecast of $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, most expected in the second half of the year.(Reporting by Mariam Sunny and Christy Santhosh in Bengaluru, and Patrick Wingrove in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Nia Williams and Bill Berkrot)"

        "source": "Reuters",
        "content": "By Yadarisa Shabong and Richa Naidu(Reuters) -Ben & Jerry's maker Unilever has chosen Amsterdam over London and New York as the primary listing for its ice cream business, it said on Thursday after announcing full-year earnings which underwhelmed investors.Unilever, whose other brands include Hellman's mayonnaise and Dove soap, also said that it expected a slower start to 2025 due to subdued market growth in the near term. The warning led to a near 7% drop in its shares, wiping around 8.5 billion pounds off its market value.Tineke Frikkee, a portfolio manager at Waverton Investment Management, a Unilever investor, said Thursday's decline in shares was down to a lack of positive momentum for the first half of 2025 and a risk quarterly forecasts will not be met.Unilever reported fourth-quarter underlying sales growth of 4% on Thursday, compared with a 4.1% forecast by analysts in a company-compiled poll. It also forecast 2025 underlying sales growth to be within its multi-year range of 3% to 5%.Chief Executive Hein Schumacher had laid out cost cuts at the company last year, including separating the ice cream division through a demerger and cutting thousands of jobs to address years of underperformance.The ice cream business, which includes five of the world's top 10 brands including Magnum and Wall's, will have secondary listings in London and New York. It generated turnover of 8.3 billion euros ($8.6 billion) in 2024.The decision to list in Amsterdam will likely be a blow to British finance minister Rachel Reeves, who met executives from Unilever last September. The official register of meetings described it as a discussion on investment in the United Kingdom and capital markets and reforms.In the Netherlands, Dirk Beljaarts, the minister of economic affairs, said the decision by Unilever confirmed the company's \"confidence in the Netherlands and underscores the competitiveness and attractiveness of our business climate\".It would have been difficult for Reeves to woo Unilever given it had made commitments to the Dutch government back in 2020 that it would choose the Netherlands if it ever planned to spin off its food and refreshment business. Unilever had picked London as its main stock listing and tax venue when it simplified its dual legal structure.BEN & JERRY'SThe listing might be complicated by Unilever's increasingly contentious relationship with the independent board of Ben & Jerry's, which ratcheted up a censorship lawsuit against Unilever last month.It accused its parent company of suppressing a social policy statement the U.S. ice cream maker wanted to release because it mentioned President Donald Trump.The brand and Unilever have been publicly at odds since 2021 when Ben & Jerry's decided to stop selling Cherry Garcia, Chubby Hubby and other ice cream flavours in the Israeli-occupied West Bank because it said it was inconsistent with the company's values.Schumacher said he did not believe the Ben & Jerry's litigation would stand in the way of the Amsterdam IPO.A demerger of the business had been the most likely option, Barclays analysts said, as such assets in consumer staples often perform well because they are pure plays.Consumer health firm Haleon, spun out from drugmaker GSK in 2022, has seen its market value grow by about 5 billion pounds to 35.4 billion pounds since its listing.Jean-Francois van Boxmeer has been appointed chair designate for the separated ice cream business, Unilever said.MORE WORK TO DOBritain's business minister Jonathan Reynolds told reporters that the government had more work to do to attract stock market listings in addition to reforms last year and other measures taken by the London Stock Exchange.It is still hoping to attract online fast-fashion retailer Shein, which Reuters has reported is expected to list in London for $50 billion.UK officials implemented listing reforms last year aimed at helping London compete with New York and the European Union following Brexit, but the changes have yet to yield a noticeable turnaround in initial public offerings amid a long spell of outflows from UK funds.Equipment rental firm Ashtead Group, for instance, announced plans in December to shift its listing to New York, where many companies believe they can get a higher valuation.($1 = 0.9584 euros)(Reporting by Yadarisa Shabong in Bengaluru and Richa Naidu in London; Additional reporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam, and Paul Sandle and Kate Holton in London; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips, Bernadette Baum and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"

As of Wednesday morning, traders were pricing just one interest-rate cut, after pricing in two for most of the year. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added 11 basis points to hit 4.64% following the inflation data.Meanwhile, markets are on alert for more policy surprises from Trump, who is expected to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries before the end of the week.A fresh batch of earnings provided some clues to Corporate America's resilience.

The health care benefits segment, which includes its various insurance products, was down slightly, with ongoing Medicare and Medicaid headwinds, which have also impacted its peers, dragging the company's revenue.Still its retail pharmaceutical business, at a time when the business model is struggling, increased, as well as the health care services segment.When asked directly about President Trump's tariffs and how they could impact the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path, Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted it's rather unclear.As he did during a Jan. 29 press conference, Powell stressed there is increased uncertainty right now as the Fed waits to hear what exactly happens with Trump's policy. He added that while tariffs could impact the economic outlook and cause the Fed to change its monetary policy plans, the central bank is also watching immigration, fiscal policy, and regulatory policy.Powell said they can't assess how any of those factors will impact the economic outlook until it's clear what policies are actually being put into place.For now, Powell said Wednesday's January CPI reading showed similar signs to what the Fed has been seeing.Powell said inflation is \"close\" to the Fed's 2% goal but \"we're not there yet.\"Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:Donald Trump on Wednesday morning dismissed a higher-than-expected inflation report as \"Biden inflation\" after making another call to lower interest rates.The US president reacted to the release of the data showing headline consumer prices rose more than forecast by posting BIDEN INFLATION UP! on Truth Social.The post came just an hour after another post earlier Wednesday morning that read \"Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!\"Read more here.Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:A hotter-than-expected inflation reading at the start of 2025 makes it much more likely that the Federal Reserve will keep rates on hold for the foreseeable future, reinforcing a cautionary stance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bank policymakers.After the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose more than forecast in January, traders reduced their expectations for rate cuts in 2025 to just one  and not until much later in the year.\"It really does push the timeline into the second half of the year if things go well,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Fed economist, told Yahoo Finance.Read more here.US stocks fell on Wednesday as investors digested a hotter-than-expected January consumer inflation reading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all off about 1%.New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics out Wednesday showed that a key inflation metric rose more than anticipated in January.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.4% over the prior month, an acceleration from December's 0.2% monthly gain and above the 0.3% economists had expected. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.3%, above the 3.1% economists had projected.Headline consumer prices also rose more than expected. The CPI increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices.

KKR is also an interested party, two of the sources said, adding that a deal is not guaranteed and Trend Micro could choose to remain independent.Trend Micro shares shot up by their daily trade limit of 1,500 yen, or 16.05%, to close at 10,860 yen in Tokyo on Thursday - their highest closing level since March 2000 - after Reuters reported the buyout interest from private equity firms.The stock was the biggest percentage gainer among the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.A successful takeover of Trend Micro would rank as one of the world's biggest leveraged buyouts in recent months and signal that private equity dealmaking is starting to bounce back, after the pace of debt-fueled buyouts was hit hard by interest rate hikes from central banks to fight inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic.Trend Micro has been exploring a sale since the company received acquisition interest last year, Reuters previously reported.Trend Micro did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bain, EQT, KKR and Advent declined to comment.Founded in 1988 by technology industry executives Steve Chang, Jenny Chang and Eva Chen as an antivirus software maker, Trend Micro has expanded its offerings to cloud computing, network and endpoint security.In November, Trend Micro said third-quarter net sales rose 6% to 68.1 billion yen for a 42% jump in operating income to 14.8 billion yen, as its operating margin rose to 24%.The company's large U.S. rivals include Crowdstrike, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks and McAfee.Cybersecurity deal activity has been robust in recent years as large corporations have ramped up spending on security tools. Increased competition among all-in-one cyber platforms has shaken up the industry, making some companies attractive takeover targets for larger rivals and private equity firms.Last year, Google parent Alphabet attempted to acquire Wiz for $23 billion before the talks fizzled out.

The targeted size for the IPO launch is being reported for the first time.Eneos said it has no comment beyond what it has already announced. Japan Exchange Group, which owns the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said it cannot comment on individual companies.Eneos shares were up 1% following the report compared with a flat broader Japanese market.At that size, JXAM's IPO would surpass subway operator Tokyo Metro's offering of last year, according to LSEG data, and be the largest listing in Japan since SoftBank's telecoms unit went public in late 2018.Almost $6.2 billion was raised in IPOs by 87 companies in Japan last year, the largest sum since 2021, according to LSEG data.Eneos applied in October to list the metals unit as the refiner aims to optimise its portfolio and focus on growth areas.JXAM is a leading manufacturer of sputtering targets, which are materials used to create thin metal films during chip production.The unit's semiconductor materials segment contributed around a third of its 81 billion yen operating income in the last financial year.JXAM has invested in a new plant for manufacturing sputtering targets in Arizona.($1 = 153.3700 yen)(Reporting by Miho Uranaka and Sam Nussey; Additional reporting by Yuka Obayashi and Noriyuki Hirata; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"

        "published": "2025-02-12T15:59:47Z",
        "source": "Associated Press Finance",
        "content": "A growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.The changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media, and more recently, President Donald Trump's executive orders aimed at upending DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector. DEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks.While hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. Instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.These are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI:Goldman SachsInvestment firm Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced IPO clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy, said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in an email to The Associated Press. We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.Goldman Sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards.GoogleGoogle rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company's leadership team by 30% within five years. In a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to Trump's executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting DEI practices that constitute illegal discrimination.Google's parent company Alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.TargetThe retailer said that changes to its Belonging at the Bullseye strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyds death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.Target also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure theyre connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.Meta PlatformsThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.Like other companies that announced similar changes before Meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program since the Supreme Courts July 2023 ruling upending affirmative action in higher education.Citing an internal memo sent to employees, news website Axios reported the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background. The change means the company will also end its diverse slate approach to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.AmazonAmazon said it was halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been winding down outdated programs and materials, and were aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.We also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that dont align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But well keep at it, she wrote.Rather than have individual groups build programs, Castleberry said, Amazon is focusing on programs with proven outcomes  and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.McDonaldsFour years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks, McDonalds said earlier this month that it is ending some of its diversity practices.McDonalds said on Jan. 6 that it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.McDonalds said it will also pause external surveys. The burger giant didnt elaborate, but several other companies have suspended their participation in an annual survey by the HRC.In an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonalds senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage.WalmartThe worlds largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment to a racial equity center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRCs Corporate Equality Index.Walmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.Additionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it wont be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.FordCEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automakers employees in August outlining changes to the companys DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRCs Corporate Equality Index.Ford, he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesnt use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remains committed to fostering a safe and inclusive workplace, Farley said.We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day, the memo said.LowesIn August, Lowes executive leadership said the company began reviewing its programs following the Supreme Courts affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.The retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.Harley-DavidsonIn a post on X in August, Harley-Davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. It said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.The motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the HRC, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.Harley-Davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.Brown-FormanThe parent company of Jack Daniels also pulled out from participating in the HRCs Corporate Equality Index, among other changes. Its leaders sent an email to employees in August saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then the world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.The company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.Brown-Forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work, spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway said in an email.John DeereThe farm equipment maker said in July that it would no longer sponsor social or cultural awareness events, and that it would audit all training materials to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages in compliance with federal and local laws.Moline, Illinois-based John Deere added the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy. But it noted that it would still continue to track and advance the diversity of the company.Tractor SupplyThe retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.Tractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would stop sponsoring non-business activities such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns  and no longer submit data for the HRC index.The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead focus on our land and water conservation efforts.The National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supplys president and CEO to step down shortly after the companys announcement."

        "content": "Its been a great time to be a goldbug. Whether investors are bullish on the precious metal as a financial asset because theyre skeptical of fiat currency, worried about a broader economic collapse, or have other motivations, the spot price of gold has climbed more than 40% in the past 12 months, doubling the S&P 500s gain during that span. No one officially holds more of the yellow metal than the U.S. government, however, and a simple accounting change could result in a roughly $750 billion windfall on the countrys balance sheet.According to the governments financial statements, the U.S. owns about 261.6 million troy ounces, or almost 8,200 metric tons, of gold. Those reserves are currently valued at a set rate of $42.22 an ounce, or around where the metals price sat in the early 1970s, producing a book value of $11 billion. At golds current spot price of about $2,920 per ounce, however, the market value of those holdings is nearly $765 billion.Theres debate about whether that bookkeeping change would have any true impact. Nonetheless, as Gillian Tett wrote in the Financial Times last week, speculation about such a move has picked up as new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tries to implement President Donald Trumps economic vision for America without spooking markets.Were going to monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people, Bessent said last Monday, when Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of a sovereign wealth fund. Were going to put the assets to work, and I think its going to be very exciting.The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment, but the definition of monetization means changing something into money, or at least expressing the asset in terms of a currency. So, what would an additional $750 billion do for the U.S government? Not much, said Jay Hatfield, the CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, which manages ETFs and several hedge funds.For the mark-to-market change to have any impact, he said, the U.S. would presumably need to sell off some of its gold reserves for cash. It would be hard for the Treasury to do that without tanking the market for the precious metal.Its going to be like Armageddon if they try to dump any significant amount of gold, Hatfield said.Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist and commodities researcher at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, agrees such a sale would be difficult. Central bank buying, particularly by China, has helped drive golds surge since 2022. Massive sales by the U.S. would likely have the opposite effect.Still, talk of monetizing Americas gold reserves speaks to a difficult needle Bessent is trying to thread: addressing the countrys burgeoning deficit while funding Trumps fiscal ambitions. House Republicans are reportedly considering a tax and spending bill that would add $6.5 trillion to the federal debt, causing the growth of the countrys fiscal hole to double, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The governments interest payments already exceed spending on Medicare and defense.According to David Teeters, a professor at IESE Business School, a $750 billion mark-to-market gain would deleverage the governments balance sheet. In other words, the countrys borrowing as a percentage of its total assets would decrease, potentially giving Bessent some wiggle room.However, the Treasury secretary is also juggling contradictory goals as the Trump administration calls for a weaker dollar but simultaneously looks to bolster the greenbacks status as the worlds reserve currency. Tariffs, meanwhile, should not help on either front.Something has to give, Teeters, a former managing director in capital markets groups at both BNP Paribas and Barclays, wrote in a recent blog post.A race among nations to devalue their currencies doesnt seem very appealing.One alternative is a coordinated reset of the global monetary system that deleverages the system by devaluing all currencies against a neutral reserve asset, Teeters said. Alternatives include either gold, which has served this function for millennia, or millennials newfound preference for crypto: Bitcoin. Both are likely to benefit in 2025.The former sounds like good news for goldbugs.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

The attacker allegedly called him a capitalist swine before taking a swing, which Oneal described as a miserable punch.

He posted a video announcing that every time he sees another Cybertruck on the road, he'll leave a $1 bill and draw a heart on it, saying, \"I'm trying to spread the love.\" In the video, he placed two $1 bills and a heart drawn in grime on a parked Cybertruck and revealed $100 in singles ready for future encounters.While many on X supported Oneal's gesture, with one user saying, \"All this hate needs to stop,\" others found it amusing. Oneal joked, \"I guess I'm built like my Cybertruck.\"Trending: Many dont know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment  Heres how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big moveHowever, reactions on Reddit were more critical.

The company's shares plummeted more than 63% in 2024.Oaktree Capital Management's offer was first reported by the Australian Financial Review, which said the asset management firm had approached Star's lender syndicate including Westpac, Barclays and Washington H Soul Pattinson along with other investors, offering to acquire their debt at a discount.Star said it was considering the offer but provided no assurances the proposal would be accepted.If the proposal is accepted, it would result in the dilution of the shareholding of the casino operator's investors and make Oaktree a significant investor in the future. Oaktree was not immediately available for comment outside of business hours.Star has been urgently seeking to raise capital after expressing doubts last month about its viability due to a cash crunch. The company needs to raise A$150 million in subordinated debt to proceed with further A$100 million borrowings.The heavily-indebted gaming firm has been struggling amidst a crisis affecting Australian casino operators for years, with Star and larger rival Crown Resorts, owned by Blackstone, facing multiple regulatory inquiries, decreased tourist visits and long closures.The firm has repeatedly warned investors that conditions remain challenging for the company to continue operating.\"We would caution a significant rise in the Star's share price given that its currently very public dirty laundry would likely be a considerable liability for whomever purchases control of the group,\" said Jesse Moors, portfolio manager at Spatium Capital.\"Oaktree will likely be cognisant and aggressive in their negotiation of this; which may dilute current or new shareholders in Star.\"Star said several conditions must be met for Oaktree's offer to proceed, including a \"comprehensive\" security package, approvals from governments and regulators in New South Wales and Queensland, completion of due diligence and existing creditors entering a settlement and/or refinancing agreement on terms satisfactory to Oaktree.($1 = 1.5723 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Himanshi Akhand in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonali Paul and Jacqueline Wong)"

We look forward to continuing our work with our partners in Vietnam.Willis alternative risk transfer solutions MD Claire Wilkinson said: This programme supports the resilience of coffee farmers in Vietnam against the impacts of an increasingly volatile climate, giving them much-needed financial support and allowing them to recover quickly when adverse weather threatens their livelihoods.Willis Towers Watson (WTW) posted net income of $1.25bn (992.24m) for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase from $623m in the same quarter of 2023.However, for the full year of 2024, WTW registered a net loss of $88m, compared with a net income of $1.1bn in 2023.\"Willis, Global Parametrics offer parametric cover for Vietnam coffee farmers \" was originally created and published by Life Insurance International, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "content": "HanesBrands board of directors has started the process of finding a new CEO (chief executive) and has engaged the services of consultancy Spencer Stuart to assist in identifying suitable candidates for the role.The upcoming CEO transition comes as the company's quarterly and annual performance outpaced projected key indicators, signalling the effective implementation of its strategic reformation plan.Bratspies, the former Walmart executive, will also resign from the board when he steps down as CEO but will continue in an advisory capacity to ensure a seamless leadership transition.Board chairman Bill Simon said: \"We are actively searching for the next leader who will continue building on our momentum for the next chapter of the companys growth. We will provide updates as appropriate. On behalf of the entire board, we deeply appreciate the transformative leadership Steve has demonstrated throughout his tenure as CEO to make HanesBrands a new and better company.\"Steve led HanesBrands through a turbulent period in our industry, overhauling the companys operating model, completing the sale of the Champion business and positioning HanesBrands as a global powerhouse in basics and innerwear. Under Steves leadership, the company has narrowed its focus and is now on track to deliver even stronger performance and increased shareholder returns in the coming years.In the fourth quarter 2024, HanesBrands net sales from continuing operations was $888m, a 4.5% increase over the previous year.The company attributed the growth to cost-saving initiatives and reduced input costs which boosted gross profit by 14% to $390m and adjusted gross profit by 15% to $392m.Gross margin expanded by 380 basis points to 43.9% and adjusted gross margin by 400 basis points to 44.1%.During the quarter, HanesBrands' operating profit saw a 27% rise to $120m with operating margin up by 240 basis points to 13.5%. Its adjusted operating profit climbed by 33% to $126m.The companys income from continuing operations was $46m in Q4 FY24, down from $99m in the same period a year ago. Earnings per diluted share stood at $0.13 against $0.28 in Q4 FY23.The company noted that its fiscal year 2025 includes an extra week and ends on 3 January 2026. HanesBrands anticipates net sales from continuing operations between $3.47bn and $3.52bn, accounting for foreign currency exchange rate headwinds of about $60m.The midpoint forecast suggests sales consistent with the prior year on a reported basis and an approximate 1% increase on an organic constant currency basis.GAAP operating profit from continuing operations is projected to be between $420m and $440m, while adjusted operating profit is estimated between $450m and $465m after excluding restructuring charges of roughly $25m to $30m.For Q1 FY25 ending 29 March 2025, the company expects net sales from continuing operations of around $750m despite foreign currency exchange rate headwinds of about $15m.This represents an approximate 1% increase compared to the prior year on both a reported basis and an organic constant currency basis.Bratspies said: We enter 2025 as a new company. We are a more simplified, focused business with a powerful asset base and significant competitive advantages. We believe we are well positioned to build on the fourth quarters momentum and deliver positive sales growth, additional margin expansion, strong cash generation and continued debt reduction, providing us multiple levers to create additional shareholder value in 2025 and beyond.\"HanesBrands CEO to depart as Q4 2024 sales beat expectations \" was originally created and published by Just Style, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "published": "2025-02-17T11:20:51Z",
        "source": "FreightWaves",
        "content": "A rating action by Moodys on flatbed operator PS Logistics  a company that has made numerous acquisitions in that field in recent years  is noteworthy more for some of the information it reveals about the privately held business than for any change in its financial status.PS Logistics, the operating name for parent company Carriage Logistics, recently saw its debt ratings from Moodys (NYSE: MCO) hold steady across several different classifications.Its corporate family rating stayed steady at B2, which is five notches below the cutoff for investment-grade debt ratings. Its probability-of-default rating also held at B2.PS Logistics rating on its senior secured first lien loan was affirmed at B1, which is stronger than the B2 rating. Its rating on unsecured notes was affirmed at Caa1, two notches below the family rating.The B2 rating on PS reflects the companys position as one of the largest providers of flatbed transportation and logistics services, its solid operational track record through business cycles and adequate liquidity, Moodys said in its report. Further, the rating reflects the companys moderately high financial leverage, acquisitive financial policy and ongoing capital needs to enhance its fleet of trucks.The reference to PS Logistics as acquisitive was the only mention in the report of the fact that the company has made multiple purchases in recent months, buying Fluker Transportation in November, Yardy Transportation in March and the flatbed segment of ELS in January 2024. When PS Logistics announced the Fluker deal, it said in a prepared statement that it had acquired 27 trucking companies and five non-asset-based logistics companies since 2016.The affirmation of the existing ratings is in slight contrast to recent freight-related actions by Moodys, which have been distinctly bearish. They have been either ratings downgrades or more frequently, placement of companies on its negative watch, often a prelude to a downgrade.RXO (NYSE: RXO) got a negative outlook in March; chassis provider Trac Intermodal met the same fate; truck parts supplier Fleet Pride saw a move to a negative outlook; and Forward Airs turmoil last year led to downgrades by Moodys and the two other key ratings agencies  Fitch and S&P Global Ratings (NYSE: SPGI)  with the latter hitting the company twice.Debt ratings on privately held firms reveal significantly less financial data about the companies than quarterly earnings reports provide on publicly traded companies. But the Moodys report did reveal several things about PS Logistics.Its fleet comprises more than 4,500 trucks with more than 40 terminals throughout the U.S.In the 12 months ended Sept. 20, its revenue was about $1.6 billion. Debt rating reports do not generally release information on profitability. But the report said it expects profitability to improve this year.PS Logistics is expected by Moodys to be free-cash-flow-positive in 2025.Its fleet is described by Moodys as very young ... so we expect new truck purchases to moderate over the next year.The outlook on the company was listed as stable: Conditions do not suggest any basis for a ratings increase or decrease in the coming months. That is based not only on Moodys expectations for greater profitability but also on the projection that the companys ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will be around 5X by the end of the year. Its current level was not disclosed, but it was presumably higher than 5X.Moodys said there could be a ratings upgrade if the companys EBITA margin is sustained above 6% and the debt/EBITDA margin could be sustained below 4X. A downgrade could happen if debt/EBITA remains above 5X and the EBITDA margin drops below 4%. (EBITA is earnings before interest, taxes and amortization; EBITDA throws depreciation into that number. Moodys used both numbers in its analysis).PS Logistics has a $150 million asset-based lending facility that has not been touched and expires in September 2026.S&P has a B rating on PS Logistics, which is equivalent to the B2 rating of Moodys. The S&P Global rating has been in effect since September 2021.Moodys also said it will be watching the average age of the fleet. If that number significantly increases, it could result in higher operating costs or could be a sign that the company doesnt have the financial capacity to invest in its fleet.Despite the bearishness of Moodys freight-related actions in the past year, the ratings agency was moderately bullish, or at least not bearish, on PS Logistics prospects.We expect PS Logistics operating performance to moderately improve over the course of 2025. Lower trucking rates and softer volumes have weighed on PS Logistics earnings since 2023, the agency said. However, we expect rates to modestly increase in 2025 as excess trucking capacity continues to exit the market.The report also noted that PS Logistics driver pay structure is based on a percentage of freight rates, rather than the more prevalent per-mile approach. Moodys said that system creates a flexible cost structure and limits significant margin erosion during down markets. Further, it contributes to PS Logistics below average driver turnover levels.With tariffs looming large over all transportation sectors, Moodys said PS Logistics could be protected against some of the bigger impacts from the levies because we believe most of the freight PS Logistics transports is largely produced and used domestically. But overall, the impact and uncertainty of tariffs pose a risk to overall volumes and demand in these end markets.The bigger picture, Moodys said, is that the company is exposed to end market demand that correlates with cyclical industrial production and construction spending in the U.S.More articles by John KingstonFor the first time in years, C.H.

        "content": "(Reuters) -China's President Xi Jinping spoke on Monday at a symposium on private enterprises attended by tech entrepreneurs including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, state media said, but gave no specific details.Last week Reuters reported the symposium aims to boost private-sector sentiment, with Xi expected to encourage executives to expand their businesses despite a deepening China-U.S. tech war.Here are comments about the meeting:CHARLIE CHAI, A SHANGHAI-BASED ANALYST AT 86RESEARCH:\"We believe the event will likely be followed by concrete pro-technology policies. Potential moves include shifting focus from 'national security risks and social externalities' to a more risk-taking approach to technology application.\"(This would) include potentially accelerating the mass deployment of generative AI, autonomous driving, and humanoid robotics.\"Similarly, securities regulators are likely to adopt a more accommodative stance, allowing technology companies greater access to capital markets to finance growth, which could help resolve uncertainties around listing and re-listing timelines (e.g., Didi, Ant, Temu).\"ALFREDO MONTUFAR-HELU, HEAD OF THINK TANK THE CONFERENCE BOARD'S CHINA CENTER:\"That President Xi chaired this symposium signals a recognition from Chinas top party leadership of the significant role that Chinese private firms can play in the support of growth, and, more importantly, in realising the technological ambitions of China in the face of growing Western restrictions.\"\"We should expect more support to the private sector, especially in areas of strategic importance for the country.\"Despite their flaws, DeepSeek now, and Huaweis Kirin chip before, send a strong message to the West: that China not only has the intention but also resources and capacity to innovate its way out of technology restrictions, no matter how costly.\"FRED HU, FOUNDER & CHAIRMAN, PRIMAVERA CAPITAL GROUP, HONG KONG:\"President Xi's meeting with Chinese private entrepreneurs clearly represents a major course correction.\"The private sector, long the backbone of the Chinese economy and the most important growth engine, has been battered in recent years by mounting policy and regulatory uncertainties, with dire consequences to China's economy, and worse, to its labour market with rising youth unemployment.\"The leadership's well-publicised meeting with some of the country's most high-profile entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma, could not come at a more critical juncture.\"It should help reassure rattled entrepreneurs and lift up business and investor confidence in China.\"TOM NUNLIST, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT POLICY RESEARCH CONSULTANCY TRIVIUM CHINA:\"The tech crackdown has been definitively over for some time and the government has been trying to push increased confidence for the private sector, and tech sector, in particular.\"There's been some continued scepticism because at the end of the day it's Xi Jinping's opinion that matters most. You cannot do better than having Xi Jinping personally give the nod of approval.\"I think it took so long to have this meeting because Xi is changing course.\"XIAOYAN ZHANG, CHAIR PROFESSOR OF FINANCE, TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, BEIJING:\"I think the meetings purpose is to make sure that the private sector understands, for the stability and for the growth of the economy, they are a very important part of the economy.\"I think the purpose is to tell them, 'We want to support you. We need you to boost innovation, technological innovation, and we need you to boost consumption.' I think (the purpose is) to inject confidence in there.\"GARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR NATIXIS, HONG KONG:\"Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the United States.\"The market reads it as a positive signal to include Jack Ma in such a meeting and hope for the end of the tech crackdown. Still, the regulatory environment is the black box.\"As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.\"CHRISTOPHER BEDDOR, DEPUTY CHINA RESEARCH DIRECTOR, GAVEKAL DRAGONOMICS, HONG KONG:\"I think its a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the United States.\"Policymakers would probably prefer if industrial-policy planning and state-owned enterprises were able to make innovative breakthroughs at the technological frontier.\"But the disruptive innovations are coming from private-sector companies. The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the United States.\"His (Jack Ma's) presence would be hugely symbolic of how the governments stance towards the tech sector has changed. If theres one person associated with the tech crackdown, its Jack Ma.\"As for the signal  weve seen Xi run this playbook before. He clearly wants to send a message that the government is now supportive of the tech sector.\"Its more or less a total reversal of the policy stance from a few years ago.\"(Reporting by Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore newsrooms; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Clarence Fernandez)"

That's the fourth straight year of expansion.Private consumption grew at an annual rate of 0.5% during the three months through December, holding up while losing momentum. Exports jumped 4.3%, and capital investment increased 0.5%.The positive data sent Japans benchmark Nikkei 225 higher, as well as other Asian markets.Some analysts think the anticipation of President Donald Trumps tariffs may have lifted trade.Unlike the U.S. and some other nations, Japan has been dogged by deflation, and these lower prices stifle growth. But recent wage growth has kept deflationary trends in check.Recent data show inflation is at about the Bank of Japans target of 2%. Higher prices are crimping consumer spending, which makes up for more than half the economy.The central bank may move to further raise interest rates, which were at zero or below zero for years to wrest the economy out of deflation. It raised its key interest rate to about 0.5% from 0.25% last month, noting that inflation is holding at a desirable target level. The next monetary policy meeting is in March.Stronger growth may reinforce expectations for the Bank of Japan to push through with further hikes, while the slowdown in private consumption growth may be addressed by the prospects of higher wages ahead, said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG."

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.It's been a mostly upbeat start to the week for Asian shares, even though a holiday in U.S. markets has thinned liquidity. Hong Kong led the way again, tacking another 1.4% onto last week's 7% jump amid optimism about potential low-cost AI adoption following the DeepSeek reveal.Goldman Sachs has raised its outlookfor Chinese growth and stocks, arguing that widespread adoption of AI could raise earnings per share by 2.5% a year over the next decade. It would also lift the fair value of Chinese equity by 15% to 20% and attract $200 billion of fund inflows.The rush has been led by a 24% jump in Alibaba on news it would partner with Apple to support iPhones' artificial intelligence services offering in China. Alibaba reports earnings on Thursday and options imply the share could move 7.5% in either direction on the results.The pan-European STOXX 600 index has also been attracting global funds, having climbed for eight straight weeks and up 8% since the turn of the year. EUROSTOXX 50 futures and DAX futures were both a fraction higher on Monday.Japan's Nikkei has been muted by a rising yen, which offset news of a strong 2.8% rise in annualised economic growth for the fourth quarter. Oddly, markets still only imply a minor chance of the Bank of Japan hiking again in March, presumably because that will be before the main round of wage negotiations is finished.Even a May move is only priced at a one-in-four chance, which seems far too low given the run of data and the BOJ's hawkish commentary.The GDP surprise did help the yen push up to 151.55 per dollar. The U.S. currency has been on the back foot since a surprisingly weak January retail sales report challenged the whole economic \"exceptionalism\" meme.Markets are back to wagering on two Fed rate cuts this year rather than one, with a move in June better than 50-50.Central banks in Australia and New Zealand hold policy meetings this week and are both expected to cut interest rates, the former by 25 basis points and the latter by twice that.Geopolitics remained in focus with reports that talks on the Russia-Ukraine conflict will begin in Saudi Arabia this week, though the participants are not entirely clear.French President Emmanuel Macron will host an emergency European summit on Monday after U.S. officials suggested Europe would have no role in ending the conflict, a peace process that will seemingly be conducted between the U.S. and Russia.Key developments that could influence markets on Monday:- Eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels- Appearances by Fed Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker and Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman(By Wayne Cole; Editing by Edmund Klamann)"

The CoinDesk 20 Index rose 5.7% over the same period, and the broader MarketVector Digital Assets 100 Index (MVDA) rose 3.4%.The precious metal saw its price drop amid growing speculation that the new tariffs threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump are meant to be a negotiating tool. This hit the price of safe-haven assets, including the commodity and the U.S. dollar.Trump announced reciprocal tariffs were on the table to match the tariff imposed by other countries on U.S. imports. Reciprocal tariffs could take months to implement, leading to speculation these are meant to allow the U.S. to negotiate with other countries.However, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report, gold's recent dip could still present an opportunity for those looking for hedges amid global reflation, geopolitical tensions, and growing fiscal spending. Wall Street giants have recently raised their gold price forecasts, which would also help the price of gold-backed digital assets rise as these are backed by bullion stored in vaults.Citi strategists recently raised their short-term gold price target to $3,000 and their average forecast for the year to $2,900.

These are huge capesizes and that could further drag down prices,\" Vasudev Pamnani, director at India's I-Energy Natural Resources, said.\"More U.S. coal imports could have an impact on Australia,\" Pamnani told the Coaltrans India conference on Monday.In volume terms, the U.S. accounts for a small part of Chinese imports of coal, but the value of coking coal shipments - used mainly by steelmakers - rose by nearly a third to $1.84 billion in 2024.Malcolm Roberts, chief marketing officer at the biggest U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy, said on a conference call with analysts last week that more U.S. coal could go to India and more Australian coal to China as a result of the tariffs.Australia was the dominant coking coal supplier to India in the last decade, accounting for about 80% of all such shipments. Its share dwindled to 62% in 2024, as supplies from the United States as well as Russia and Mozambique helped India to diversify.Australia could now regain some share in China - its main market where it made up over two-thirds of coking coal imports before China announced an unofficial ban on such imports in 2021. Mongolia and Russia are currently the biggest exporters of coking coal to China.The U.S. accounted for 9% of the coking coal market in China in 2024, while Australia made up 8% of all such imports, Chinese customs data shows.(Reporting by Sethuraman N R and Sudarshan Varadhan; editing by Barbara Lewis)"

        "content": "Everyone would love to make a million dollars through investing -- and there are various ways to set yourself off on the right path. One way is to invest in a broad range of quality stocks and hold on to them for the long term. Though this is something all of us can do, it requires some time and effort.Now, what if I told you that with just one investing move, you could invest in 500 of today's top stocks? This is one time when something that sounds too good to be true actually is true: By buying shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), you gain exposure to the biggest companies driving today's economy.A popular low-cost one to try is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). But will this Vanguard ETF make you a millionaire? Let's find out.First, let's talk a little bit about ETFs. These assets allow you to invest in many stocks at once according to a particular theme -- this could be by industry, such as biotech, or investment style, like value or growth. ETFs also are a great way to gain exposure to the performance of a major benchmark, such as the S&P 500. In this case, the fund mimics the composition of that index in order to track its performance, meaning that when the S&P 500 advanced 23% last year, so did the ETFs tracking it.So, by investing in an ETF, you gain immediate diversification across a theme, or in the case of an S&P 500 ETF, diversification beyond one industry or theme.And the great thing about ETFs is they trade daily on the market just like stocks, meaning you can buy or sell them just as you would a stock. The one main difference to be aware of is ETFs come with management fees, as expressed by an expense ratio -- you'll want to choose an ETF with an expense ratio of less than 1% in order to preserve your gains over time. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF fits the bill, with an expense ratio of only 0.03%.Now, let's talk specifically about the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. Today, this fund, like the index it tracks, is heavily exposed to technology -- an industry that's soared in recent times thanks to investor interest in areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.Information technology is the most heavily weighted sector in the index and fund at more than 32%. But, as mentioned, investing in such an ETF allows you to diversify, and here, we have exposure to a total of 11 industries.Another positive point is the index, and therefore the Vanguard fund too, are flexible. The index rebalances periodically to reflect the most relevant companies and sectors of the times, and the Vanguard fund must copy these additions and deletions.All of this ensures that you as an investor always are exposed to the top companies of the moment. For example, last year, the S&P 500 invited Palantir Technologies, an AI-driven software company that's seen earnings soar, to join -- and the Vanguard ETF added the shares.So, it's clear that an investment in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is a smart move -- but could it make you a millionaire? Let's do some quick math. The S&P 500 has generated an annual average return of 10% over time. If we imagine this continues and we invest $1,000 in the Vanguard ETF today, then add $300 a month to it for 35 years, the total value of our investment could top $1 million.This shows it is possible to reach $1 million by investing in the Vanguard S&P 500 over time -- but should you do it? I wouldn't put all of my eggs in one basket and invest only in one stock or one ETF -- even an ETF that tracks a solid benchmark. You're much more likely to score a victory by buying a variety of quality stocks and ETFs and holding on over time than sticking to just one.But, as part of a diversified portfolio, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF makes a fantastic investment -- and one that clearly could help you roar ahead on the road to wealth.Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasnt one of them.

        "content": "Meme stocks like AMC Entertainment (AMC) and GameStop (GME) get their price spikes from exceptional buying interest. But those sudden and sporadic gains are as unpredictable as they are risky.GameStop jumped on Monday, rebounding from the 200-day moving average. Shares rose after  GameStop Chief Executive Officer Ryan Cohen posted a picture of himself with MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor.MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin. The Twitter/X post set off speculation that GameStop may be considering a bitcoin move.GameStop and AMC are known for volatile movements associated with meme stocks. But are meme stocks a buy now?How To Read Stock ChartsInvestor's Business Daily's ratings on IBD Stock Checkup and chart analysis tools hold some vital clues while earnings and growth data on IBD MarketSurge shows a company's quarterly performance.GameStop undercut its 50-day moving average on Jan. 14 as shares plunged 10%. Shares also fell below their 21-day exponential moving average for the first time since third-quarter results were announced on Dec. 10.Meanwhile, shares of AMC have also undercut both moving averages and remain in a downtrend.AMC fell on Jan. 21 after the company disclosed that it had made an at-the-market offering to sell $183.8 million of stock, before commissions and fees, at a price of $3.68 per share. Chief Executive Adam Aron tweeted that it was to raise cash reserves. Shares fell further this week.Short interest is running on the high side for AMC. Based on a simple calculation using IBD MarketSurge data, short interest for AMC is 12.3%.A higher short interest can result in a spike in the stock price, should sellers try to exit their short positions by buying the stock.Third-quarter results announced Nov. 6 lifted shares but the stock quickly gave back the gains. That showed that buying stocks just because they are rallying is a poor strategy. It is better to bring a time-tested method for stock picking and search for buy points in proper bases.Spot Bases And Buy Points With Pattern RecognitionSales of $1.3 billion declined from $1.4 billion in the year-ago period, while a loss of 4 cents per share showed an improvement from a loss of 9 cents a share a year ago.AMC's fourth quarter results are due on Feb. 25.The meme stock has IBD Ratings that are well below ideal levels. The Composite Rating is just 14.Panning out for a longer view, IBD MarketSurge's monthly chart highlights the wild swings that are typical of meme stocks. From a split-adjusted closing price of 11.49 on Dec. 31, 2020, AMC shares hit an all-time high 393.65 on June 2, 2021. That's a gain of 3,326%. But the stock has crashed since then.GameStop jumped after meme investor Keith Gill, also known as \"Roaring Kitty,\" posted the image of a gift on Twitter/X on Dec. 25. Many investors took Gill's post as a cue to look at GameStop stock again. GameStop has a short interest of 8.2%.Earlier, on Dec. 5, the meme investor posted on Twitter/X an image of a mocked-up Time Magazine cover with a blank computer screen and keyboard.AMC jumped nearly 6% after the post, but fell 9% the next day, after the movie theater company announced an agreement to sell 50 million shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.GameStop reported its third quarter results on Dec. 10, a key event for meme traders. Sales of $860 million on a loss of 6 cents per share missed analysts' estimates of $887.7 million in revenue and a loss of 3 cents per share. Still, shares jumped more than 7% the next day.The company also stated that it plans a \"comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance.\" The review may result in more store closures than in the past few years as GameStop seeks to attain what it calls \"sustainable profitability.\"During the quarter, the company also entered a new business and started providing autograph authentication for trading cards at some of its stores.GameStop's volatility is cause for caution. For one thing, volatile movement provides little opportunity for well-formed bases.Streamline Your Hunt For The Best StocksFurther, the stock is down over 70% from its all-time high of 120.75, reached in January 2021.Going back further, the video game retailer grew an investor fan base in late 2020 at the height of the meme-stock frenzy. By January 2021, the meme stock shot up 1,625% to 81.25, then crashed to 9.63 the very next month.Investor's Business Daily recommends stock picks based on strong fundamental performance and chart action while also paying attention to the market and managing risk.GameStop has an IBD Composite Rating of 59, reflecting weak chart action and fundamentals.Meme stocks rallied in May after Gill posted on X for the first time since the pandemic. AMC soared as much as 308% May 13-14 and GameStop gained 271% to the peak of the same two-day period. But today those gains have vanished almost entirely.AMC quickly gave up its gains after the movie theater company on May 15 announced an equity swap to exchange 23.3 million newly issued shares for bonds worth $163.9 million maturing in 2026.These Are The Five Best Stocks To Buy Or Add To A Watchlist NowTop Financial (TOP) was a perfect example of meme stock volatility. The stock skyrocketed in one day from 48.60 to 256.44 on April 28, 2023  a 428% gain. It quickly crashed and traded for under 10 by May 2023.Top stock came public on the Nasdaq in June 2022. The initial offering priced at $5 per share for 5 million shares. Shares popped on the first day of trading, reaching a high of 27.50.The stock rallied more than 50% in early May last year in meme-like action, then reversed gears and fell more than 70% in a single day. Shares have trended even lower since.The stock is trading around 1.60 a share now. It surged 65% on Feb. 9 and was back to its usual trading range the next day. There was no news on the company.The Hong Kong-based fintech generates revenue through commissions on trades of equities, futures and options. Its Composite Rating stands at 14.A meme stock is a speculative play, known for high levels of unpredictability because it can rally or crash in any market, and at any time. Its meteoric rises and heart-stopping crashes typically depend on social media hype and online interest. But short interest can also lead to erratic spikes that have no underlying cause.Hyper stock valuations for these companies depend, for the most part, on young fans and an anonymous following that can appear or disappear overnight. Retail investors dominate the interest in these stocks.These stocks do not follow traditional investment wisdom, which says you should buy stocks based on earnings growth and performance. As such, they are extremely speculative.Please follow VRamakrishnan on Twitter for more stock news and analysis."

        "content": "Bank of America warns of a bubble in US growth stocks echoing the \"Nifty Fifty\" and \"dot-com\" eras.Concentration in US stocks is significantly above historical norms, BofA said.Investors should consider diversifying and focusing on quality stocks to mitigate risks, BofA said.If you listen closely enough, amid all the investors cheering on AI, echoes of some of the great bubbles in history are starting to reverberate through the narrow canyon of skyscrapers on Wall Street.That's the warning Bank of America strategists issued to clients in a note earlier this week.As investors continue to pile into growth stocks, sometimes passively, the market has started to resemble the so-called \"Nifty Fifty\" and \"dot-com\" bubbles in the 1960s and late 1990s, respectively, the bank said. And while stocks could still rise in the near-term, outcomes after those famous bubble periods suggest trouble could be coming.The argument was based on concentration levels in the market. The market cap of US stocks compared to the rest of the world is 3.3 standard deviations away from the historical norm.Within the US, the S&P 500's largest five stocks are now 26.4% of the index.And the market cap of \"new economy\" stocks in the S&P 500 also make up more than half of the index's total value, a record high.Part of the reason the market has gotten so concentrated is because of passive investing, where investors shovel money into indexes indiscriminately, Woodard said.\"Passive funds dominate with 54% market share,\" he wrote.\"Passive disregard for valuations & fundamentals means big upside from innovations,\" Woodard continued, \"but big risk in a bust cycle.\"These concentration levels could mean a long period of pain ahead for investors  like it did after the \"Nifty Fifty\" and \"dot-com\" bubbles.\"Momentum reversals are becoming unusually sharp. A 50%+ 'new economy' drawdown (smaller than dot com) could drag the entire index down 40%,\" wrote Jared Woodard, and investment & ETF strategist at Bank of America, in the February 11 note.\"If the eight sectors outside 'new economy' darlings were to rally 10% and the handful of mega cap tech stocks fell 10%, the index overall would still just be flat,\" he continued. \"Not very healthy or diversified.\"Woodard's warning of a difficult decade ahead for investors aligns with views of strategists at other major Wall Street banks in recent months. Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson said in December that the S&P 500 would see a decade of \"flat-ish\" returns ahead, and Goldman Sachs' David Kostin said the index would return 3% annually, on average, over the next 10 years.The bank did lay out a playbook for how to avoid a potential bear market and \"lost decade\" ahead.First, Woodard said to watch when the S&P 500 equal-weight index starts to beat the cap-weighted index.\"The equally weighted S&P 500 index has outperformed the market cap-weighted index by 1ppt/year since 1958. There have been five periods when the cap-weighted index outperformed; those typically lasted 16 quarters,\" Woodard wrote. \"Today, the cap-weighted index is 2.5 standard deviations overbought relative to the long-term trend.\"Second, consider investing in baskets of quality stocks with lower exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks, Woodard said. Some examples of funds that offer exposure to quality stocks, the bank said, include: the Pacer US Large Cap Cash Cows Growth Leaders ETF (COWG); the iShares MSCI USA Quality GARP ETF (GARP); and the WisdomTree US Quality Growth Fund (QGRW).And third, diversify. Woodard said Derek Harris, Bank of America's head of global wealth and investment management portfolio strategy, recommends keeping each holding in a portfolio under a 15% weighting.Read the original article on Business Insider"

Westpac Banking Corp. is leaning toward further gains in the Aussie in the near-term.AUD/USD has been unexpectedly resilient in the face of repeated tariff shocks, a big change from the fourth quarter, said Richard Franulovich, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney.The Australian dollar has strengthened 2.7% against the greenback this year, the third-best performing Group-of-10 currency, as easing fears over a global trade war have boosted risk assets. The Aussie climbed to the highest since December on Friday, before ending last week at 63.52 US cents.The currencys rebound is bad news for most hedge funds, which held a combined net short position of 44,643 contracts on the AUD/USD pair as of last Tuesday, based on data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.While the Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to lower its benchmark rate for the first time since November 2020 on Tuesday, theres no guarantee that would spur any further Aussie weakness.Swap markets are already pricing in more than three 25-basis-point cuts this year, with a 87% probability of one this week. The near-term risk for hedge funds is that the RBA pushes back against these dovish expectations at the gathering, citing a robust labor market or the potential for higher US tariffs to add to inflation.Topside RisksSince a 25-basis-point cut is almost fully priced in, risks are to the topside in the AUD/USD in case of any disappointment, said Mayank Navalakha, head of foreign-exchange options trading at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore.If the RBA errs on the hawkish side and delays a rate cut, the Aussie may power ahead to as high as 64.50 cents, according to RBC.The worst-case fears of US tariffs appear to be receding  US economic surprises appear to have peaked in November/December, and US interest rates have retreated significantly in the past month, undercutting fundamental support for the US dollar, said Alvin Tan, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at RBC in Singapore.AUD/USD will likely break lower only if USD/CNY breaks through 7.35, and/or EUR/USD falls to parity and below, he said.This weeks main economic events:Monday, Feb. 17: Japan 4Q GDP and industrial production, Indonesia trade balance, Philippines overseas cash remittances, Singapore non-oil domestic exports, Thailand 4Q GDPTuesday, Feb. 18: RBA rate decision and statement on monetary policyWednesday, Feb. 19: RBNZ rate decision, Bank Indonesia rate decision, Australia 4Q wage price index, BOJs Takata speaks and Japan trade balanceThursday, Feb. 20: Australia employment, China 1- and 5-year loan prime rates, South Korea consumer confidence, Taiwan exports orders and 4Q BoP current account balance, Indonesia 4Q BoP current account balance, Malaysia trade balanceFriday, Feb. 21: Japan CPI and PMIs, RBA parliamentary testimony, South Korea 20-day exports/imports, New Zealand trade balance, Malaysia CPIMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

Chinese companies provided only 17% of testing tools and 10% of assembly equipment used in the country in 2023, Metodiev added.(Reporting by Che Pan and Brenda Goh; Editing by Jamie Freed)"

Limited flexibility to adjust premiums also makes California a less attractive market for insurers.As of September 2024, there were 451,799 FAIR Plan policies in force, up 41% from 2023.\"California remains one of the most resilient and forward-thinking insurance markets in the world,\" a spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance said.\"Insurance companies recognize the strength of Californias economy and its leadership in climate resilience and risk reduction.\"RISING COSTS, SHRINKING COVERAGEAn insurer exodus could limit options for the 39 million residents in the state and put a further strain on their finances.\"Tales of California residents finding it ever more expensive to get insurance are legion, assuming they can get it at all,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told Reuters.Insurers will be permitted to charge a temporary fee to customers to pass on half the costs related to their FAIR bill.\"California property owners will ultimately be billed through their insurers to fund the FAIR Plan's assessment,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.\"This is a significant event for California insurers but also a bit of a relief because it seems to put a cap on what the state will ask from insurance companies, and they can now adjust their premium charges to account for this extra expense.\"Industry bellwether Travelers and Zurich-based Chubb have estimated losses of roughly $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, from the wildfires.\"It is going to be a big event for the industry,\" Travelers CEO Alan Schnitzer said in an earnings call last month, referring to the impact the wildfires will have on company balance sheets.LA-based Mercury General currently expects catastrophe losses in the range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion while Allstate has forecast about $1.1 billion of losses, pre-tax, net of reinsurance.Meanwhile, AIG - one of the world's largest commercial insurers - said it expects net losses to be roughly $500 million, before reinstatement premiums.AIG CEO Peter Zaffino in a post-earnings call said the company had reduced its overall California exposure beginning in 2022. The retreat coupled with reinsurance has kept losses tied to the wildfires under check.\"I think that in California we just saw that, the modeling is flawed... some of these states set up vehicles that become a market of last resort, which sometimes become the market of only resort and then they end up taking on a lot of aggregate,\" Zaffino added.Concerns over rising catastrophe losses have also weighed on investors, with the S&P 500 property and insurance index edging up just 0.2% this year, lagging the broader financial industry's 6.2% gain.(Reporting by Manya Saini and Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri and Mohammed Safi Shamsi)"

        "content": "Theres a good chance that Berkshire Hathaways stock will lag the S&P 500 in the coming years.This is a matter of simple probabilities, and not a criticism of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B BRK.A Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett or his designated successors. Given the huge amount of statistical noise in the market, luck plays a considerable role in performance, not only over the short term but in the intermediate term as well. And since bad luck can happen just as readily as good luck, lagging the market cant be ruled out  even for someone with as phenomenal a track record as Buffett.I want to enjoy the time we have left: Im 68 and plan to work past retirement age. Should I empty my $700K 401(k)?He was very paranoid of banks: My mother found $35,000 in cash after my father died. What should she do with it? My date was so awful that, before we parted ways, I asked her to repay me for 50% of the taxi fare. Was I being cheap?We have no prenuptial agreement: Will my wife be able to take my money if I transfer it to my retirement account?Im a wife and mother. Can I secretly change my will and leave everything to my daughter instead of my husband?Reviewing Buffetts track record in light of these probabilities is a helpful prelude to the anticipated release of Berkshire Hathaways annual report, which is expected later this month. Berkshire Hathaway hasnt indicated the exact day on which it will be released, and a phone message left with the companys media-affairs office seeking clarity was not immediately answered.For 2024, Berkshire Hathaways stock beat the market, though barely: Its total return was 25.5% for the calendar year, versus 25.0% for the S&P 500 SPX. As you can see from the accompanying chart, the stock is slightly behind the S&P 500 for trailing 10- and 15-year performance, but slightly ahead over the trailing 20 and 30 years. Over each of these periods, the difference between the companys performance and the stock market is small.To understand why the probabilities dont give much confidence in Berkshire Hathaways future market-beating abilities, consider how many years it would take to convince a rigorous statistician that the companys past performance was due to genuine ability rather than luck. For illustration purposes, Ill extrapolate into the future the companys performance over the past 30 years  the second half of its 60-year period of being managed by Buffett.In the first three decades of Buffetts management, the company was much smaller and able to invest in undervalued small-cap companies. Today, Berkshire Hathaway is so huge that, as Buffett has said in past annual meetings, it is only interested in investing in large companies, since only large firms can make a meaningful impact on Berkshire Hathaways bottom line.Given the companys annualized margin ahead of the market (alpha) over the past 30 years (1.5%) and the standard deviation of the companys annual returns over this period (39.2%), it would take more than 100 years of such performance to conclude at the 95% confidence level that the companys alpha wasnt attributable to sheer luck.In other words, there is no practical way for any of us to have statistical confidence that Berkshire Hathaways market-beating performance over the last 30 years was due to more than luck. Thats another way of saying that the best guess is that the companys future performance will closely match that of the overall market.(Note that a statistician would have reached the opposite conclusion after the first 30 years of Buffetts management of Berkshire Hathaway. Its alpha then was far larger, and as a result those years were more than enough to conclude at the 95% confidence level that the companys performance was due to more than luck. But, as mentioned above, those early years are of limited relevance to forecasting Berkshire Hathaways future performance.)This statistical review of Berkshire Hathaways performance provides the necessary context to consider any of the topics that Buffett may discuss in the upcoming annual report. We may want to put his opinions in a different light if our best guess is that the companys future performance will closely match that of the market.This is particularly the case for what will no doubt be one of the most closely watched data points in the annual report: the size of Berkshire Hathaways cash position, which at the end of 2024s third quarter already stood at a huge $325 billion. Will the companys cash position be even greater at the end of the year, and does that mean Buffett is bearish on the stock market  and how much should we care in any case?Let me repeat that this analysis is not intended as a criticism of Buffetts phenomenal track record. For virtually every other manager, a statisticians conclusion would be even more sobering. Buffett has defied the law of gravity far longer than virtually any of them. But beating the market becomes harder and harder as Berkshire Hathaway grows larger and larger, and eventually even it succumbs to that law.Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch. His Hulbert Ratings tracks investment newsletters that pay a flat fee to be audited. He can be reached at .More: Berkshire buys more Occidental stock.

        "content": "The impact that tariffs and trade wars may have on the economy looks to be weighing on the markets of late. In the past three months, since the presidential election, there has been a lot of turbulence in the market with the S&P 500's gains over that stretch up around just 1%. President Trump has threatened multiple countries with tariffs, but there's still a lot of uncertainty as to how all that will play out.However, investors don't need to get out of the market due to that uncertainty. It can be nerve-racking, and some stocks have been falling due to the potential havoc that tariffs could impose on their businesses. But selling your holdings and possibly getting out of the market because of this can prove to be a costly mistake, and here's why.When you're investing for the long haul, focusing on the bigger picture is of far greater importance while ignoring short-term disruptions like tariffs and policy changes.Furthermore, predicting what the government may or may not do is difficult, if not impossible. After all, legislation can take time, and it can change from one administration to the next. If you're investing in a business that may be so vulnerable to tariffs that they may cripple its ability to compete in the long run, endangering its long-term survival, that may be an important sign that perhaps that business isn't a good choice.Billionaire investor Warren Buffett doesn't worry about economic trends and forecasts. He remains invested and has faith in the long-term growth of the economy. In one of his annual letters, he wrote that \"despite some severe interruptions, our country's economic progress has been breathtaking.\" Betting on America and its long-term growth is something Buffett firmly believes in, and long-term investors would also be wise to focus on the bigger picture and not worry about what might happen with the economy in the next year or two.You might still be apprehensive about holding stocks you're not sure about. If so, there's an easy way to remain invested in the market without having to worry about picking individual stocks: hold an exchange-traded fund (ETF).ETFs can drastically simplify investing for you and give you exposure to many stocks -- sometimes hundreds or even thousands -- through a single investment. That way, you won't depend on just one stock's performance, and you can still stand to benefit from the market's overall performance.A good option for long-term investors is the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG). The fund has a low expense ratio of 0.04% which means that fees won't have a big effect on your overall returns.And the ETF will give you exposure to the top growth stocks in the country, including Tesla, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and many others. There are around 180 stocks in the fund, with tech stocks accounting for 59% of all holdings.There can be some risk with the ETF from one year to the next, especially given how volatile tech stocks can be sometimes. But over the long haul, this fund has trounced the S&P 500, achieving returns nearly 300% over the past five years, while the broader index's gains are around 190%.It can be worrisome to invest when there is economic or political uncertainty. But trying to time the market and pick the optimal moment to invest can be a costly strategy that doesn't pay off. Instead, if you're not sure what to invest in, putting your money into an ETF like the Vanguard Growth Index can be a much safer option to consider. It may go down in the short term, but you can be fairly confident that in the long run, it'll rise in value.Before you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF wasnt one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, youd have $850,946!*Now, its worth noting Stock Advisors total average return is 959%  a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

        "content": "Via Metal MinerThe Copper Monthly Metals Index (MMI) held sideways, although the upside bias appeared to accelerate. In total, the index rose 1.64% from January to February, supported by rising U.S. copper prices. Keep up with the latest tariff news impacting copper prices. Subscribe to MetalMiners free weekly newsletter.Traders continue to price the expectation of tariffs in the United States. Meanwhile, Comex copper prices closed February 10 at their highest level since October, reaching $10,163/mt. While LME copper prices are also up since the start of the year, those gains have failed to keep up with their Comex counterparts. With LME prices standing at $9,410/mt, the delta between the two exchanges now sits at a record high of $753/mt.Source: MetalMiner Insights, Chart & Correlation Analysis ToolThe Comex premium appears to be almost entirely the result of market concerns, as copper imports have not yet been the subject of duties. Currently, the 25% blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico remain on pause, and the most recent 25% tariffs only apply to steel and aluminum imports. However, traders have taken Trumps threats of more comprehensive import duties seriously.Unlike the aluminum market, which sees most trade concerns expressed in the Midwest Premium futures contract, the copper market has no comparable mechanism.The fact that demand appears strong continues to aid bullish expectations. Meanwhile, the rapid development of data centers has started to impact copper product markets. According to reports from one distributor, copper busbars, which distribute electrical power throughout those facilities, are currently under allocation.The rapid growth of AI and the electricity needed to power it has added a significant demand driver for the coming years, even as countries increasingly scale back climate and renewable ambitions.Current demand conditions aside, the raw material market offers little comfort. Treatment and refining charges (TCs/RCs), which miners pay to smelters, remain in search of a new bottom.In trading circles, low TCs/RCs indicate tightness in the raw material supply. While this is partially the result of rising smelting capacity in China, that fact will do little to assuage markets concerned about deep supply deficit projections in the years ahead.While copper prices may very well continue to trend up in the short term, the market signals are far from exclusively bullish. Historically, tariffs tend to have a short-lived impact on exchange pricing, a fact confirmed by both the U.S. steel and aluminum markets.Trumps original Section 232 tariffs, which applied respective 25% and 10% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, were insufficient to carry the market indefinitely. Applied in March of 2018, the HRC price uptrend found a peak by the start of May before trending lower over the next two years. Meanwhile, aluminum prices continued to rise before their reversal at the close of July 2018.As copper prices spiked, China seemingly started to pull away from the market. The Yangshan copper premium, a proxy for Chinese copper demand, has fallen over 14% since its peak in mid-January. While copper demand from Chinas EV and solar sectors remains steady, the lack of demand from its moribund property sector offers a meaningful counterweight.Additionally, the considerably lower energy requirements of Chinas Deepseek AI relative to others has significantly disrupted the industry. This may once again force markets to reimagine copper demand forecasts as AI developers look to rival Deepseeks efficiency.Stop scrambling to react to rapid copper price fluctuations. MetalMiner Insights gives you the foresight to proactively plan your metal spend.Aside from certain product allocation and tightness within the raw material market, there is little evidence to suggest that the refined copper market has meaningfully tightened, at least enough to justify indefinitely higher prices. Although LME inventories have mostly trended lower since August, they remain considerably higher than in recent years and now sit near where they peaked in 2021.Meanwhile, SHFE stocks are in the middle of a rebuild. The last rebuild during 2024 saw stocks jump to their highest level since 2020. Although it was not enough to prevent the copper price uptrend throughout Q2 2024, it was among several market conditions that served to tame bullish expectations and helped prices reverse after their late May peak.As with the SHFE, Comex stocks are also on the rise. Likely aided by the widening premium over LME, copper continues to pour into the U.S. market. As of February 10, stocks stood at their highest level since January 2019, hardly a warning of an impending supply crunch.It remains worth noting that inventory levels do not meaningfully correlate to prices. While they help add to the tapestry of signals that impact market sentiment, they alone do not determine price direction. They are also not the only indicator suggesting a still well-supplied market. Both the LME and Comex copper contracts remain in contango, which may warrant caution among copper bulls.Source: MetalMiner Insights, Chart & Correlation Analysis ToolContango, where a commoditys future price holds a premium over its spot price, is not abnormal in markets. The cost-of-carry model suggests that futures prices should trend higher than spot due to storage, financing and opportunity costs. However, that premium can indicate that spot demand is not meeting future expectations, especially if it proves atypically wide.Unlike the last copper price uptrend, which saw the Comex contract flip to backwardation, the current market shows contango. Futures regained their premium over spot prices in July and have managed to hold onto it ever since. While the spread does not appear historically high or show evidence of widening, it indicates relatively normal market conditions.Meanwhile, the LME copper contract also stands in contango. But unlike Comex, futures remain at an atypically wide premium over their spot counterparts. Since 2012, futures have averaged a $26/mt markup over primary cash prices. Currently, that premium stands at $123/mt, enough to show an unmistakable gap between the two prices on a long-term chart.Source: MetalMiner Insights, Chart & Correlation Analysis ToolIn the short term, tariff concerns and the threat of their possible application remain an upside risk to copper prices. However, conditions do not yet appear to suggest the copper market fundamentals are enough to maintain a strong uptrend after investor reactions to those trade barriers begin to wear off.By Nichole BastinMore Top Reads From Oilprice.comRussia Claims to Be Fully Compliant with OPEC+ Output QuotaOil Prices Drop as Hamas Recommits to the Ceasefire DealEuropean Leaders Demand Involvement in Ukraine Peace TalksRead this article on OilPrice.com"

The move confirmed an earlier report by Bloomberg News that Carrefour was working with advisers on a take-private of the unit.Atacadao closed 10% higher at 7.10 reais on Tuesday, valuing the company at almost 15 billion reais ($2.6 billion). Carrefour was little changed early Wednesday in Paris.From the parent and French standpoint, it is a transaction that makes sense, said Joseph Giordano, an analyst at JP Morgan. Brazil is an interesting market from a top down perspective and Carrefour is the number one player while Brazil is a substantial earnings before interest contributor to the group.Giordano said the deal also implies a huge belief on the Brazilian recovery longer term. He added that financing the transaction will likely come at the expense of capital returns, such as buybacks, which could be the main investor pushback on the proposal.Peninsula, the family office of the Diniz clan and Atacadaos second-largest shareholder, intends to participate in the transaction. The proposal allows it to transform its shares in the Brazilian company into Carrefour stock, according to a separate statement. Peninsula owns about 7% of Atacadao, which went public in 2017, and holds about 8.8% of Carrefour.Bloomberg News reported in November that Carrefour was in the early stages of studying ways to boost its valuation, more than three years after Canadas Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. abandoned talks to merge with the company.At that time, Carrefour and Couche Tard were discussing an offer of 20 ($20.76) a share for the French grocer.

        "content": "By Francesco GuarascioHANOI (Reuters) - Foreign investors accelerated sales of Vietnamese stocks in recent weeks as trade risks grew for the export-reliant country, data shows, despite the prospect of a valuation-boosting market upgrade later this year.The Southeast Asian export hub posted a record trade surplus with the United States last year and also imposes higher duties on imports, exposing it to the risk of U.S. tariffs as the Trump administration moves to reset trade imbalances, analysts have said.Last month, foreign investors reduced their exposure to Vietnamese stocks by 6.4 trillion dong ($251.18 million), according to stock market data. Net selling from the $207-billion market was nearly three times more than in December.The outflow was higher than in the much larger Indonesian market, but lower than in other bigger Asian markets, such as India or South Korea.The trend in Vietnam accelerated in February, when foreigners' net selling amounted to 4.2 trillion dong in the first week of the month alone.This week foreigners' sales have continued, hitting steelmakers after the Trump administration announced 25% duties on steel imports into the U.S. Vietnam is one of the country's main suppliers.The protracted selling has so far not been offset by the prospect of Vietnam being reclassified by index manager FTSE Russell from frontier to emerging market, which officials and analysts consider likely to happen later this year.FTSE added Vietnam in 2018 to its list of markets monitored for an upgrade, and the Communist-run country adopted key reforms in recent months, including in November removing full prefunding requirements on equity transactions for foreign investors, which was a key precondition for the FTSE upgrade.FTSE is expected to issue an interim report in March on monitored markets and decide in September on Vietnam's possible upgrade, multiple officials have said.The World Bank has estimated that an upgrade by FTSE and its bigger rival index manager MSCI would attract $5 billion in additional funding to Vietnam's stock market, noting in a report significant inflows were expected before the upgrade itself, as activist investors would bet on rising valuations.That has so far not happened, as the key prefunding reform coincided with Trump's election win in November and a global outflow of foreign funds from emerging and frontier markets.In November, foreigners' net selling of Vietnamese stocks reached 12 trillion dong, the highest outflow since June.($1 = 25,270.00 dong)(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Kate Mayberry)"

        "content": "By Timothy Aeppel(Reuters) - Austin Ramirez until recently planned to build a new factory in Mexico as part of his Wisconsin-based company's strategy to expand global production and shift away from China.\"Mexico made a ton of sense six months ago,\" said the CEO of Husco, a producer of hydraulic components used in automotive and off-road equipment like bulldozers.Now, not so much.Like many other U.S. manufacturers, Husco faces a growing list of trade policies under the new administration of President Donald Trump that have jumbled investment plans and cast a shadow over an upturn in the domestic manufacturing economy.The threat of tariffs against Mexico, the largest U.S. goods trading partner, jolted many producers like this.Trump made boosting manufacturing a theme on the campaign trail, promising among other things tariffs and fewer regulations. That stance helped win support in faded industrial regions, including swing states like Wisconsin.But now that those policies are taking shape, including moves this week to put additional 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum, the true costs are also coming more into focus. Tariffs on metals, for instance, will help domestic mills that produce them but mean higher prices for the much larger network of companies like Husco that use those raw materials.Meanwhile, the threat of trade wars has created growing uncertainty over how companies should shape their global supply chains.Nick Pinchuk, CEO of Snap-On, a toolmaker based in Kenosha, Wis., told investors last week that getting the election in the \"rearview mirror\" will reduce uncertainty among his customers and help boost business in the year ahead.He noted its hard for these customers, many of them blue-collar mechanics, not to feel lingering \"macro uncertainty\" created by \"ongoing wars, immigration disputes, and lingering inflation.\"Manufacturing, which accounts for 10.3% of the economy, was hit hard by the Federal Reserves aggressive monetary policy tightening between March 2022 and July 2023 to tame inflation. Though the central bank started cutting rates last September, the factory sector has shown few signs of a strong growth upturn.A key survey of U.S. manufacturing activity showed the sector experienced expansion in January for the first time in more than two years, but the threat of tariffs has economists questioning whether the rebound can be sustained.To be sure, some parts of manufacturing are going strong, thanks in many cases to order books that were filled to overflowing during the pandemic boom. Emerson, the St. Louis-based engineering solutions provider, reported first-quarter profits that topped estimates last week, aided by resilient demand in its valves and regulators unit.CEO Lal Karsanbhai told investors in a call that he sees orders ramping up meaningfully in the second half of the year.But even they see tariff turmoil. The company said it was ready to implement price increases and surcharges to protect its profits if new tariffs hit Mexico, for instance.David MacGregor, senior analyst and president of Longbow Research in Cleveland, said that \"until the last couple of weeks\" he thought U.S. factories were setting up for a solid year in 2025.\"Most of these companies have a pretty good order backlog,\" he noted.But MacGregor said he now sees more companies \"tapping on the brakes.\" One telling detail he saw in the latest wave of earnings reports is the weakness in spending by consumers on big discretionary items, like motorcycles.Harley-Davidson, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker, forecast 2025 profits and revenue to be flat to down 5 percent as the company feels the heat from consumers tempering big-ticket purchases. Demand for all types of high-priced toys, a type of spending that boomed during the pandemic days of lockdowns, has fallen off, while sticky inflation and high interest rates have forced more consumers to prioritize spending on necessities.John Healy, a managing director at Northcoast Research in Cleveland, said he and other analysts were expecting consumers to feel more comfortable spending in the months ahead.\"But that hasnt materialized at retail yet,\" he said, noting that while interest rates set by the Fed have declined, consumer borrowing costs have moved down only marginally.At Husco, which is based in Waukesha, Wis., CEO Ramirez said his business remains robust and he still wants to move forward with that expansion once planned for Mexico, but not in the United States.Building in the U.S. isn't an option, he said, because the items to be produced in the new operation have a high labor content. He is considering some other lower-cost country, perhaps India. But recent weeks have shown that tariffs could hit anywhere, Ramirez said.\"Weve seen how things can change,\" he said, \"so its really debilitating to make a decision.\"(Reporting by Timothy Aeppel; editing by Daniel Burns and Claudia Parsons)"

Compounding woes for global luxury goods makers has been a shift among Chinese consumers toward domestic brands.Shares in Chinese beauty brand Mao Geping rose 85% when they debuted on the Hong Kong stock market on December 10, and have climbed further since.In November, Shiseido launched a two-year action plan to restore profitability and focus on its core brands.Shiseido's shares have sunk 42% over the past 12 months, compared with a 5.1% gain in the benchmark Nikkei average during the same period.($1 = 151.8300 yen)(Reporting by Rocky Swift; Editing by Tom Hogue, Jamie Freed and Sherry Jacob-Phillips)"

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock gained around 63% in 2024, virtually all of that in the fourth quarter, especially after President Donald Trump's election win. Now, Chief Executive Elon Musk appears to be signaling 2025 could be a middling year for the EV giant, with only slight vehicle sales growth, even as he continues to sound bullish on the possibility for incredible things to come in 2026, 2027 and 2028.TSLA edged down 0.6% during premarket action on Tuesday after hitting a fresh two-month low of 350.51 early Monday before ending the day down 3% to 350.73. The stock sold off last week, threatening to break decisively below a recent consolidation. Tesla initially rallied after reporting fourth-quarter earnings late on Jan. 29 but has reversed lower since then. Musk told analysts on the Q4 earnings call that in 2025 Tesla will continue to lay the \"groundwork\" for an \"epic\" 2026 and a \"ridiculously good\" 2027 and 2028. That's based on artificial intelligence, fully autonomous vehicles and the Optimus humanoid robot product, according to Musk.Arguably the biggest announcement the earnings call was that unsupervised full self-driving, or FSD, will come as a paid service to Austin, Texas, in June. Musk added there will be robotaxi tests in many U.S. cities by year end. The Tesla head was also bullish on Optimus, projecting the company could be selling units sometime in the first half of 2026.\"Long term, Optimus will be overwhelmingly the value of the company,\" Musk said.Meanwhile, Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's high-profile auto analyst and a TSLA bull, late on Friday removed the firm's \"top pick\" designation for TSLA. Jonas maintained a 430 price target and an overweight rating on the shares.Following Q4 earnings, Jonas wrote the results were \"mostly disappointing,\" but added that the report was not \"particularly narrative changing.\"With President Donald Trump back in the White House and fourth-quarter earnings in the rearview mirror, the top question for investors is: when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock.Tesla announced late on Jan. 29 worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, with Q4 EPS of 73 cents, growing 3% compared to Q4 2023, and revenue increasing 2% to $25.71 billion. After a surprise gain in Q3, Tesla's total gross margins fell 138 basis points to 16.3%. Auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits tumbled to 13.6% vs. 15.7% expected, per FactSet.Musk claims that battery backs are a \"constraint\" this year but that Tesla is working to address that issue.\"I think we will make progress on addressing that constraint and then things are really going to go ballistic next year and then really ballistic in 2027 and 2028,\" Musk said.\"The reality of autonomy is upon us,\" Musk added, again touting the outlook for the value add of FSD.However, Musk has conceded that Tesla EVs with Hardware 3.0 might not be able to achieve true self-driving.Following Q4 earnings, analyst 2025 profit estimates have been coming down. As of Feb. 10, Tesla's 2025 EPS is expected to come in at $2.94, down 11% from the $3.31 expectation prior to Q4 earnings, according to FactSet. Estimates for 2026 have come down significantly as well.Tesla annual earnings are now not forecast to rise above the 2002 peak of $4.07 per share until 2027, according to FactSet.Tesla Rises On Robotaxi Hopes Despite Earnings Miss. Elon Musk Sees 'Epic' 2026.Read more on Tesla's third-quarter results, second-quarter earnings or on the company's first-quarter report.Morgan Stanley's Jonas wrote that the Q4 results were \"mostly disappointing,\" but added that the report was not \"particularly narrative changing.\"\"Tesla's 4Q results are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" Jonas wrote. \"While the journey may be volatile and nonlinear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage.\"William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer noted that he has \"learned to tack 6 to 12 months on Musk's full self-driving (FSD) optimism\" but that the June 2025 rollout for unsupervised FSD is \"well ahead of our 2026 timeline estimate.\"Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla uber-bull, wrote that the \"surprising news\" out of the conference call was the June 2025 target and that this could mean that Tesla's unsupervised FSD\" is in the final stages of being ready for the public and the biggest headwinds remain on the regulatory side, not due to technological capabilities.\"\"With unsupervised FSD expected to be available throughout the U.S. by the end of 2025 and the rest of the world by the end of 2026 this will be a focus of the bulls,\" Ives wrote.CFRA's Garrett Nelson added that despite the earnings miss, with Musk backing off prior 2025 vehicle sales growth expectations, TSLA is moving higher on the unsupervised FSD launch.Electrek reported on Jan. 30 that around a quarter of Tesla's Q4 earnings were due to a $600 billion gain on Bitcoin, meaning Tesla made more profit last quarter from regulatory credits and Bitcoin than from its business operations.Meanwhile, Delaware Court of Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick recently stuck with her January 2024 decision and once more rejected Musk's $56 billion compensation package from 2018. The pay deal is now worth more than $100 billion.In a statement on X, Tesla said it will appeal the court's decision.In June, some 77% of shareholders voting approved giving Musk his 2018 $56 billion pay package, or 72% excluding Musk and his brother, Kimbal Musk. Tesla shareholders also voted this year in favor of reincorporating the company in Texas, moving it from Delaware.Best IBD 50 Stocks To WatchBefore the June 2024 shareholder vote, Musk suggested he might shift Tesla resources to his privately held xAI if he didn't get the pay deal, as well as further power giving him a 25% voting stake.Musk currently has a nearly 13% stake in Tesla. Prior to selling TSLA shares to purchase Twitter, now X, for $44 billion in late 2022, Musk owned around 22% of Tesla.Judge Kathaleen McCormick wrote in in the opinion that, \"Even if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here.\"Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksTSLA shares about 5.8% on Nov. 14 amid reports the president-elect's transition team plans to discontinue the Inflation Reduction Act, IRA, $7,500 EV consumer tax credit. The move was not a surprise to analysts and Musk has appeared to already endorse the idea of cutting the tax credit, echoing the belief that Tesla can thrive without it.However, if the IRA tax credits are stripped away, it could hit Tesla's auto business. The EV giant has already slashed prices repeatedly over the past year to drum up consumer interest amid waning demand.Tesla continues to ramp up incentives, especially in the U.S., as the company targets record deliveries in Q4. The EV giant recently announced a year-end discount on local Model Y sales.\"We expect Musk to have a big seat at the table as these EV discussions happen within the Trump transition team,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote at the time. \"We believe any sell-off in Tesla from these reports is the wrong knee-jerk reaction and we would be buyers.\"Meanwhile, the  Tesla Cybertruck is now eligible for the $7,500 IRA tax credit, which should boost demand, at least to start 2025.Analysts generally see the Trump presidency as an overall negative for EVs, but a positive for Tesla. Musk fostered a good relationship with the president-elect after campaigning tirelessly for him throughout the election cycle.Late on Nov. 12, Trump announced in a statement that Musk will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to \"dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies.\"The Department of Government Efficiency is tasked with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government and will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget.\"\"Musk's significant influence in the Trump White House is already having a major influence and ultimately the golden path for Tesla around Cybercabs and autonomous is now within reach with an emboldened Trump/Musk strategic alliance playing out in real time and very in line with our thesis,\" Ives wrote on Nov. 29.The Lithium Price Cycle Has Bottomed. What To Expect Next For These Stocks.However, JPMorgan in early January estimated that, based on Trump's proposals to remove EV tax credits and subsidies, about 40% of Tesla's profits would be in danger after Trump takes office.\"Tesla does not appear to us on track to dominate the global auto industry amidst the electrification transition, which we view as only the starting point for present valuation,\" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote.Musk set sky-high expectations for the \"We Robot\" event. But after showing off a Cybercab and Robovan late on Oct. 10, the market seemed unimpressed with Musk as he once more claimed full autonomous driving will come \"next year\" but did not offer any details or updates of an \"affordable\" EV.The event was high on theatrics with Musk riding the two-seat Cybercab, with butterfly doors and no steering wheel, briefly to the stage to give his remarks. Dancing Optimus robots were paraded out with the Tesla humanoids serving attendees drinks. However, the consensus among analysts was that while the event was high on pomp and circumstance, it underdelivered on details.Musk did say he expects the Cybercab price tag will be below $30,000, with production starting \"before 2027.\" The Tesla chief also showed off the latest Optimus robot. He expects that the cost could be $25,000-$30,000 when produced at scale.\"That's it? Disappointing lack of detail,\" Jonas proclaimed in his investor note following the event. Wells Fargo analysts echoed that sentiment, writing that Tesla's robotaxi event was mostly \"razzle-dazzle\" with \"little substance.\"\"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipated TSLA to be under pressure following the event,\" Jonas added.Tesla Robotaxi Event: Cybercab, Robovan Unveiled; Musk Sees Self-Driving 'Next Year'Tesla stock sold off hard the day following the robotaxi event, sending a sell signal to investors. However, Cathie Wood and her Ark Invest ignored that and purchased nearly $3 million in TSLA shares.Wood, who has long been super-bullish on Tesla's autonomy push and robotaxi aims, attended Tesla's robotaxi event on Thursday. On June 12, Ark Invest updated its  Tesla stock price target to 2,600 by 2029, estimating that around 90% of Tesla's enterprise value and earnings will be attributed to the robotaxi business in 2029.Wood's Ark Invest tends to purchase Tesla stock and other positions amid sell-offs or when they break below key moving averages. Without a robotaxi network and business, Ark Invest says its TSLA price target would be around $350 per share, according to the report.\"We remain confident that the service will launch within the next five years,\" Ark Invest said.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced in January it opened an investigation into Tesla, citing \"Actually Smart Summon sessions resulting in crashes during the session, including where the operator does not have enough time to react due to vehicle proximity or line of sight.\"Federal regulators wrote they have received one complaint alleging that an Actually Smart Summon session resulted in a crash and has reviewed at least three media reports of apparently similar crashes. All four incidents involve Tesla vehicles operating in Actually Smart Summon failing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash, according to NHTSA.Almost single-handedly, Elon Musk has turned the auto industry on its head. He has essentially forced it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train. Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially during its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021.Tesla stock tumbled 10.6% for the week to 361.62. Shares are now nearly 30% below their traditional 488.54 buy point, the record high from Dec. 18, according to MarketSurge charts.Tesla stock has dropped since hitting resistance on Jan. 31 at a downward-sloping trendline. If TSLA stock rebounds from here the pattern would be a double-bottom base with a 439.74 buy point. A rebound above the 50-day line could offer an early entry. However, there's a real danger that Tesla stock breaks considerably lower.How To Buy StocksThe relative strength line for Tesla stock is also at a three-month low. Tesla sales have tumbled in Europe to start 2025, a sign that Musk's increasingly political statements are hurting the brand there as well as in the U.S. Meanwhile, it's possible the recent stock decline reflects an ongoing re-evaluation of Tesla's earnings report and conference call.The stock consolidated in January, pausing after a scorching hot fourth quarter where Tesla stock logged most of its 63% advance for 2024, especially after Trump's election win.Tesla stock ranks third in the 35-stock IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group. The stock has an 82 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Shares also have a 95 Relative Strength Rating and an 83 EPS Rating.TSLA stock is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist. The stock on Dec. 11 cleared the company's longtime all-time high of 414.50, which it hit on Nov. 4, 2021. The stock had previously last touched 400 in January 2022.

As we move forward, the plan is to ramp up production to exceed 3,000 tons of lithium carbonate per month, they said.Reuters reported on Friday that the mine had restarted, citing a report from UBS. CATL did not respond to emailed questions from Reuters.CATL's mine in the southern Chinese province of Jiangxi has been a major contributor to rapidly growing supplies of lithium in China, the world's top processor of the battery material. Reports of its closure in September had caused lithium stocks to rally sharply.Lithium miner shares in Australia tumbled on Tuesday on news the mine had restarted.The most-traded November lithium carbonate futures contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange closed at 77,300 yuan ($10,578) a metric ton on Tuesday, down 1.6% from Monday's close.CATL's share price on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange closed at 251.8 yuan on Tuesday, down 2.6% from Monday.($1 = 7.3073 yuan)(Reporting by Violet Li and Mei Mei Chu; Editing by Hugh Lawson)"

        "content": "US stocks traded mixed on Tuesday as investors assessed more tariff policy shifts from President Donald Trump and looked ahead to upcoming inflation data.Traders also digested the start of Federal Chair Jerome Powell's two-day testimony in Congress. In his opening remarks, Powell told lawmakers the Fed is not in a rush to adjust interest rates and reiterated the central bank's stance of not commenting on trade policy.By mid-afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) flipped into the green, edging around 0.1% higher. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped roughly 0.1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back about 0.4%, after a winning day on Wall Street.The tone is cautious in the wait for Trump to reveal his plan for universal like-for-like tariffs, promised for announcement midweek. The president on Monday imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from March 12, according to executive orders. That puts further pressure on top trading partners Canada and Mexico.Meanwhile, the countdown is on for January's Consumer Price Index reading on Wednesday and its wholesale counterpart on Thursday, as inflation stays persistent.On the earnings front, Coca-Cola (KO) shares rose after it beat estimates for fourth quarter profit and revenue as soda demand stayed robust amid price increases. Shopify's (SHOP) stock bounced back from pre-market losses after the e-commerce company reported a downbeat first quarter profit forecast with better-than-expected holiday sales.Powell reiterated on Tuesday the importance of Fed independence.\"We'll make better policy and keep inflation lower if we just focus on doing our job and stay out of politics, stay out of elections, and don't try to favor or hurt any political party,\" Powell said, emphasizing the need for central bank leaders to just \"focus on the data.\"\"If we start putting up political filters ... we'll be less effective at our already difficult job,\" he said, although he noted that it's still important for the central bank to remain accountable and be transparent in its decisions.Powell said housing prices are likely to remain elevated, even if mortgage rates decline.\"Housing markets around the country are still suffering from the after-effects of the pandemic,\" Powell said on Tuesday. \"Once that's all the way through and short-term rates are down to normal, whatever the new normal level is, I think housing costs are still going to be high.\"Powell added it will likely continue to be expensive to build homes in many parts of the country, noting, \"There's a short-term problem, which will go away in the coming years, but there's a longer-term problem with housing availability.\"\"And that's that's going to be something that is not within our authority or power to affect.\"The central bank leader also said \"it's not clear\" that lower rates would lead to lower housing inflation since an unlocking of low rates would boost demand.Powell said definitively on Tuesday that \"there will be a regulatory framework\" for stablecoins and that the central bank \"supports\" efforts to create one.\"Stablecoins may have a big future with consumers and businesses,\" Powell said. \"We can't know that now. But it is important for the development of stablecoins and a safe and sound manner that protects consumers and savers.\"A stablecoin is defined as any cryptocurrency designed to have a relatively stable price, typically pegged to a particular commodity or currency such as the US dollar.Powell said he \"would stand by\" previous comments that countries that have remained open to trade and did not erect barriers like tariffs have grown faster and had higher incomes.\"I think the standard case for free trade and all that logically still makes sense,\" the Fed chair told lawmakers on Tuesday. \"It didn't work that well when we have one very large country that doesn't really play by the rules.\"\"And in any case, it's not the Fed's job to make or comment on tariff policy,\" he continued. \"That's for elected people. And it's not for us to comment. Ours to try to react to it.\"Powell's remarks come after President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. Earlier 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.The central bank leader later added it ultimately remains to be seen what tariff policies will be implemented and when: \"I just think it would be unwise to speculate when we really don't know. I mean, we see proposals, but it's so hard to say what's going to happen.\"Powell said he couldn't comment on whether the US economy has achieved a \"soft landing,\" telling lawmakers that it was \"not for me to say.\"The soft landing, defined as a scenario where economic growth slows but not to the point of a recession, has been questioned in recent weeks as some economists believe the US could face another inflation resurgence under President Trump.Powell added, though, that the US is not in a \"hard landing,\" where a restrictive monetary environment forces the economy into a recession.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during the start of his two-day testimony on Tuesday that the playbook has been revised \"in a lot of ways\" following the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023.\"The supervisors didn't follow through aggressively enough on things that they'd said,\" Powell said. \"If they'd done that, that could have been enough to stop it. But a lot of it was just not focusing enough directly on what was a very large amount of interest-rate risk, a large portfolio of long-term securities matched up with an unstable funding base.\"On March 9, 2023, depositors scrambled to pull out more than the $40 billion from SVB as panic spread across Twitter, as well as on other social media platforms like Slack and WhatsApp. The rush came after the bank revealed a $1.8 billion loss within its bond portfolio and plans to raise more than $2 billion in new capital.\"Somehow, we don't expect bank runs outside of a crisis in this country,\" Powell said in his testimony. \"And that's what that was. It was a bank run. And bank runs are incredibly damaging. I think everyone learned a lot from that and is determined to do better.\"Fed Chair Jay Powell is set to begin taking questions from lawmakers in minutes, and in prepared remarks released ahead of his testimony, he reiterated his view that the central bank does not need to be in a hurry to cut interest rates.\"With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" Powell said.Referring to inflation, Powell said pricing pressures remain \"somewhat elevated relative to our 2% longer-run [inflation] goal.\"On the broader economy, Powell said it is expanding at a \"solid pace.\"Coca-Cola (KO) posted another strong quarter as the beverage giant's management team discussed the potential impact of Trump's tariff policy and recent pricing pressures.Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the details: \"Commodities will be in the low-singles range overall, [with] some pressures on the agricultural  particularly juice and coffee  that are a big part of our base,\" Coca-Cola CFO John Murphy said on the earnings call. \"We have the usual set of levers that will deploy to cover those.\"CEO James Quincey added that President Trump's latest aluminum tariffs will predominantly impact the US market.\"If one package suffers an increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said.He added that if aluminum gets more expensive, the company will put more emphasis on plastic bottles. He called it a \"manageable problem.\"US stocks opened lower on Tuesday with tariff uncertainty top of mind for investors as traders also looked ahead to testimony from Federal Chair Jerome Powell on deck later this morning.Shortly after the opening bell, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved around 0.3% lower, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also dropped roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back around 0.5% after a winning day on Wall Street.Oil futures rose 1.4% on Tuesday, on track for a third day of gains, as investors assessed signs that US sanctions on Russian crude are putting a dent in the major producer's output.Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark, climbed to just below $77 a barrel after closing 1.6% higher on Monday. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) moved up to $73.35 per barrel.Russia's oil production fell in January to further below its OPEC+ quota, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, its crude supplies are being offered to Chinese buyers at deeper discount as the US sanctions bed in, it said.The signs of faltering Russian supply appeared to eclipse market worries about the impact on the global economy of Trump's tariff overhaul, which promise to crimp demand.President Trump's unexpected policy moves are unsettling expectations at big financial institutions, David Hollerith reports:Dealmaking had its slowest month in January in more than a decade.

In 2023, German rival alfaview filed a similar grievance to the EU watchdog.Teams, which was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free and eventually replaced Skype for Business, became popular during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing.Making Office with Teams more expensive could help rivals offer their products at competitive prices and entice users to switch to them.Microsoft unbundled Teams from Office in 2023, selling Office without Teams for 2 euros less than Office with the video app. It said Teams standalone would be sold for 5 euros a month.The Commission has asked some companies for feedback, giving them until this week to respond, before it decides whether to do a formal market test, said the three people, all with direct knowledge of the matter.They said Microsoft has also offered better interoperability terms to make it easier for rivals to compete.The EU competition enforcer and Microsoft, which racked up 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in EU antitrust fines two decades ago for tying or bundling two or more products together, declined to comment. EU fines can reach 10% of a company's global annual revenue.If the Commission does accept Microsoft's offer without a fine or a finding of wrongdoing, it would free up manpower and resources for its investigations into Apple and Google, one of the sources said.($1 = 0.9695 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Ros Russell)"

In his opening remarks, Powell told lawmakers the Fed is not in a rush to adjust interest rates and reiterated the central bank's stance of not commenting on trade policy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged around 0.3% higher, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed just above the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back about 0.4%.The tone is cautious in the wait for Trump to reveal his plan for universal like-for-like tariffs, promised for announcement midweek. The president on Monday imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from March 12, according to executive orders. That puts further pressure on top trading partners Canada and Mexico.Meanwhile, the countdown is on for January's Consumer Price Index reading on Wednesday and its wholesale counterpart on Thursday, as inflation stays persistent.Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock seesawed Tuesday after market close as the company said it expects to submit delayed filings to the SEC by the Nasdaq's Feb. 25 deadline to avoid delisting.The company said it \"continues to work diligently toward the filing\" of its delayed annual and quarterly reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and \"believes it will make such filings by February 25.\"Super Micro also reported preliminary quarterly earnings after the bell that missed Wall Streets estimates. Super Micro said it expects to record a revenue of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion for the December quarter, below the $5.95 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.The stock sank as much as 19% before reversing direction. Shares were up nearly 3% late Tuesday afternoon.US stocks closed mixed on Tuesday as investors digested the start of Federal Chair Jerome Powell's two-day testimony in Congress and looked ahead to key inflation data, due Wednesday morning.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged around 0.3% higher while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed just above the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back about 0.4%.Intel (INTC) stock jumped 6.5% Tuesday after US Vice President JD Vance said during an address at the AI Summit in Paris that President Trump will \"ensure\" AI is built with domestically produced semiconductors.To safeguard Americas advantage, the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US with American designed and manufactured chips, Vance said.Intel is the only American leading-edge computer chip foundry  which means it manufactures chips for itself and other companies. US tech firms manufacture their most advanced chips with TSMC (TSM). Though Taiwan-based TSMC and Korea's Samsung are expanding their footprint in the US, most of their manufacturing capacity is in their home countries.Intel's foundry strategy was aggressively pursued by CEO Pat Gelsinger as he looked to bring Intel back to the forefront of technological leadership after decades of missteps. But Gelsinger was ousted by Intel's board in December as investors grew impatient with the money-losing approach. The chipmaker is in the process of searching for a new chief executive, and it's unclear whether its next leader will pursue foundry with the same rigor as Gelsinger.Even with Tuesday's gain, Intel shares are down more than 50% from last year.January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) will serve as the latest test of whether inflation pressures eased further to kick off the year as investors debate if and when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2025.The report, set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, is expected to show headline inflation of 2.9%, matching the annual gain seen in December. Consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.3% over the prior month, a slight deceleration from the 0.4% monthly increase seen in December.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January are expected to have climbed 3.1% over last year, the lowest level since April 2021. This would also mark a downtick from the 3.2% seen in December, which was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI saw a deceleration in price growth.Economists expect monthly core price increases to come in at 0.3%, slightly higher than the prior month's reading of 0.2%, according to Bloomberg data.Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock fell around 7% in afternoon trading Tuesday, ending a five-day rally that saw shares gain nearly 60%.Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has the details:Shares of the Super Micro  a rival to Dell (DELL) that makes computer servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips  soared 18% Monday to nearly $43, their highest level since last October.The stock has been on an upswing ahead of its scheduled business update after the bell on Feb. 11, which investors hope will shed light on how the company is working to comply with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting after a turbulent year.Despite the gain, Super Micro Computer shares remain far below their all-time high of roughly $123 last March ahead of the companys milestone addition to the S&P 500. After that peak  which followed the stocks stellar performance in 2022 and 2023  SMCI shares began to waver as the server maker struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations and grappled with the fallout from a scathing report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research.Super Micro reports its fiscal second quarter earnings for the December period after the bell.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lagged the major indexes on Tuesday, dragged down by megacap names like Tesla as AI spending fears continue to weigh on the Magnificent Seven.Tesla (TSLA) fell over 5% after Chinese automaker BYD (1211.HK) inked a deal with DeepSeek, the China-based generative AI company, to co-develop new autonomous technology.The development comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk captured Wall Street's attention after he offered to buy Microsoft's OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman shot down the unsolicited offer of $97.4 billion, a significant undershoot of its valuation.Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch weighed in on the news in a note to clients:While TSLA has shifted focus to being a Physical AI play, we view Elon Musk's bid for Open AI as a distraction from TSLA's challenges. The bid comes at a 38% discount to Open AI's October 2024 capital raise. We don't expect any meaningful discussions to develop. However, we see increasing risks to Wall Street estimates for TSLA as EV and AV competition intensifies. We also believe CEO Musk's political activity has fans in certain circles, but that his public life risks alienating consumers and employees as the Trump administration tests the limits of its power. We highlight negative trends in CA and EU registrations in 2024 continuing in January 2025 while China data suggests a soft start to the year at negative 11.5%. Elsewhere in tech, Meta (META) began to lay off workers as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pledge to cut thousands of jobs in a pivot to finding AI talent.Gold took a breather on Tuesday after a massive 10% run since the start of the year. But Wall Street sees more room to run on the heels of recent tariff announcements.Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre has the details:On Tuesday, gold futures (GC=F) pulled back after jumping to an all-time high past $2,960 over the past 24 hours in reaction to President Donald Trump's tariff plan against steel and aluminum imports.\"We continue to see gold as an effective portfolio hedge and diversifier,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note Tuesday.Marcelli added: \"We recently raised our gold forecast to USD 3,000/oz for 2025 as we believe the metal will continue to be supported amid fragile risk sentiment and strong demand.\"On Monday the president signed an executive order raising duties on steel and aluminum imports to 25% starting on March 12. The European Union has vowed to react with its own countermeasures, fueling concerns of a trade war.Meanwhile, this week, Trump is expected to unveil a retaliatory tariff plan against countries that impose levies on US goods.In addition to tariff uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, further rate reductions from the Federal Reserve later this year should also boost the investment case for gold,\" UBS's Marcelli said.Read more here.Powell reiterated on Tuesday the importance of Fed independence.\"We'll make better policy and keep inflation lower if we just focus on doing our job and stay out of politics, stay out of elections, and don't try to favor or hurt any political party,\" Powell said, emphasizing the need for central bank leaders to just \"focus on the data.\"\"If we start putting up political filters ... we'll be less effective at our already difficult job,\" he said, although he noted that it's still important for the central bank to remain accountable and be transparent in its decisions.Powell said housing prices are likely to remain elevated, even if mortgage rates decline.\"Housing markets around the country are still suffering from the after-effects of the pandemic,\" Powell said on Tuesday. \"Once that's all the way through and short-term rates are down to normal, whatever the new normal level is, I think housing costs are still going to be high.\"Powell added it will likely continue to be expensive to build homes in many parts of the country, noting, \"There's a short-term problem, which will go away in the coming years, but there's a longer-term problem with housing availability.\"\"And that's that's going to be something that is not within our authority or power to affect.\"The central bank leader also said \"it's not clear\" that lower rates would lead to lower housing inflation since an unlocking of low rates would boost demand.Powell said definitively on Tuesday that \"there will be a regulatory framework\" for stablecoins and that the central bank \"supports\" efforts to create one.\"Stablecoins may have a big future with consumers and businesses,\" Powell said. \"We can't know that now. But it is important for the development of stablecoins and a safe and sound manner that protects consumers and savers.\"A stablecoin is defined as any cryptocurrency designed to have a relatively stable price, typically pegged to a particular commodity or currency such as the US dollar.Powell said he \"would stand by\" previous comments that countries that have remained open to trade and did not erect barriers like tariffs have grown faster and had higher incomes.\"I think the standard case for free trade and all that logically still makes sense,\" the Fed chair told lawmakers on Tuesday. \"It didn't work that well when we have one very large country that doesn't really play by the rules.\"\"And in any case, it's not the Fed's job to make or comment on tariff policy,\" he continued. \"That's for elected people. And it's not for us to comment. Ours to try to react to it.\"Powell's remarks come after President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. Earlier 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.The central bank leader later added it ultimately remains to be seen what tariff policies will be implemented and when: \"I just think it would be unwise to speculate when we really don't know. I mean, we see proposals, but it's so hard to say what's going to happen.\"Powell said he couldn't comment on whether the US economy has achieved a \"soft landing,\" telling lawmakers that it was \"not for me to say.\"The soft landing, defined as a scenario where economic growth slows but not to the point of a recession, has been questioned in recent weeks as some economists believe the US could face another inflation resurgence under President Trump.Powell added, though, that the US is not in a \"hard landing,\" where a restrictive monetary environment forces the economy into a recession.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during the start of his two-day testimony on Tuesday that the playbook has been revised \"in a lot of ways\" following the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023.\"The supervisors didn't follow through aggressively enough on things that they'd said,\" Powell said. \"If they'd done that, that could have been enough to stop it. But a lot of it was just not focusing enough directly on what was a very large amount of interest-rate risk, a large portfolio of long-term securities matched up with an unstable funding base.\"On March 9, 2023, depositors scrambled to pull out more than the $40 billion from SVB as panic spread across Twitter, as well as on other social media platforms like Slack and WhatsApp. The rush came after the bank revealed a $1.8 billion loss within its bond portfolio and plans to raise more than $2 billion in new capital.\"Somehow, we don't expect bank runs outside of a crisis in this country,\" Powell said in his testimony. \"And that's what that was. It was a bank run. And bank runs are incredibly damaging. I think everyone learned a lot from that and is determined to do better.\"Fed Chair Jay Powell is set to begin taking questions from lawmakers in minutes, and in prepared remarks released ahead of his testimony, he reiterated his view that the central bank does not need to be in a hurry to cut interest rates.\"With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" Powell said.Referring to inflation, Powell said pricing pressures remain \"somewhat elevated relative to our 2% longer-run [inflation] goal.\"On the broader economy, Powell said it is expanding at a \"solid pace.\"Coca-Cola (KO) posted another strong quarter as the beverage giant's management team discussed the potential impact of Trump's tariff policy and recent pricing pressures.Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the details: \"Commodities will be in the low-singles range overall, [with] some pressures on the agricultural  particularly juice and coffee  that are a big part of our base,\" Coca-Cola CFO John Murphy said on the earnings call. \"We have the usual set of levers that will deploy to cover those.\"CEO James Quincey added that President Trump's latest aluminum tariffs will predominantly impact the US market.\"If one package suffers an increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said.He added that if aluminum gets more expensive, the company will put more emphasis on plastic bottles. He called it a \"manageable problem.\"US stocks opened lower on Tuesday with tariff uncertainty top of mind for investors as traders also looked ahead to testimony from Federal Chair Jerome Powell on deck later this morning.Shortly after the opening bell, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved around 0.3% lower, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) also dropped roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pulled back around 0.5% after a winning day on Wall Street.Oil futures rose 1.4% on Tuesday, on track for a third day of gains, as investors assessed signs that US sanctions on Russian crude are putting a dent in the major producer's output.Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark, climbed to just below $77 a barrel after closing 1.6% higher on Monday. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) moved up to $73.35 per barrel.Russia's oil production fell in January to further below its OPEC+ quota, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, its crude supplies are being offered to Chinese buyers at deeper discount as the US sanctions bed in, it said.The signs of faltering Russian supply appeared to eclipse market worries about the impact on the global economy of Trump's tariff overhaul, which promise to crimp demand.President Trump's unexpected policy moves are unsettling expectations at big financial institutions, David Hollerith reports:Dealmaking had its slowest month in January in more than a decade. A prized tax break for hedge funds and private equity firms came under threat. And big banks got grilled over whether they \"debanked\" certain customers.These complications were not part of the plan when Donald Trump was elected in November, an event that set off a round of optimistic predictions about an M&A boom, looser rules and a more favorable approach to big Wall Street firms in Washington, DC.Instead, bankers ended January with the lowest number of announced M&A deals within the US since that same month in 2014, according to LSEG data.Trumps new antitrust cops also signaled in the administrations second week that they werent going to give a free pass to big mergers by blocking a potential union between Hewlett Packard (HPE) and rival Juniper Networks (JNPR).And new uncertainties surrounding the presidents tariff plans are leaving many businesses unsure about when to make big moves and what direction borrowing costs might take in the weeks and months ahead.Read more here.Economic data: NFIB small business optimism (January)Earnings: BP (BP), Coca-Cola (KO), DoorDash (DASH), Humana (HUM), Lyft (LYFT), Marriott International (MAR), Shopify (SHOP), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Upstart (UPST), Zillow Group (Z)Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:The start of Trump 2.0 is not quite what Wall Street expectedAltman says 'no thank you' to Musk's $97.4 billion bid for OpenAIGold bumps to a record as US tariffs spur haven demandTrump's like-for-like tariffs could hit some US allies hardBYD starts new EV price war with free smart-driving systemThe most important number for the stock market right nowElliott builds over $2.5 billion stake in Phillips 66Stock indexes in Asia fell on Tuesday as investors warily assessed the impact of Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum, while Chinese carmaker shares slid.Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped over 1%, while the CSI 300 (000300.SS) in Shanghai Shenzen fell 0.5%, both gauges reversing course after rising for several sessions.The Sensex (^BSESN) in Bombay tumbled 1.3% amid concerns over the impact of the new 25% tariff on the primary aluminum producer's exports to the US.On the corporate front, shares of Chinese automakers Xpeng (9868.HK, XPEV) and Geely Auto (0175.HK, GELYF, GELYY) tumbled in Hong Kong, down 9% and 10% respectively.The moves came after China's BYD (1211.HK, BYDDY) launched free smart-driving features across most of its lineup, intensifying a regional EV price war and briefly lifting its share price to a record high.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  Struggling fabric and crafts seller Joann plans to close about 500 of its stores across the U.S.  or more than half of its current nationwide footprint.The move, announced Wednesday, arrives amid a tumultuous time for Joann. Last month, the Hudson, Ohio-based retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year, with the company pointing to issues like sluggish consumer demand and inventory shortages.Joann previously sought Chapter 11 in March 2024 and later emerged as a private company. But after operational challenges continued to pile up, Joann filed for bankruptcy again in January. Its now looking to sell the business  and maintained in a filing Wednesday that closing underperforming locations is necessary to complete that process.\"This was a very difficult decision to make, given the major impact we know it will have on our Team Members, our customers and all of the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. (But) right-sizing our store footprint is a critical part of our efforts to ensure the best path forward.Joann currently operates around 800 stores across 49 states. The initial list of the roughly 500 locations it's looking to close can be found on the company's restructuring website  spanning states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and more.When exactly those closures will take place and how many employees will be impacted has yet to be seen. Joann's Wednesday motion seeks court permission to begin the process.Joann's roots date back to 1943, with a single storefront in Cleveland, Ohio. And the retailer later grew into a national chain. Formerly known as Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, the company rebranded itself with the shortened Joann name for its 75th anniversary.Both of Joanns bankruptcy filings seen over the last year arrived amid some slowdowns in discretionary spending  notably with consumers taking a step back from at-home crafts, at least relative to the early COVID-19 pandemic boom. Joann has also faced rising competition in the crafts space from rivals like Hobby Lobby, as well as from larger retailers, like Target, who now offer ample art supplies and kits.And, while Joann turned to implementing a new business plan after emerging from bankruptcy last spring, unanticipated inventory challenges post-emergence, coupled with the prolonged impact of an excessively sluggish retail economy, put (Joann) back into an untenable debt position, interim CEO Michael Prendergast noted in a sworn court declaration filed when Joann initiated its latest Chapter 11 proceedings on Jan. 15.Prendergast explained that inventory shortages had significant ripple effects on Joanns core business, particularly when in-stock levels eventually dropped by upwards of 10%\" and led to a new phase of operational distress.Citing these and other macroeconomic challenges seen in the retail space over recent years, Joann has maintained that a sale of the business is the best path forward. The company says it has a proposed stalking horse bid agreement with Gordon Brothers Retail Partners."

        "content": "By Siyi Liu and Chen AizhuSINGAPORE (Reuters) - The amount of Russian and Iranian oil held on ships has hit multi-month highs as harsher U.S. sanctions reduced the number of buyers, leaving fewer tankers available to deliver cargoes and driving up crude costs, trade sources and analysts said.Washington has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on ships and entities dealing with oil from Iran and Russia since October, disrupting trade with major importers China and India.U.S. President Donald Trump last week restored his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran that includes efforts to drive its oil exports down to zero in order to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.The OPEC producer has struggled to attract new vessels to fill the shipping capacity gap since the sanctions were imposed in the fourth quarter, said Xu Muyu, a senior analyst at data analytics firm Kpler.A ban last month by China's Shandong Port Group on sanctioned tankers from calling at its ports in the eastern province, home to most of the independent refiners that are the main buyers of Russian and Iranian oil, has also made it difficult for such cargoes to discharge.Shipbroker Braemar ACM said 57% of the 126 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) currently involved in Iran's crude trade to China are already subject to U.S. sanctions.As exports have risen and deliveries to China have dropped, the amount of Iranian oil in floating storage has expanded by between 10 million and 20 million barrels so far this year, according to three analysts' estimates.However, calculations of the total volume of Iranian oil in floating storage vary widely as the analysts use different methodologies to track the so-called shadow fleet.Data from Kpler showed Iranian oil floating storage at more than 25 million barrels, the highest in more than a year, with about 80% of the cargoes floating off the waters of Singapore and Malaysia.In contrast, Emma Li, a senior analyst at tanker tracker Vortexa Analytics, estimates the volume of Iranian crude and condensate in floating storage stood at 73.1 million barrels at end-January.Iran's exports rose for a second month to 1.78 million barrels in January after hitting a two-year low of 1.45 million in November, she said.\"Smuggling techniques such as deactivating and spoofing AIS transponders and undertaking ship-to-ship transfers means there may be even more Iranian oil starting to float,\" said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultancy Energy Aspects.With fewer non-sanctioned ships to deliver oil to China, crude prices have climbed.Discounts for flagship Iranian Light crude have narrowed to 50 cents per barrel against ICE Brent, a multi-year peak, versus discounts of $2.50 per barrel about two months ago, on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis to Shandong province for a cargo arriving in March, traders said.RUSSIAFor Russian oil, tougher sanctions imposed a month ago by the outgoing Biden administration have driven up costs for refiners in China and India, with March ESPO Blend crude traded at $2 to $3 above ICE Brent on a DES basis to China, the highest premiums in more than two years, three trade sources said.And transport costs have soared, too, with fewer vessels available. The cost of shipping oil from Russia's Far East to north China last stood at around $4.5 million, roughly triple what it was before the latest U.S. sanctions, though down from as high as $7 million shortly after they were announced.Russian crude-on-water hit a two-month high of 88 million barrels on January 27, 24% higher than on January 10 when the sanctions were announced, Kpler data showed.The volume has declined since late January as Russian crude exports fell, while some cargoes have discharged, Kpler's Xu said.Also, several vessels previously engaged in moving Iranian oil are switching to Russian trade, she added.(Reporting by Siyi Liu and Chen Aizhu in Singapore; Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London; Editing by Florence Tan and Sonali Paul)"

        "content": "Aviva's Indian unit has been ordered to pay nearly $7.5m in back taxes and penalties following an investigation by Indian tax authorities, reported Reuters.This was first reported in August 2024.The probe revealed the creation of fictitious invoices to pay illegal commissions and incorrect tax credit claims.According to the authorities, between 2017 and 2023, Aviva India disbursed around $26m to vendors, allegedly for marketing services.However, these payments were purportedly a facade to provide agents with commissions exceeding regulatory caps.The clandestine operations led to Aviva India incorrectly claiming tax credits and avoiding taxes amounting to $5.2m.After assessing Aviva's defence, Joint Tax Commissioner Aditya Singh Yadav concluded that the company had evaded taxes worth nearly Rs326m.Consequently, Aviva India has been hit with a 100% penalty, bringing the total liability to Rs653m rupees, as per the order.\"The vendors were just puppets playing their role for Aviva to get them undue benefit of bogus\" tax credits, said the order, which has not been made public.\"Vendors were selected as face mask to conceal the game of input tax credit,\" it added.In a statement to Reuters, Aviva India said it \"will contest the latest order through an appeal. The order will have no impact on its operations.\"Aviva denied any misconduct before the tax authority, claiming the allegations as \"incorrect and unsustainable\" and affirming that the vendors had indeed provided legitimate services.However, the investigation notices from the previous year included evidence such as email screenshots and messages that suggested Aviva executives and insurance distributors discussed circumventing compensation limits through fraudulent invoices and improper tax credit claims.Furthermore, Aviva was accused of hiring \"agent mentors\" under the guise of training sales agents, who issued fake invoices to facilitate excess commission payments.This practice, as reported by Reuters in December, was allegedly an internal business model initiated in 2013 and sanctioned by top India executives.The UK-based company increased its stake in the Indian unit to 74% in 2022.

While further details are sparse, the people said President Xi Jinping is expected to attend.The Chinese leader's schedule is closely guarded and often remains unclear until the last minute. But a meeting involving Xi and Ma has the potential to send a powerful signal that China's Communist Party is adopting a more supportive stance toward private-sector companies that fuel most of the countrys economic growth.The outspoken entrepreneur became one of the most high-profile casualties of Xi's crackdown on the private sector in 2020, when authorities shocked the world by scuttling the blockbuster initial public offering of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group Co.Read more here.Economic data: Retail sales (January); Retail sales ex-auto and gas (January); Import and Export prices index (January); Industrial production (January)Earnings: Moderna (MRNA)Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:Dimon wants DC to untangle 'spaghetti' of bank rulesTrump is preparing to change CHIPS Act conditionsGameStop stock pops amid talk it's exploring bitcoin shiftWhy egg-flation could end up being a headache for the FedChina invites Alibaba's Jack Ma, DeepSeek founder to meet top leadersTesla dip buyers face a treacherous path amid bearish signalsCoinbase earnings get boost from the Trump sea changeApple plans to launch AI features in China from May, Bloomberg News reportsAirBnB (ABNB)Shares of Airbnb soared over 14% in extended trading following stronger-than-expected Q4 profit, with revenue rising 12% to $2.5 billion and net income of $461 million.

Sony sold 9.5 million units of the PlayStation 5 in its fiscal third quarter and reported a record number of PlayStation online subscribers for any console generation, now at 129 million.The PS5 has now beefed up its library of games and broadened its user base, Morningstar Research Director Kazunori Ito said. This should guarantee profit generation in the next fiscal year and the year after that.Sonys earnings are also getting a boost from its music segment, with streaming services lifting revenue from both recorded music and music publishing. The companys music operations, which also house smartphone games and anime publishing, were further helped by the continued popularity of such offerings outside Japan.Along with its earnings, the tech conglomerate, whose shares had been flat from the start of the year, announced a facility to buy back as many as 30 million shares, or 0.5% of its outstanding stock, worth as much as 50 billion through May 14."

        "published": "2025-02-14T11:14:19Z",
        "source": "Reuters",
        "content": "By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart's (WMT) quarterly report in the coming week will give investors fresh insight into the health of U.S. consumers, who are facing stronger inflation and uncertainty over whether President Donald Trump's tariffs will push up prices.The benchmark S&P 500 stock index was up about 1% for the week, with stocks showing resilience despite a hot report on consumer prices that led investors to push back expectations of further interest rate cuts this year.Wall Street closely watches trends in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The extent to which inflation is weighing on shopping behavior could become more evident with Thursday's earnings report from retailer Walmart.\"Walmart is sort of a canary in the coal mine as far as consumer spending and consumer health is concerned,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.Walmart's report could show \"how much of higher food prices and higher gasoline or energy prices is digging into the discretionary spending of consumers,\" Pavlik said.The S&P 500 has climbed more than 3% this year, with broad gains among sectors. Investors have digested a flurry of policy announcements from the Trump administration, including on tariffs and federal government cost cuts, and more recently, discouraging data on inflation.Stocks sold off modestly on Wednesday after a report showed consumer prices in January jumped by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years, with Americans facing higher costs for a range of goods and services.The CPI data came on the heels of a survey that revealed U.S. consumer sentiment sank in February to a seven-month low as inflation expectations soared. Households feared it may be too late to avoid the negative effects from Trump's threatened tariffs, according to the survey's director.Company executives are grappling with the potential fallout from tariffs. Since the beginning of the year, nearly 430 companies in the S&P 1500 have either mentioned tariffs or responded to a question about tariffs on earnings calls or at investor events, according to LSEG data.Walmart, as the most important consumer company in the country along with Amazon, will be closely watched for its commentary, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.\"It's not just what their numbers are and their guidance, but what they say about the consumer,\" Maley said.Walmart's comments could help address whether people are \"so worried about tariffs that they're starting to question some of their spending,\" Maley said.A Walmart spokesperson declined to comment, saying the company was in a quiet period ahead of its earnings report.Walmart's report will be followed by results in the next few weeks from a range of consumer companies, including home improvement company Home Depot, off-price retailer TJX Cos and Target, that will also wind down fourth-quarter reporting season for corporate America.With nearly three-fourths of index companies having reported, S&P 500 earnings are on track to have climbed 15.2% from the year-earlier period, its strongest pace in three years, according to LSEG IBES data.Still, expectations for S&P 500 (^GSPC) profits in 2025 have moderated since the start of the year, which some investors said has undercut optimism from the fourth-quarter reports.The potential impact from import tariffs - which are expected to weigh on profits and drive up inflation - is poised to remain prominent on Wall Street's radar in the coming week. Trump has announced a 10% tariff on China and a broad duty on steel and aluminum imports, while delaying tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\"No one's quite sure what's a negotiation and what's the policy,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments. Hedge funds and other large investors, he said, \"don't want to be caught short only to see a reversal in policy that causes the market to come right back.\"(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; additional reporting by David Gaffen; editing by Rod Nickel)"

        "content": "Buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a time-tested strategy is incredibly hard. So what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist? Fiserv (FI), Axon Enterprise (AXON), TJX (TJX), Bank of America (BAC) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) are prime candidates.The market confounded expectations for difficulties and turned in an outstanding performance in 2023 and 2024. Donald Trump's election victory boosted stocks, though traders are now weighing the pros and cons of his plans, such as levying tariffs, as we move deeper into 2025. The Federal Reserve is also seeing fewer interest rate cuts ahead amid ongoing labor market strength.Remember, there are thousands of stocks trading on the NYSE and Nasdaq. But you want to find the very best stocks right now to generate massive gains.The IBD Methodology offers clear guidelines on what you should be looking for. Invest in stocks with recent quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%. Look for companies that have new, game-changing products and services. Also consider not-yet-profitable companies, often recent IPOs, that are generating tremendous revenue growth.Using such an approach can help give you an edge over the benchmark S&P 500. Outdoing this industry benchmark is key to generating exceptional returns over the long term.In addition, keep an eye on supply and demand for the stock itself, focus on leading stocks in top industry groups, and aim for stocks with strong institutional support.Once you have found a stock that fits the criteria, it is then time to turn to stock charts to plot a good entry point. You should wait for a stock to form a base and then buy it once it reaches a buy point, ideally in heavy volume. In many cases, a stock reaches a proper buy point when it breaks above the original high on the left side of the base. More information on what a base is, and how charts can be used to win big on the stock market, can be found here.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The major indexes surged to record highs in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory, though a more cautious outlook from the Fed on interest rates is weighing on stocks.The stock market is off recent highs, but fighting back. The S&P 500 has rallied past its 50-day moving average while the Nasdaq composite has also just moved back above the key benchmark.Investors should be looking to buy high-quality issues with good growth prospects. The selections below are among the best stocks to buy or watch now. The IBD 50 is also a rich hunting ground.Nevertheless, it remains crucial to stay on top of sell signals.

Edison is based in Rosemead, California.Shareholders often sue companies for alleged misleading disclosures or omissions after unexpected events cause stock prices to fall.The several Los Angeles-area wildfires last month may prove the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history.The case is Antillon v Edison International Inc, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-01154.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

        "content": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors are investigating e-commerce giant Amazon and three of its executives over alleged tax evasion worth 1.2 billion euros ($1.26 billion), two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.News of the investigation broke last year, but the details over its extent emerged on Friday, first reported by the Italian daily Corriere della Sera.Amazon said in an emailed statement to Reuters it would not comment on ongoing investigations.\"Amazon is committed to complying with all applicable tax laws\", the company said, stressing it was among Italy's top 50 tax contributors, with its tax bill for the country exceeding $1.4 billion in 2023.Milan prosecutors and tax police placed the three managers and Amazon's Luxembourg-based European unit under investigation for tax fraud in online sales in Italy during 2019-2021, the sources said on Friday.They said the bill for Amazon could rise to 3 billion euros, taking into account penalties and interest.According to the sources, Amazon's algorithm allows it to sell in Italy goods from non-EU sellers, mostly Chinese, without disclosing their identity, helping them avoid paying Italian value-added tax (VAT).Under Italian law, an intermediary offering goods for sale in Italy is co-responsible for the non-payment of VAT by non-EU sellers that use its e-commerce platform.If the allegations stand up in court, they could pose a threat to Amazon's business model across Europe, since VAT is a harmonised European tax, the two sources said.The investigation, which started in 2021, resulted from routine checks carried out by tax police in an area north of Milan, the two sources said. They could not be named because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.In another case, Italian tax police in July 2024 seized approximately 121 million euros from an Italian unit of Amazon as part of an investigation into alleged tax fraud and illegal labour practices that is ongoing.Milan prosecutors accused the logistics unit Amazon Italia Transport of circumventing labour and tax laws, relying on cooperatives or limited liability companies that supplied workers while omitting VAT duties and reducing social security payments.In response Amazon said at the time that it had respected the necessary rules.($1 = 0.9555 euros)(Reporting by Emilio Parodi, editing by Alvise Armellini, Barbara Lewis and Alistair Bell)"

VinFast had initially planned to sell 100,000 cars last year.\"VinFast's 2024 results exceeded expectations, demonstrating resilience in the face of market fluctuations and macroeconomic volatility,\" said VinFast Chairwoman Thuy Le.The startup is pursuing an aggressive but costly expansion strategy in Vietnam, where it can rely on a growing market of nearly 100 million people. In the last quarter, sales were also boosted by the introduction of a much cheaper and smaller model.However, the company lost nearly $2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, latest available data show, after posting $2.4 billion in losses in 2023. That is putting pressure on its parent company, Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup.The carmaker also wants to expand abroad but has so far struggled to attract foreign buyers.In a previous statement in January, VinFast said it had sold more than 87,000 units in Vietnam last year. Barring a revision of its own figures, that would mean only about 10,000 cars were sold abroad, around 10% of total sales.Last year the company postponed plans for a factory in the United States, in what appeared as a shift to Asian markets, and in particular to India and Indonesia, where it plans to establish two assembly factories.VinFast did not provide a breakdown of sales by market.Most of its sales in Vietnam in 2023 were to companies linked to its owner Pham Nhat Vuong, including electric taxi operator Green SM, or GSM, which in the last quarter of 2024 overtook Southeast Asian ride-hailing giant Grab as the top taxi company in Vietnam, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence.A full breakdown of domestic buyers for last year is not available, but in the third quarter about 20% of total deliveries went to VinFast's related parties, according to its quarterly earnings.The company is expected to release full-year results on April 24.(Reporting by Phuong Nguyen; editing by Francesco Guarascio, Martin Petty and Susan Fenton)"

Unblock Tech also did not respond to requests for comment.\"In the field of video content infringement, cross-border infringement is the most difficult to restrain ...

Altman then became CEO of OpenAI and launched a for-profit unit within the startup to secure funding from investors such as Microsoft.Altman is now working on a plan to restructure the core business into a for-profit firm that will no longer be controlled by its non-profit board. The non-profit will, however, continue to exist and own a stake in the for-profit company. Musk has sued to prevent this transition.Several analysts have said regardless of the outcome, the bid could complicate OpenAI's efforts to turn into a for-profit company as it may set a high floor value for the non-profit that controls the startup.Questions have been rising on whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the non-profit arm fairly, since Reuters first reported in September its plans for the change in structure.SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January, meaning the non-profit could own a stake with significant value in the company.(Reporting by Shivani Tanna and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru, Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Devika Syamnath and Rod Nickel)"

        "content": "By Isla BinnieNEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon scorned calls from some employees to soften the bank's five-day return-to-office policy in an animated town hall meeting on Wednesday, according to a recording reviewed by Reuters.Employees at the largest U.S. bank have complained on internal message boards and chats about losing hybrid working arrangements, and one group launched an online petition urging Dimon to reconsider.When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said: \"Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,\" he said, drawing some laughter.JPMorgan declined to comment.Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.The rollback of remote working policies has prompted groans from some workers as COVID lockdowns receded. JPMorgan's call for more workers to come back brought a deluge of complaints, many from back-office workers.Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the U.S. finance sector, CWA campaign lead Nick Wiener said.About 950 people had signed the petition against the five-day policy by Wednesday evening. JPMorgan has more than 317,000 employees worldwide.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity.JPMorgan's profits surged to a record in 2024 and its share price has roughly doubled in the past five years. The strong performance prompted some workers to question why they needed to spend more time in the office.In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said.\"There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,\" he said. \"Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.\"Dimon's view is shared by many Wall Street leaders and President Donald Trump, who demanded the end of remote work arrangements in the federal government.Dimon has asked all of the bank's departments to show 10% gains in efficiency, which would entail 10% cuts in reports, meetings, documents and training sessions.During the town hall, Dimon recounted a story about a wealth management matter that required 14 committee approvals.\"I feel like firing 14 chairmen of committees, I can't stand it anymore,\" he said. \"I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'm the boss.\"He also cited performance reviews for the bank's operating committee that could stretch to six pages.\"Because of legal and risk, they have to look at it, the regulators might say, there could be litigation around it, so you have to be careful,\" Dimon said. \"I get the thing, I throw it in the goddamned garbage can.\"In the wide-ranging conversation, one questioner asked how Dimon felt about Trump's decision to stop work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dimon said some consumer protection rules were good, but that the CFPB had overstepped its authority, echoing mixed feelings across the industry. He used an expletive to describe former director Rohit Chopra.A spokesperson for Chopra declined to comment.Dimon was also asked about hiring.The bank is working to keep headcount flat, and \"we continue to invest in hiring new professionals where appropriate and currently have 14,000 open positions,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.(Reporting by Isla Binnie, additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer and Nupur Anand in New York, editing by Lananh Nguyen, Megan Davies, Gerry Doyle and Chris Reese)"

Apple's measures had created an artificial opacity in its ecosystem that led to less choice, higher costs for apps, and less protection against ad fraud, all while boosting Apple's revenues from services,\" said Thomas Hoppner, partner at law firm Hausfeld, which represents the complainants.\"For the first time it has been clarified that Apple may not rely on pretextual privacy arguments to massively restrict competition in its favor,\" he said.Companies found guilty of breaching Germany's antitrust rules risk fines as much as 10% of their annual turnover.(Reporting by Rachel More in Berlin and Foo Yun Chee in Brussels, editing by Thomas Seythal and Elaine Hardcastle)"

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco International expects a shift towards cheaper cigarette brands in the United States to reach more than 40% of the market by 2027, its finance chief told Reuters.U.S. smokers have been swapping out brands such as Altria's Marlboro and British American Tobacco's (BAT) Newport, which have been raising prices for years, for less expensive brands as high inflation and interest rates stretch their wallets.BAT's U.S. cigarette volumes fell 10.1% last year in part due to this shift, it reported on Thursday, while Altria has also been losing market share.Those companies hope the trend is temporary and will recede as economic pressures ease. But Japan Tobacco International expects pricier brands to continue losing ground even as affordability improves, finance chief Vassilis Vovos told Reuters.\"This is a... hard trend and we see it continuing over time,\" he said, adding steep price increases will continue to push consumers to trade down - a trend visible in many markets where big price gaps emerge.Tobacco giants such as Altria and BAT have relied on increasing prices to support revenue growth in markets like the United States, the world's second largest tobacco market after China, as falling smoking rates have put the industry's volumes into structural decline.JTI, which is part of Japanese conglomerate Japan Tobacco, expects the value and super value segment to account for 42% of the market by 2027, up from around 32% in 2022, Vovos said in an interview the day after the company reported full-year results.JTI completed the acquisition of U.S. tobacco company Vector Group last year, which pushed its share of the super value segment to 40% by the fourth quarter of 2024, its results presentation showed.(This story has been corrected to clarify that the share of the value and super value segment was estimated at around 32% in 2022, not today, in paragraph 7)(Reporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Susan Fenton)"

        "content": "(Reuters) -Spirit Airlines on Tuesday rejected Frontier Group's revised acquisition offer, worth about $2.16 billion, saying the bid from its fellow ultra-low-cost carrier was less beneficial to shareholders than its ongoing reorganization plan.Frontier's fresh offer was a reiteration of its proposal from earlier this month, in which it had proposed that Spirit's shareholders would get $400 million in debt and a 19% stake in Frontier.However, it dropped a requirement that Spirit complete a $350 million equity rights offering and use the proceeds to retire its debtor-in-possession facility. It also requires the bankruptcy court-approved $35 million termination fee be waived.However, Spirit, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year and expects to complete its restructuring in the first quarter, said the revised proposal did not address certain material risks and issues it had previously identified.Instead, the Florida-based airline offered a counterproposal in which Spirit shareholders would get $600 million in debt and $1.185 billion in equity -- which Frontier rejected.\"We remain convinced that the combination of Spirit and Frontier would have created more value than Spirit's standalone plan,\" Frontier said in a statement.The two companies had been in merger talks since at least 2022, even before Spirit filed for bankruptcy due to prolonged periods of financial losses and a substantial debt load.However, JetBlue Airways jumped into the fray and prevailed. But that deal was scrapped after a U.S. judge blocked it on anti-competition concerns.Frontier revived its takeover efforts earlier this year, but Spirit had said the first offer was inferior to the one the two companies had discussed last year and sought an assurance that the deal would close, and that Frontier would not walk away.(Reporting by Harshita Meenaktshi in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Pooja Desai)"

It is not illegal for a company to create a business model based on what it believes to be important ethical and business standards.They added that, By cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success.Target declined to comment.In late January, Target said the changes to its Belonging at the Bullseye strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year.

A gauge of forward earnings that compares companies forecasts with analysts projections is the lowest in a year after plunging to a level last seen in 2016 earlier this month, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.Theres plenty of reasons for doubt. A full-fledged trade war will likely weigh on export demand and overseas profits of multinational firms. At home, inflation remains sticky and the Federal Reserve appears in no rush to cut interest rates.The uncertainty entering this year is as great as it has been in years and executives are trying to navigate through that with more modest guidance, said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated US growth at AllianceBernstein. Fourth-quarter earnings results are strong, but it didnt fully follow through to 2025 guidance.Historically, stocks tend to react more to guidance than actual results, and traders reward companies that delivered better-than-expected forecasts. Companies that guided higher on profit and sales this earnings season have outperformed the S&P 500 Index by 6.7% within a day of reporting results  the second-most since early 2020, BI data show.Of course, C-suite executives may prove to be conservative in their projections in the coming months, setting the stage for a rally since reduced earnings estimates would lower the bar for companies to clear. Meanwhile, analysts have been hesitant to revise their outlooks for this year and beyond until more companies deliver profit guidance. Just 80 companies in the S&P 500 have issued first-quarter outlooks so far.This is the classic dance of Wall Street analysts and company guidance, where very ambitious estimates are put in place from the sell side and companies guide them to beatable numbers, said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Wealth. The big question is when will tariffs have real teeth?Even analysts outlook for all of 2025 for the S&P 500 has steadily fallen since the start of the year. They see S&P 500 companies growing profits by 10% this year, down from nearly 13% in early January, according to data compiled by BI. Though for 2026, forecasts havent budged, with analysts anticipating that profits will still climb by 14% next year.Trump will always create volatility for markets, but if you look at the underlying fundamentals for earnings growth, things are still really strong, said Nancy Tengler, chief executive of Laffer Tengler Investments.The stock market is forward looking so traders are discounting whats going to happen at least six-to-12 months out. As profit margins continue to recover after being squeezed by inflation thats eroded companies ability to pass on costs to consumers by raising prices, investors remain optimistic about earnings growth in 2026.Its an encouraging prospect for a market that is brushing up against record highs even as the Fed signals it intends to keep rates higher for longer.The risk, however, is that inflation will remain stickier than expected, forcing monetary officials to reconsider interest-rate easing. Consumers are already pulling back on spending amid higher prices with retail sales slumping in January by the most in two years.Investors will read the first tea leaves from retailers Thursday, when Walmart Inc. delivers results before the market opens, providing investors with crucial insight into consumer strength, economic growth and corporate profitability.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The regulators \"are conducting comprehensive studies and will unveil proposed measures to improve the existing [fundraising] system within this year,\" he said at a meeting of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Financial Cooperation Committee. \"We hope to further facilitate mainland companies, including firms in Shenzhen, to raise capital.\"The committee, established in June 2024, focuses on the two cities' financial ties and the development of the Greater Bay Area's financial infrastructure.Hui's statement is expected to spark enthusiasm among mainland firms for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong as they pursue fresh capital to power their expansion.The city's IPO market is recovering from a years-long slump as more mainland-listed companies pursue flotations.About 100 companies were in the IPO pipeline, Bonnie Chan Yiting, CEO of HKEX, said last month.A view of Exchange Square in Central, home of Hong Kong's stock exchange operator, on January 9, 2025.

Photo: Jelly Tse>The city's high-quality and international professional-services sector could assist in further liberalisation of the mainland's financial markets, Hui said at the meeting.Over the past two years, regulators from both Hong Kong and the mainland have stressed the importance of closer links between the capital markets to buoy the Chinese economy.They also highlighted Hong Kong's role as a bridge between the mainland and global markets, while promising to create more cross-border schemes to allow greater capital flows.\"Mainland companies, particularly those that are keen on internationalising their businesses, will treat Hong Kong as their top choice when looking to raise funds,\" said Ivan Li, a fund manager at Loyal Wealth Management in Shanghai. \"Most of them are eager to know to what extent the Hong Kong regulators will lower listing requirements and streamline application procedures.\"Carlson Tong Ka-shing, HKEX chairman, said early this month that the exchange received 30 IPO applications in January, including seven so-called A+H applications, referring to companies that already have mainland-listed shares, or A shares, and want to add Hong Kong shares, or H shares. A total of 10 such applications were under processing, he said.On Tuesday, Contemporary Amperex Technology, also known as CATL, submitted its listing application draft with the Hong Kong exchange. The company is expected to raise at least US$5 billion in what could be the city's biggest IPO in more than four years.The world's largest producer of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), based in Ningde, in east China's Fujian province, said proceeds from the proposed IPO would reinforce its global expansion, which would enhance China's dominance in the EV supply chain.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) finished down 8 cents, or 0.11%, at $71.29 a barrel.Prices had tumbled earlier as a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine kept traders concerned that an end of sanctions on Moscow could boost global energy supplies.U.S. President Donald Trump ordered commerce and economics officials to study reciprocal tariffs against countries that place tariffs on U.S. goods. Their recommendations are not due until April 1, allowing more time for negotiations with trading partners, market participants said.\"We saw a big recovery in prices on tariffs not going into effect until April,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group. \"That will allow time for negotiation.\"On Wednesday, Brent and WTI fell more than 2% after Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him. Trump ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.The oil price decline over the past 24 hours looks to be driven by a change from worries about tight supplies to concern about sufficient supply, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo, adding that some expect an increase in Russian energy exports.Russian oil exports could be sustained if workarounds to the latest U.S. sanctions package are found, after Russian crude production rose slightly last month, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its latest oil market report.The Ukraine news and Wednesday's U.S. oil inventories data offset higher U.S. inflation numbers that could drive the Federal Reserve to take a cautious approach to interest rate cuts in 2025, said PVM analyst John Evans.Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer and sanctions imposed on its crude exports after its invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago have supported higher prices.ANZ analysts said on Thursday that oil prices declined on news of the potential peace talks because of \"optimism that risks to crude oil supplies would ease\", pointing to the U.S. and EU sanctions.A build in crude oil inventories in the United States, the world's biggest crude consumer, also weighed on the market. U.S. crude stocks rose more than expected last week, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Wednesday.(Reporting by Erwin Seba, Enes Tunagur, Anna Hirtenstein, Emily Chow Editing by David Goodman, Kirsten Donovan, Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)"

        "content": "Italian authorities are conducting an inquiry into e-commerce giant Amazon. Three of its senior team members are suspected of evading taxes in the country amounting to 1.2bn ($1.26bn).Initial reports of the probe surfaced in 2024, but Reuters reports that the full scope of the investigation only became apparent following a report by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.Amazon stated: \"[We are] committed to complying with all applicable tax laws\", and highlighted its significant tax contributions in Italy, noting that it ranks among the top 50 tax payers in the country, with its 2023 tax bill surpassing $1.4bn.Milan prosecutors and tax police have targeted the Luxembourg-based European arm of Amazon and three of its managers.The allegations pertain to online sales in Italy between 2019 and 2021.According to the sources, financial repercussions for Amazon could escalate to 3bn when including potential penalties and interest.Central to the investigation is Amazon's algorithm, which allegedly facilitates sales in Italy by non-EU sellers, predominantly Chinese, without revealing their identities.This lack of transparency reportedly aids these sellers in evading Italian value-added tax (VAT).Intermediaries such as Amazon are legally held co-responsible for VAT non-payment by non-EU sellers on their platforms under Italian law, so this could have severe implications for Amazon's operations throughout Europe.The inquiry began in 2021 following routine inspections by tax officials north of Milan. A separate case from July 2024 has also been referenced by a source.Italian tax police have seized 121m from an Amazon subsidiary in Italy amid allegations of tax fraud and illegal labour practices.Amazon expanded its footprint in Europe with the opening of its first physical retail space in the centre of Milan, Italy on 12 February 2025.\"Amazon under scrutiny in Italy for alleged $1.26bn tax evasion \" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

It's also on a five-week winning streak, the longest since 2022.The Hang Seng's 11% rise so far this year has made it easily the best performing major stock market in Asia and is among the top globally. Germany's DAX index is leading the way with a 14% gain this year, hitting a record high on Thursday.Swiss, French and Spanish benchmarks are not far behind, having clocked double-digit gains so far in 2025.In corporate news, earnings from Hermes will take the spotlight in Europe, where investors are keen to learn whether the Birkin bag maker remains best-placed to weather a downturn in the luxury sector, given its wealthier customer base.Luxury goods companies have been grappling with their slowest sales in years, as consumers in China tighten their belts, although upbeat results from Burberry, Cartier owner Richemont and others have fuelled hopes the sector is starting the year on firmer ground.Traders in Europe may lock in profits after a strong run this week, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index closing at a record high every day this week and up almost 10% year-to-date.

Amid the uncertainty, gold (GC=F) set a fresh record  the latest in a series  as investors sought out less-risky assets, before retreating on Tuesday.Given that, markets are looking to Powell's two-day testimony in Congress, starting Tuesday in the Senate, for any hint to the Fed's thinking how the tariffs could affect price pressures.With inflation seen as persistent, the countdown is already on for January's Consumer Price Index reading on Wednesday and its wholesale counterpart on Thursday.

Markets are also trying to get a read on the potential implications for the US economy and monetary policy if the White Houses policies reignite inflation and subdue growth.Investors will be focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powells testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for clues about the monetary policy trajectory. Short-term inflation expectations have risen above longer-term ones to the widest gap since 2023, with the so-called five-year breakeven rate reaching 2.64% on Monday. That may support the case for a slower pace of easing, a scenario that, in theory, would be bearish for bullion since it pays no interest.Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,919.23 an ounce as of 7:50 a.m. in Singapore.

        "content": "PARIS/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - French automaker Renault and its Chinese partner Geely plan to announce a deal later this month on expanding their cooperation to Brazil, three sources said, as they seek new growth markets amid broadening global trade wars.The two firms created a thermal engine joint venture last year and have since also started selling cars produced in a jointly owned factory in South Korea.They are now planning to further expand their partnership to Brazil, and are working on a preliminary deal that they aim to announce later this month, the sources familiar with the matter said. They declined to be named as the talks are not public yet.Under the deal, the Chinese firm would start using Renault's Brazilian retail network as early as this year to begin sales of Geely-branded vehicles exported from China, two of the sources said.The deal would also see Geely taking a minority stake in Renault Brazil and using the latter's Curitiba plant to assemble vehicles there, the two sources said. It was not immediately clear how big the potential investment would be.Renault and Geely declined to comment. The plan for Geely to build its presence in Brazil by selling exported cars via Renault's retail network has not previously been reported. Les Echos had earlier outlined their talks on investment and local production.The move will help boost capacity usage at Renault's plant in Brazil, the French firm's fifth largest overseas market, and aligns with its broader plan to reduce its reliance on the European market.It would also help Geely, whose main export market is Europe, expand into new markets as it grapples with bruising price competition at home and hefty tariffs imposed by several developed markets including the U.S., Canada and the EU on China-made vehicles.Amid rising trade tensions and overcapacity in China, Chinese automakers have been exploring opportunities in markets such as Russia, South America, the Middle East and Africa for export growth.Brazil was the fastest-growing market for exports of EVs and plug-in hybrids from China last year, with shipments more than doubling to 152,000 units, according to Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.It also became the second largest market for Chinese new energy vehicles - which include electric and hybrid models - after Belgium, he said.In Brazil, Geely would sell cars under its own brand, unlike in the Korean partnership which currently focuses on a single Renault-branded model, the Grand Koleos, built on Geely's platform and manufactured in a Renault-controlled plant in Busan, South Korea.Technical details of the partnership in Brazil are still being considered, and one of the sources said that Geely could set up its multi-energy platform in the Renault plant to manufacture gasoline cars, hybrid cars and pure EVs.(Reporting by Gilles Guillaume in Paris and Zhang Yan in Shanghai; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jan Harvey)"

Hyatt will pay $13.50 per share for the remaining shares.\"We have respected and benefitted from Playas operating expertise and outstanding guest experience delivery for years through their ownership and management of eight of our Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara hotels,\" said Hyatt CEO Mark Hoplamazian in a statement.The deal includes debt, net of cash, and valued Playa at about a 40% premium to its market capitalization as of December 20, the day before the companies revealed they were in talks.Properties added to Hyatt's portfolio: 24 resortsThe companies expect the transaction to close later this year.Hyatt said it plans to sell off select real estate assets while maintaining management contracts. The hotel group wants to remain an asset-light company, while Playa owns some of its resorts. Hyatt plans to sell these by 2027 for an expected value of \"at least $2 billion.\"In a report, analysts at Truist Securities estimated that after asset sales, Hyatt could earn about $20 million a year in management/franchise fees.Expect non-Hyatt branded Playa properties to be converted to Hyatt brands. Hyatt already had a partnership to run and market a few Playa properties under its Ziva and Zilara brands. Now, it will have greater control over those brands.As Truist analysts noted, Hyatt would be better positioned as a larger company to handle the regional volatility that has challenged Playa, such as hurricanes.The premium luxury all-inclusive resort market has been a rapidly growing segment of the hospitality industry, and high-end travelers have seen increasing demand post-pandemic.Industry analysts see the deal as part of a broader consolidation trend in all-inclusive resorts, as major hotel chains seek to offer more points redemption opportunities to road warriors using their loyalty programs.What am I looking at?

The Darmstadt, Germany-based company said that no legally binding agreement has been signed and there is no certainty a deal will materialize.SpringWorks declined to comment.If the talks are successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, three sources told Reuters earlier in the day, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. They did not disclose the exact terms being discussed.SpringWorks' shares closed 34% higher on Monday, giving the company a market value of around $4 billion. The stock initially jumped nearly 49% on the Reuters report, and touched its highest level since April 2022.Merck's German-listed shares closed down 3.7%.Dealmaking in the U.S. healthcare sector is showing signs of picking up, after a slowdown in activity in 2024 as large pharmaceutical companies took a breather to integrate big acquisitions they completed the previous year. Johnson & Johnson last month agreed to buy Intra-Cellular Therapeutics for about $14.6 billion.Stamford, Connecticut-based SpringWorks, which listed its shares in New York in 2019, is a commercial-stage biotech firm that develops drugs to treat various forms of cancer, including rare tumors and uterine cancer. Its monotherapy drug for the treatment of desmoid tumors, which are dense, soft-tissue tumors, has been approved in the United States. The company is expecting the approval of a product that treats neurofibromatosis type-1, a rare genetic disorder, later in February.STRATEGIC BETA transaction for SpringWorks would rank as one of the biggest pharma deals for Merck in recent years and boost its efforts to build out its cancer treatment pipeline.Merck has suffered high-profile setbacks recently in late-stage drug trials, prompting it to halt development of head and neck cancer drug Xevinapant. A major trial testing multiple sclerosis drug Evobrutinib failed in December 2023.In its most recent quarterly earnings, Merck reported a 12% rise in adjusted quarterly earnings, helped by temporarily lower spending on drug development and a rebound in demand for its specialty materials.\"Given Merck KGaAs existing franchise in oncology, which constitutes about 25% of its healthcare sales in 2024, we see the potential acquisition of SpringWorks as likely complementary and giving potential for synergies,\" analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\"Most importantly, given the projected size of the SpringWorks products, we see the assets potentially more than offsetting the erosion from LOEs (loss of exclusivity) and competition that Merck is facing.\"Merck has not shied away from splashy takeovers in the past. In 2015, the company agreed to buy U.S. lab equipment supplier Sigma-Aldrich for $17 billion, its biggest-ever deal. In 2019, Merck acquired U.S. electronics materials manufacturer Versum for 5.8 billion euros ($5.97 billion).In an interview in January, Merck's CEO said a recovery in sales growth at its major businesses would allow the company to take a cautious approach to buying other companies, which are expensively priced.($1 = 0.9708 euros)(Reporting by Sabrina Valle in New York and Patricia Weiss in Frankfurt; Additional reporting by Milana Vinn in New York and Bipasha Dey in Bengaluru; Editing by Anirban Sen, Susan Fenton, Nick Zieminski and Leslie Adler)"

        "content": "Hyatt Hotels is expanding its presence in the mid-tier market and scaling up in luxury and lifestyle brands as part of a broader fine-tuning of its brand portfolio. The hotel operator aims to speed up growth in its global footprint, increasing fee generation from owners and franchisees.In a call with investors on Thursday, president and CEO Mark Hoplamazian laid out a vision for Hyatt's continued transformation.Luxury and lifestyle growth will continue to be very intentional, ensuring we protect the ethos of each brand, Hoplamazian said. At the same time, we see tremendous opportunity in the upper midscale segment.Broadly speaking, Hyatt has concentrated on the high end of the market for much of its existence. It also has a smaller array of brands than its larger peers.We have the most white space and opportunity for growth compared to our competitors, Hoplamazian said.Hyatt has made significant inroads in the midscale market by expanding its Hyatt Studios and UrCove brands. The company now has over 55 open UrCove properties, a brand developed specifically for the Chinese market. It's also set to open its first Hyatt Studios location in the U.S. this quarter.With more than 120 midscale hotels in its pipeline, Hyatt is positioning itself to capture business and leisure travelers seeking a balance between affordability and quality.High-end hotels, such as the openings of Park Hyatt London River Thames and Grand Hyatt Deer Valley, were key to driving Hyatts development pipeline to a record 138,000 rooms in the fourth quarter.We continue to see strong demand for luxury and lifestyle brands, Hoplamazian noted. That translates to higher loyalty engagement, greater spend per guest, and ultimately, higher fees for Hyatt.Executives said they expect Hyatt's net rooms growth to accelerate in 2025.Hyatts emphasis on portfolio diversification aims to drive long-term revenue growth by increasing fees per room. The company reported record fee generation in the fourth quarter, with franchise and other fees rising 27% year-over-year, fueled by its expanding management agreements and growth in high-value properties.By expanding in the right places and delivering a differentiated experience, were confident in our ability to drive sustainable, long-term growth,\" Hoplamazian said.Hyatt didn't provide more context for this week's announcement of a $2.6 billion acquisition deal with Playa Hotels & Resorts than it had already provided. The deal comes at a time when executives are seeing strength in resort performance.The deal is expected to unlock new management agreements for Hyatts Ziva and Zilara brands. The company intends to sell off Playas owned properties while maintaining long-term management contractsan asset-light approach that aligns with Hyatts strategic direction.  The acquisition positions Hyatt to capitalize on the growing demand for luxury all-inclusive experiences, while adding significant scale to its resort portfolio in key leisure destinations where development opportunities are limited.

        "content": "By Tom Sims and Patricia WeissFRANKFURT (Reuters) -Commerzbank said on Thursday it would cut 3,900 jobs and unveiled more ambitious financial targets as part of a strategy revamp designed to head off UniCredit's advances for a tie-up between the German and Italian lenders.The job cuts, mainly in Germany and expected to take place by 2028, will be accompanied by hiring outside the country, meaning the bank's full-time positions will remain steady at 36,700, the bank said.For months, Commerzbank's management, under the leadership of CEO Bettina Orlopp, has been working on the strategy update that she has said would reveal the \"significant value potential\" of the bank.The battle for Commerzbank, pitting one of Italy's biggest banks against the German establishment, has become a test case of the country's ability to fend off foreign suitors and prevent its financial centre from losing one of its few remaining big commercial banks.Commerzbank, the nation's No. 2 bank, is hoping that its raft of announcements on Thursday will convince its investors that it can thrive as an independent company.Deutsche Bank analysts called the new guidance \"bullish\". RBC called the new targets \"punchy\".Commerzbank, which is partly state-owned and has labelled UniCredit's moves as hostile, said it would incur 700 million euros ($730 million) in restructuring charges in 2025.It also said it would raise some of its 2027 targets.It now targets net profit of 3.8 billion euros in 2027, up from a previous goal of 3.6 billion euros. In addition, it now aims for a cost-to-income ratio of 53% in 2027, more ambitious than a previous goal of 54%.The bank's shares were up 1% at 0933 GMT, after gaining nearly 50% in the months since UniCredit expressed its interest.Commerzbank's strategy update follows a better-than-expected 20% increase in full-year net profit, a result the bank believes illustrates the success of its turnaround in recent years.\"Now it's about lifting Commerzbank to the next level,\" Orlopp said.Andrea Orcel, the CEO of UniCredit, shocked Germany's corporate and political establishment last year when his Italian bank - also that nation's No. 2 - snapped up a hefty stake in Commerzbank and began pressing for a tie-up in the most ambitious attempt yet at a pan-European bank merger.The job cuts will come through natural fluctuations and early retirements, the bank said, a move that avoids unsettling the remaining staff while underlining the bank's willingness to sacrifice some to avoid even worse cuts under UniCredit.Hiring will take place at its operations in Poland and nearby cheaper locations.The bank said it was on the hunt for targeted acquisitions and would focus on strategic partnerships.That contrasts with big deals in the works in Spain, Italy and elsewhere. The CEO of the Dutch lender ING told Reuters he was looking for acquisition opportunities, potentially joining a wave of takeovers sweeping Europe.UniCredit's Orcel, who has long considered a tie-up with Commerzbank, has said a combination between the two banks would be the best possible outcome, and said any offer could still be months away. He has not ruled out walking away.Commerzbank's management, employees and the nation's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, have all spoken against a potential takeover, but at least one big investor and some business leaders favour talks.Political defiance remains strong. Boris Rhein, the premier of Commerzbank's home state of Hesse, told a gathering of Germany's financial elite on Monday that UniCredit needed to give up.\"Nobody wants what you are doing. Withdraw!\" Rhein said.($1 = 0.9584 euros)(Reporting by Tom Sims and Patricia Weiss; editing by Rachel More, Christopher Cushing, Tomasz Janowski, Alexandra Hudson)"

The two companies did not agree to a sale, but agreed on changes to Bitfarms' board.Hopes have been high in the crypto industry that it will benefit from President Donald Trump's administration, which has sent encouraging signals that regulations might be relaxed.(Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh and Mrinmay Dey; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Rashmi Aich)"

        "content": "By Yoruk Bahceli, Emma-Victoria Farr and Samuel IndykLONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - As Germany heads to the polls next week, the message from investors is clear: it is the one big economy with room to spend more to boost growth and it won't be punished by financial markets if it chooses to do so.For now they are unconvinced that Germany's next governing coalition - whichever parties it contains - will take a radical step on spending and borrowing.But the case for change is strong.Germany's once-mighty economy has flatlined since 2019, while the rest of the euro area has grown by 5%, and the U.S. 11%, Goldman Sachs estimates.However, it is also the only G7 economy with debt well under 100% of output and, in contrast to concerns about high debt in the U.S., Britain and France, investors want to see Germany borrow more to boost its growth potential.Markets are watching to see if Germany will loosen a 'debt brake' rule that has stamped out new borrowing, an even more pressing concern now that U.S. tariffs threaten to hurt its ailing economy further and it needs to raise defense spending.\"If there's one country where actually, potentially you could (raise borrowing), that would be Germany,\" said Nicola Mai, who leads sovereign credit research for bond giant PIMCO in Europe, referring to the debt brake as a 'straightjacket.'Until Germany tackles its deep-seated problems, especially deteriorating competitiveness, questions about the status of the former powerhouse will linger.So, while political uncertainty could weigh in the short term, a battered euro and long-lagging European stocks have much to gain from a meaningful rise in spending.That doesn't seem to be on the cards, with just under two thirds of investors in a poll BofA published in January expecting only a minor debt brake relaxation.Mai, who also doesn't expect a change that would be a \"huge deal\", said PIMCO favours taking interest rate risk in European bonds, betting rate cuts, not spending, will drive markets.MUCH TO GAINConservative leader Friedrich Merz, expected to head the next government, has shown openness to limited debt brake reform.Expectations are muted, with European Union deficit limits also constraining spending potential.The debt brake currently constrains structural deficits to 0.35% of output.A December poll by Citi showed clients saw the ceiling rising to 1% as the most likely outcome. That's likely not enough considering that just making up the last decade's underinvestment requires investments of around 1.5% of output annually for 10 years, ING estimates.Danske Bank reckons debt brake reform will raise growth by around 0.2 percentage points annually in the coming years.The risk of no reform at all is real if the far-right Alternative for Germany and the neoliberal Free Democrats gain enough seats to block a constitutional change. Reforming the debt brake or another option - launching special funds to raise spending outside the brake - requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority.German 10-year government bond yields exceeded the rate on interest rate swaps for the first time last year , partly on expectations of higher issuance after its government collapsed in November.But bond yields have barely risen since then, a sign that higher spending is seen as manageable.Elsewhere, the question is whether spending rises enough to halt European underperformance.The euro is down 17% from a peak $1.25 in 2018, and neared $1 earlier in February.Societe Generale's head of FX strategy Kit Juckes said European policy choices promoting less growth than in the U.S, which has spent much more, have been one key reason behind that fall, with Germany a big part of that.He said he did not see enough signs of a policy shift to change his $1.04 euro target for the first half of this year.Andreas Koenig, head of global FX at Europe's largest asset manager Amundi, agreed, continuing to favour the dollar.RE-RATING?At first sight German stocks look to have been spared with the blue-chip DAX index's 45% return beating U.S. stocks over the last three years. Yet relative to forward earnings, it trades at a 38% discount to the S&P 500.Driven by international earnings, the DAX masks the pain in companies with higher home exposure. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks have lost 18% and 2% over that time period. Carmakers, once central to Germanys powerhouse, have slid 35%.Rameez Sadikot, portfolio manager at Antipodes Partners, said a new government could potentially lead to a \"multiple re-rating\" in European equities if it started to ease concerns around low productivity.But for now, he was \"cautiously optimistic\", citing the risk of gridlock.Dealmakers would also welcome more spending, given Germany has seen the lowest volume of mergers and acquisitions year-to-date since before 2010, according to Dealogic.They are in 'wait and see' mode for now, according to bankers and lawyers, although Alexander Kutsch, managing partner at advisory firm Roedl & Partner said debt brake reform would support activity.The question remains whether a new government can address Germany's key structural issue, a decline in competitiveness, quickly.Fidelity International's global head of macro and strategic asset allocation Salman Ahmed said it would take much more spending than expected to change Germany's economic model, adding he saw \"no consensus yet\" to improve competitiveness.(Reporting by Yoruk Bahceli and Samuel Indyk in London and Emma-Victoria Farr in Frankfurt; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe and Toby Chopra)"

Hical, a supplier to Raytheon Technology and Boeing among others, aims to double revenue to 5 billion rupees ($57.57 million) from its aerospace division in three years, said Yashas Jaiveer Shashikiran, joint managing director.JJG Aero, also in Bengalurus industrial hub, took 12 years to hit $2 million in revenue but soared to $20 million in the last six, said CEO Anuj Jhunjhunwala.The growth is part of an Asia-Pacific aerospace surge, with 2024 revenue projected to be 54% above 2019 levels, while North America and Europe remain 3% and 4% lower, according to Accenture Research.Earlier, we were chasing customers. Now, they are equally interested in evaluating Indian machine shops, Jhunjhunwala said, adding that contracts were being signed more quickly and onboarding processes being done much faster than ever before.The companies produce parts for landing gear, wings, fuselage, electrical switches and motion control systems essential for flight safety and performance.Leading Western plane and engine manufacturers, whose output has been constrained by strikes, production caps, and parts and labour shortages since the pandemic, say they want to source more from India to meet rising demand for air travel.\"India is the best solution to supply chain challenges, Huw Morgan, senior vice president for aerospace procurement at Rolls-Royce, said last week at an industry event.\"Our engine volumes are growing at around 20% and the traditional supply chains are just not able to support it,\" Morgan said. \"India is ... the best cost market.\"The British company plans to double sourcing from India within five years.The country is among the biggest aircraft buyers in the world, yet accounts for only 1% of the global supply chain market, according to the recently formed Aerospace India Association.\"Post-Covid, the global aerospace industry has reached an inflection point. While this shift began in 2020, aerospace is a slow-moving industry  it takes time for changes to materialise,\" said Aravind Melligeri of supplier Aequs.MORE PLANES, MORE PARTSIndia, the world's third-largest domestic aviation market by seats, is also among the fastest-growing, driving demand for maintenance services and parts.Massive aircraft orders from IndiGo and Air India are fuelling growth across the aviation ecosystem, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson told Reuters.Although Indian firms have long supplied the $180 billion global aerospace industry, they are now moving beyond basic manufacturing to higher-value work such as design, engineering, and system integration.Airbus in 2024 awarded its second aircraft door contract within a year to Indian suppliers.\"India is contributing more than 1 billion euros currently in the overall Airbus supply chain and we expect to double that. Every commercial aircraft of Airbus today has some part or component that is made in India,\" said Michel Narchi, head Of international operations at Airbus said.INDUSTRY EFFORTSIndias civil aviation ministry held a meeting last week with industry leaders about boosting component manufacturing, said AIA Director General Srinivasan Dwarakanath. The association represents both Indian and global firms.He said a key step towards real value addition would be the local sourcing of raw materials such as aluminium, steel, and titanium, eventually leading to certification of designs made by Indian suppliers.The AIA estimates that India's aerospace industry will capture 10% of the global supply chain market within a decade, with the global market projected to reach $250 billion annually by 2033.\"India also had the initial challenges of being physically farther away from the main markets of the U.S. and Europe. Engineering approvals, qualification timings, raw material sourcing - it took some time to build the ecosystem, but now India is all set,\" said Hical's Yashas Jaiveer.(Reporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Seoul and Joanna Plucinska in London; Editing by Gerry Doyle)"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum is testing a bold new strategy to lure the private sector to the countrys oilfields by sharing joint-venture profits, a sharp pivot after years of shutting foreign investors out of energy projects.Most Read from BloombergWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterSpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayCutting Arena Subsidies Can Help Cover Tax Cuts, Think Tank SaysUnder plans unveiled Wednesday, Petroleos Mexicanos will split profits with private-sector partners in ventures that may account for as much as 10% of the state oil companys output. The approach signals a clear shift away from her predecessor and mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who aggressively sought to minimize the involvement of overseas companies in crucial sectors such as oil and electricity.Sheinbaum, who was sworn in in October, inherited a state-controlled oil behemoth with falling output and a staggering debt burden of roughly $100 billion. Attracting foreign capital and expertise is seen as key to turning around Pemexs production woes and shoring up its balance sheet.Sheinbaum risks sending mixed signals to potential investors, however, if they perceive the new profit-sharing model to contradict recent changes in Mexican law that require Pemex to prioritize government policy goals over profitability.The new model will divide proceeds from oil developments that are left over after the recovery of initial investments and the governments 30% crude levy, the president said.That way, we guarantee that the private sector will recover its investment and collects its share of the profit, while Pemex collects its share, Sheinbaum said in announcing the new strategy. If Pemex decides it needs help from the private sector, theres a scheme established by law that guarantees profits for Mexicans, and that Pemex also profits.Although Pemex and the energy ministry are in the process of evaluating which projects could require private-sector participation, Sheinbaum said that such deals may involve as much as 10% of the drillers production.Last month, Sheinbaums administration presented the bill, which aims to streamline permitting and establish mechanisms for private sector participation in the energy sector. The legislation also would guarantee state-controlled energy companies Pemex and Comision Federal de Electricidad will retain their dominance in the domestic sector.The bill comes as Pemex works to lift itself out of slumping oil production, domestic refineries that operate at less than 50% capacity, and facilities beset by accidents, explosions, and oil spills in recent years. Chief Executive Victor Rodriguez must also manage a debt portfolio that includes some $20 billion owed to oilfield-service providers.Pemex is working on a financing scheme to pay those service providers, although the funds wont come from the companys 220 billion peso ($10.8 billion) budget for 2025, Sheinbaum said. The government is still in the process of reviewing claims to calculate total supplier debt, she said.Previously, the president has said Pemex will repay contractors before the end of March.The Mexican government doesnt want Pemex to sell more debt in international markets, and will use Finance Ministry resources to aid the driller, Energy Minister Luz Elena Gonzalez said at the press briefing.In the credit derivatives market, the cost of protecting the companys debt against default for five years fell to 4.47 percentage points a year on Wednesday, according to ICE Data Services. Thats a drop of 21 basis points, on track for the biggest one-day decline since Nov. 7.In the case of the financial debt, Ill clarify its coming down, Gonzalez said.

That organization will include a series of functions, ranging from security and operational integrity to global business services, the email said.\"The first critical focus will be to implement our new global functional structure, which spans across functions, divisions, basins and geounits,\" it also said.The changes come as the Houston-based company has been working on a cost-savings initiative, according to the source, and is preparing for tepid growth this year as its customers are more cautious about spending amid concerns of an oversupplied oil market.SLB had been undergoing some restructuring efforts in the past year and took $237 million in severance charges in 2024, according to its quarterly earnings report.It was not immediately clear how many workers would be laid off as part of the reorganization. Reorganized functions would be in place by the end of the month and personnel updates would be out by the end of the quarter, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter was not public.SLB employed roughly 111,000 people as of February 2024, according to a filing.\"As a global technology company, we constantly optimize and evolve our resources and workforce to drive value for our customers and stakeholders,\" a spokesperson for the company said.\"Adapting our operating structure and accelerating our efficiency programs are proactive, continuous processes that we follow as business conditions and volume of activity across our geographies and business lines dynamically change,\" the spokesperson added.SLB raised its quarterly dividend last month and accelerated share repurchases as its fourth-quarter profits topped Wall Street expectations.The world's largest oilfield service company has continued to operate in Russia, even as competitors left following the country's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Last month, it said its current business aligns with new U.S. sanctions but warned that revenue in Russia was declining.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Denver, Arathy Somasekhar and Georgina McCartney in Houston; Editing by Marguerita Choy)"

It is very complex civil litigation and costly so that will be a consideration,\" Slater said.If confirmed, Slater said she would advocate for adequate resources for the division.The DOJ sued Google for allegedly dominating online advertising technology markets, and won a landmark ruling in another case that found Google holds an illegal monopoly in online search. Along with state attorneys general, the DOJ has also accused Apple, LiveNation and Visa of maintaining illegal monopolies.Slater said at the hearing that she is committed to continuing to work with both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general.Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey who is the ranking member on the Senate's antitrust committee, expressed concern ahead of the hearing about how efforts by Tesla CEO and Trump adviser Elon Musk to shrink the federal workforce would affect the antitrust division's work.\"Any efforts by Musk and Trump to fire or push out federal employees charged with enforcing our antitrust laws will hurt Americans at a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, pay their rents and mortgages, and buy groceries,\" Booker said.Slater has worked at Fox Corp and Roku, and represented Big Tech companies at a now-defunct trade group called the Internet Association.

The fund, which was the first fund of its kind to report investing in crypto following the debut of bitcoin ETFs, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.Other large investment funds also boosted their holdings in the ETFs, which launched in January 2024.Tudor Investment Corp, a systematic hedge fund manager, reported its holdings of the iShares ETF -- now the largest of the pack, with more than $55 billion in assets -- climbed to 8 million shares, from 4.4 million shares. The value of those holdings also soared, reflecting bitcoin's jump in value, hitting $426.9 million, up from $159.9 million at the end of September. Tudor didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.An Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Co, reported its first foray into bitcoin ETFs in the fourth quarter, taking a 8.2 million share stake in the iShares ETF that was worth $436.9 million.Hedge fund Hunting Hill Capital had no exposure to these ETFs as of the end of the third quarter, but by December 31 had re-emerged as a significant investor, with positions valued at about $131 million by the end of the year.\"Weve been actively trading within the broader crypto ETF complex, and the timing of the third-quarter filing may not have aligned with when we bought and sold various ETFs,\" said Adam Guren, founder and chief investment officer of the firm.The ranks of those adding to positions included financial advisory firms whose clients have been eager buyers of bitcoin ETFs. Cetera Advisors and NewEdge Advisers were among firms that boosted holdings in several of the ETFs, including products offered by Fidelity, ARK Investments and Invesco.Other investors were more selective, the filings showed. Cresset Asset Management boosted its exposure to ETFs carrying lower fees, said Jack Ablin, the firm's chief investment officer.\"It's also possible right now to get attractive options pricing for collar strategies, allowing us to protect the downside while giving away less of the upside in exchange, on these bitcoin funds,\" Ablin said.The 13F filings are one of the few ways to get insight into how institutional investors are positioned at the end of every quarter.

And as the tech trade falters in 2025  with Magnificent Seven stocks in the red  Wall Street is on the hunt for pockets of strength.While healthcare was barely positive in 2024, the sector is having its best start to a year since 2013 and is tied for second place among large-cap sector returns this year, up 6%.\"I think the best hedge on tech is healthcare,\" said DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas on a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast.\"Tech and healthcare tech have really stolen the ball the past couple of years,\" he said. \"[But] healthcare got crushed last year on a whole range of issues  policy as well as fundamentals.\"Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Asset Management, also weighed in on healthcare in a separate episode of Stocks in Translation. He cites its poor returns compared to those of the US benchmark, the S&P 500 (^GSPC).Healthcares performance over the last five years is in the bottom decile relative to the S&P [500], Sohn said, adding, It's horrendous.Healthcare's meager 1% return in 2024 contrasts starkly with tech's robust 20% gain. Sohn highlights that since the October 2023 market bottom, healthcare has shed over $10 billion in ETF assets. Meanwhile, tech raked in over $30 billion.\"There've been massive amounts of outflows from healthcare ETFs, which tells me investors have left the space. They've deserted it,\" said Sohn. \"And so from a sentiment and contrarian perspective, I like that idea  especially if tech starts to falter here a little bit more too,\" he said in a nod to healthcare's attractiveness as a tech hedge.Like Colas, Sohn likes the growth aspects of healthcare, which dovetail with the sector's traditional value characteristics.If healthcare's rebound has legs, investors have multiple ways to participate, including biotech, medical equipment makers, and insurers. And one major headwind  GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic  may be fading as a sector risk factor.Healthcare equipment companies took deep hits on the initial GLP-1 rollouts as investors priced in fewer weight-related surgeries and treatments. Those names were just totally beaten down, said Sohn.But the tide is turning as investors realize it will take years for many of the GLP-1 downstream effects to materialize. \"[Negative] sentiment towards the GLP-1 stuff has cooled off, and youre starting to see some of these equipment ETFs really revive themselves,\" said Sohn.For investors looking to get their feet wet outside of tech, Sohn says investors can start with broad healthcare exposure. \"You're going to get providers. You're going to get equipment and biotech,\" he said. \"I think there's a good setup of data to start adding healthcare to your portfolio.\"Colas arrived at a similar conclusion and kept it simple: \"I think healthcare is really attractive here.\"Click here for the latest crypto news, updates, and more related to ethereum and bitcoin prices, crypto ETFs, and market implications for cryptocurrenciesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

That said, we are disciplined acquirors and are focused on delivering for Frontier shareholders at a time when our airline is performing well in a dynamic market environment.The offer from Frontier late last month was also rejected almost immediately by Spirit.Spirit said that it did offer a counterproposal to Frontier this month, but that was rejected. The Florida airline has a hearing in court on its reorganization plan Thursday.Spirit anticipates completing the restructuring in the first quarter.Frontier's first attempt to merge with Spirit was in 2022, but it was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block JetBlue's $3.8 billion proposal, saying that it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares. A federal judge agreed in with the Justice Department in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger bid two months later.Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed for bankruptcy protection in November after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.Shares of Frontier Group fell 3% before the opening bell Wednesday."

Currently serving as head of the private capital business in Europe and North America, he most recently led the 22 billion ($23.1 billion) raise of the fund EQT X, the company said.We will continue to grow existing business lines, London-based Franzen said by phone. The group is already a top three player globally in private equity and infrastructure, and we see exciting potential in real estate.Franzen said he has no plans to leave London for Stockholm having recently moved to the UK with his family.His appointment comes amid an aggressive growth trajectory at EQT since it became a publicly traded stock in Stockholm in 2019.Three years ago the firm bought Baring Private Equity Asia Ltd. for about $7.5 billion in what is the biggest takeover of a private equity firm by another in the sector. A year prior it spent $1.9 billion buying Exeter Property Group to gain access to real estate markets across North America and Europe.Acquisitive growth will be part of our strategy going forward, Franzen said.Citigroup Inc. analyst Nicholas Herman said in a note to clients that while the new CEO is relatively less well-known to the market, equally EQTs strategy is well-embedded (so we expect continuity).EQT shares fell as much as 2% when trading started in the Swedish capital on Monday.Franzen will replace Christian Sinding, who plans to step down at the next annual shareholders meeting after six years running the firm. Under Sindings tenure, the Swedish companys market capitalization increased from about 7 billion ($7.3 billion) at the time of its 2019 listing to 40 billion currently.EQT stock is up nearly 20% so far this year after the firm delivered a set of fourth-quarter figures that was well received by investors and market watchers. Analysts covering the company described the results as the best value-creating reporting period in three years on the back of strong exit activity and fundraising.We are now seeing a clear pickup in deal activity, Franzen said.Sinding will remain with the group when he steps down as CEO, chairing a newly formed group called the EQT Council that also includes Chairman Conni Jonsson.This is the next logical step for EQT and we now enter an exciting new phase with Per at the helm, Jonsson said.EQT said it is targeting 100 billion from the next fundraising cycle.--With assistance from Jonas Ekblom.(Adds comment on London in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) finished just above the flatline.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed headline consumer inflation rose more than forecast in January. \"Core\" prices  which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas  reversed the previous month's easing, up 0.4% over last month and 3.3% over last year, with both rates higher than in December.Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cardsThe surprise inflation print pushed back investor bets on interest-rate cuts in 2025. As of Wednesday, traders were pricing just one interest-rate cut, after pricing in two for most of the year. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added 10 basis points to hit just shy of 4.64%, its highest level in more than two weeks, following the inflation data.A fresh batch of earnings provided some clues to Corporate America's resilience. Kraft Heinz (KHC) shares slid after the packaged food maker's 2025 profit outlook fell short.

Robinhood's (HOOD) report is also in focus after the stock touched a three-year high.A hot inflation print on Wednesday pushed the 10-year Treasury yield up about to 10 basis points to 4.63%, its highest level in more than two weeks.And this led to the typical market action seen over the past year as rates rise. The market's most interest rate sensitive areas like Real Estate (XLRE) and the small cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) fell about 0.7%, lagging the 0.4% drop seen in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).At 4.63%, the 10-year Treasury Yield is now at a level where Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook could deliver \"bifurcated\" returns in which stocks that are sensitive to interest rate refinancing are hurt while those that see little earnings impact still perform well.\"Where you really see the impact of higher rates today is in leadership and the breadth of the market, which is pretty terrible,\" Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. \"All your rate sensitive areas are doing poorly. So when rates move up it tends to hit those more rate sensitive parts the most. And if they move up high enough like they initially did off the CPI report, it hits the whole market.\"Below, Kantrowitz breaks down the key levels to watch on the 10-year Treasury yield.

As seen below, several smaller AI-related stocks were in rally mode on afternoon trade including defense software company BigBear. aI (BBAI).While Wednesday's hot inflation print shook up how markets are viewing the Fed's path this year, the data doesn't have Wall Street calling for interest rate hikes just yet.Here's what two economists who don't see the Fed cutting again this year are saying about the case for interest rate hikes.\"Hikes remain unlikely, but they seem less inconceivable now,\" Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"We still think the threshold for hikes is 3% core PCE inflation and unanchored long-term inflation expectations.\"The \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index will be released during the last week of February. Core PCE showed prices increased 2.8% in December. \"While we continue to think the next move is a cut rather than a hike, recent events have raised the possibility that the Fed needs to hike rates in the second half of this year,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a research note on Wednesday.The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that housing inflation picked up in January on a monthly basis, reversing the easing trend seen in the previous month.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs rose 0.4% in January compared to the previous month and higher than Decembers 0.3% monthly increase. On an annual basis, prices rose 4.4% from a year earlier in January, slower than the 4.6% in December and the smallest 12-month increase since January 2022.As we saw through 2024, shelter inflation will continue to take time to get back to reasonable levels,\" Josh Hirt, Vanguard senior US economist, said in an email after the release.The rent index rose 0.3% in January, matching Decembers pace of 0.3%. Meanwhile, prices for owners' equivalent rent increased 0.3% for the month, unchanged from Januarys 0.3% gain. Owners' equivalent rent is the estimated rent a homeowner would pay if they were renting their own property.Meanwhile the lodging away from home index rose 1.4% in January after falling 0.5% in December, and household insurance accelerated 1.1% last month.We continue to hold the view that shelter inflation will eventually moderate over the course of 2025, Hirt added.Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:New and used car prices were mixed to start the year in Januarys Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, but used prices continued trending higher, with Januarys jump the largest since May 2023.New car prices were flat in January and down 0.3% compared to a year ago, whereas used vehicles popped 2.2% in January and were up 1.0% for the year.This comes as overall prices in the US rose 0.5% over the previous month, the largest monthly headline increase since August 2023 and a slight acceleration from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Year-over-year prices rose 3.0% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices.Stocks rallied off their lows of the day throughout Wednesday as the Nasdaq Composite narrowly crossed into positive territory around 12:30 p.m. ET.Tesla (TSLA) proved to be a key catalyst for the tech-heavy index as shares rallied more than 4%.Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani reports:CVS (CVS) reported fourth quarter and full-year 2024 earnings Wednesday, beating Wall Street's expectations and sending its stock up more than 14%.Full-year revenue came in at $372.8 billion, while fourth quarter revenue was $97.7 billion compared to Wall Street's expectations of $96.8 billion. The healthcare benefits segment, which includes its various insurance products, was down slightly, with ongoing Medicare and Medicaid headwinds, which have also impacted its peers, dragging the company's revenue.Still, its healthcare services segment increased, as well as its retail pharmaceutical business, at a time when the business model is struggling.When asked directly about President Trump's tariffs and how they could impact the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path, Fed Chair Jerome Powell admitted it's rather unclear.As he did during a Jan. 29 press conference, Powell stressed there is increased uncertainty right now as the Fed waits to hear what exactly happens with Trump's policy. He added that while tariffs could impact the economic outlook and cause the Fed to change its monetary policy plans, the central bank is also watching immigration, fiscal policy, and regulatory policy.Powell said they can't assess how any of those factors will impact the economic outlook until it's clear what policies are actually being put into place.For now, Powell said Wednesday's January CPI reading showed similar signs to what the Fed has been seeing.Powell said inflation is \"close\" to the Fed's 2% goal but \"we're not there yet.\"Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports:Donald Trump on Wednesday morning dismissed a higher-than-expected inflation report as \"Biden inflation\" after making another call to lower interest rates.The US president reacted to the release of the data showing headline consumer prices rose more than forecast by posting BIDEN INFLATION UP! on Truth Social.The post came just an hour after another post earlier Wednesday morning that read \"Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!\"Read more here.Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:A hotter-than-expected inflation reading at the start of 2025 makes it much more likely that the Federal Reserve will keep rates on hold for the foreseeable future, reinforcing a cautionary stance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bank policymakers.After the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose more than forecast in January, traders reduced their expectations for rate cuts in 2025 to just one  and not until much later in the year.\"It really does push the timeline into the second half of the year if things go well,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Fed economist, told Yahoo Finance.Read more here.US stocks fell on Wednesday as investors digested a hotter-than-expected January consumer inflation reading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were all off about 1%.New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics out Wednesday showed that a key inflation metric rose more than anticipated in January.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.4% over the prior month, an acceleration from December's 0.2% monthly gain and above the 0.3% economists had expected. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.3%, above the 3.1% economists had projected.Headline consumer prices also rose more than expected. The CPI increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase was above the 2.9% economists had expected.The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, ahead of the 0.3% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates.Read more here.The S&P 500's (^GSPC) record run could face a setback, according to JPMorgan Market Intelligence. The team estimates the index may drop up to 2% if the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rises 0.4% or more in January from the previous month.\"Expect the bond market to react violently as it shifts its view to Fed Funds not being restrictive, with the Feds next move more likely a hike than a cut,\" wrote Andrew Tylers team. \"Rising bond yields would push the USD higher, adding pressure on stocks.\"With CPI data due at 8:30 a.m. New York time, markets are on edge. A slightly hotter print could challenge the bullish outlook on US equities. The consensus estimate is for a 0.3% rise in month-on-month CPI.Stocks in Europe trod water on Wednesday, mirroring the muted tone in markets as investors prepared for a fresh reading on US consumer inflation.The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index inched up less than 0.1%, staying in range of fresh record highs thanks to solid earnings from the likes of Heineken (HEIA.AS, HEINY).In individual benchmarks, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) rose 0.3%, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris traded flat. London's FTSE 100 index (^FTSE) hugged the flat line.Gold (GC=F) continued to pull back from a recent all-time high on Wednesda, as traders assessed Jerome Powell's message that the Fed isn't in a hurry to cut interest rates.Prices of gold bullion dropped below $2,890 an ounce, falling for a second day, after a record-setting run toward the key $3,000 level.Meanwhile, gold futures slid almost 1% to around $2,906 an ounce, with the shine coming off the non-interest-bearing asset as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose.Prices for the metal have surged in recent days as investors seek out less risky assets in light of President Trump's push for tariff hikes.Economic data: Consumer Price Index (January); Real average hourly earnings (January); MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Feb. 7)Earnings: Albemarle (ALB), Biogen (BIIB), CVS Health (CVS), Cisco (CSCO), Dutch Bros (BROS), Generac (GNRC), Kraft Heinz (KHC), MGM Resorts (MGM), Reddit (RDDT), Robinhood (HOOD), The TradeDesk (TTD)Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning:CPI inflation on deck: What to watch with Fed cuts in focusTrump's crypto company launches strategic 'token reserve'Alibaba's shares soar after investors buy iPhone AI hopesAnalyst: Musk's OpenAI bid a 'distraction' dragging Tesla stockGold's record rally hits pause after Powell's speechBets on higher US rates face inflation data testWhy healthcare is the 'best hedge' if the AI rally cools in 2025China's AI-driven stock surge is gaining backing from Wall Street strategists, who believe the countrys emerging tech capabilities will help sustain the bull market.Analysts from Morgan Stanley (MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM), and UBS Group AG (UBS) predict that stock gains fueled by DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model will continue.Bloomberg reports:The global shock and awe over the Chinese startup has spurred a fundamental rethink over the markets attractiveness, challenging previous assumptions that the nation is lagging behind in cutting-edge technologies.Global investors are starting to reassess Chinas investability within the tech and AI space, after an extended period of limited attention, Morgan Stanley strategists including Laura Wang wrote in a note dated Tuesday. We expect the momentum to sustain in the near-term given global investors light positioning.The MSCI China Index has risen about 15% from a January low, outperforming its Asian peers this year. A gauge of Chinese tech shares listed in Hong Kong entered a bull market last week.The growing optimism has spurred a flurry of buy-side action, luring hedge funds and managers like Fidelity International. While China has a long way to go to prove that the AI hype can benefit the broader private sector, the buzz at least helped offset downside pressure coming from trade tensions.Based on the experience during the 4G, 5G and cloud computing eras, it would seem that we are less than halfway through the rally driven by DeepSeek, UBS strategists including James Wang wrote in a note dated Wednesday.Alibaba (BABA) stock saw a leap over 10% on the news that Apple (AAPL) is working with the Chinese e-commerce platform on breaking into artificial intelligence business in China.Bloomberg reports:The stock climbed its most since October after the tech outlet, citing one unidentified source, said Apple and Alibaba have submitted AI features for approval to Chinas cyberspace regulator. Shares of Baidu Inc., considered a candidate to provide AI services, were largely unchanged in Hong Kong."

        "content": "The Delhi High Court has ruled in favour of the government in a gas dispute case, ordering Reliance Industries (RIL) to pay $1.7bn (Rs147.63bn) over allegations of \"unjust enrichment.The court found that RIL extracted gas from state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporations (ONGC) adjacent blocks near its KG-D6 field off the coast of Andhra Pradesh state in India.The division bench comprising Justices Rekha Palli and Saurabh Banerjee overturned an arbitration tribunal's ruling and quashed Justice Anup Jairam Bhambani's verdict, which upheld the arbitral award in favour of the RIL-led consortium.The division bench said: We are setting aside the impugned order dated 9 May 2023 passed by the learned single judge, and the arbitral award passed by the learned arbitral tribunal dated 2018, being contrary to the settled position of law along the pending applications, if any, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.The case dates back to 2013, when ONGC asserted that its IG and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks, located next to RIL's KG-D6 field, shared a common gas pool.ONGC moved the court, alleging that RIL, which had already begun operations at KG-D6, was extracting gas that had migrated from its blocks.The government claimed nearly $1.6bn in costs, including interest, and $175m in additional 'profit petroleum' for the \"disgorgement of unjust enrichment\" by RIL until 31 March 2016.However, an arbitration panel, headed by Lawrence Woo, rejected these claims.Despite the arbitration panel's rejection of the government's charges and ordering the Centre to compensate RIL's legal expenses, the ministry persisted with its claim and approached the Delhi High Court.An independent study by US consultant DeGolyer & MacNaughton, ordered by the court, confirmed the continuity of the gas pool.Following this, a committee headed by retired Delhi HC Chief Justice A P Shah recommended that RIL should pay for the \"unfair\" enrichment.The tribunal had previously stated: \"RIL extracted whatever gas became available in the course of petroleum operations within their contract area. Reliance deducted the 'cost petroleum', calculated the 'profit petroleum' and shared the requisite portion of the profit petroleum with the ministry.\"The Ministry has not alleged that Reliance did not pay them their share of profit petroleum for the entire quantity of gas extracted by Reliance, including migrated gas.\"\"Delhi HC rules against Reliance Industries in $1.7bn gas dispute case\" was originally created and published by Offshore Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "content": "By Jamie McGeever(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.Asian markets go into the new week on the front foot, supported by the weaker dollar, an ongoing rebound in China, and a wider switch into global assets as investors rotate out of the 'U.S. exceptionalism' trades that served them so well last year.The main calendar event is fourth-quarter GDP data from Japan. Economists are expecting annualized growth of 1.0%, according to a Reuters poll, slightly less than the revised 1.2% expansion in July-September, with business investment making up for weak consumption.The dollar is at a two-month low, dragged down by the delay in the Trump administration's tariff proposals actually being implemented. President Donald Trump's ultimate tariff destination may not have changed, but the journey is taking longer than many analysts had perhaps expected, and that is giving some relief to markets and weighing on the dollar.The dollar is down four days in a row, its longest losing streak since August. Most key emerging market currencies are now up against the greenback year-to-date, apart from the Indian rupee.Emerging and Asian assets more broadly are getting a lift. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index has rebounded 8% in the last month, an impressive move but not a patch on Hong Kong stocks - the Hang Seng is up 20% in the last month and the Hang Seng tech index is up 30%.Bank of America analysts note that since Trump's inauguration on January 20, shares in China's big tech 'BATX' firms - Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi - are up 22%, while America's 'Magnificent Seven' are up 0%.WisdomTree's head of equities Jeff Weniger notes that China's 'Terrific Ten' group of top tech stocks is now \"crushing\" the 'Magnificent Seven. How much juice is left in this move?If DeepSeek shows that China is very much in the global AI race, this trend could continue - Chinese stocks are extremely undervalued relative to their U.S. peers, and as BofA analysts note, 'BATX' market cap is currently only $1 trillion compared with the Mag Seven's $17 trillion.Elsewhere in the tech/AI space, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Broadcom are each eyeing potential deals that would break U.S. chipmaking icon Intel in two, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.Meanwhile, fast-moving geopolitical developments around the Russia-Ukraine war are back on investors' radar. French President Emmanuel Macron will host an emergency European summit on Monday after U.S. officials suggested Europe would have no role in any talks on ending the conflict, a peace process that will seemingly be conducted between the U.S. and Russia.Leaving aside the politics of it all, the prospect of even an imperfect peace is pushing oil and the dollar lower, and lifting European stocks. Other risk markets, like Asian and emerging assets, should benefit too.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Monday:- Japan GDP (Q4)- Thailand GDP (Q4)- Indonesia trade (January)(By Jamie McGeever, editing by Diane Craft)"

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAIs board of directors has formally rejected an offer from a group of investors led by Elon Musk to buy the nonprofit that controls the artificial intelligence company for $97.4 billion.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegOpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musks latest attempt to disrupt his competition, Bret Taylor, OpenAIs chairman, said in a statement Friday on behalf of the board.Musk, who co-founded OpenAI a decade ago before going on to launch a rival AI startup, enlisted a group of wealthy allies for an unsolicited cash bid to buy the nonprofits assets. Other backers of the proposal included Valor Equity Partners, Baron Capital, Atreides Management, Vy Capital, Joe Lonsdales 8VC and Ari Emanuel, through his investment fund. Musk said he hoped to return OpenAI to being the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was.The offer was quickly rebuffed earlier this week by OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, who called it a tactic by a competitor to slow us down and stressed that the company is not for sale. Andrew Nussbaum, a counsel to the OpenAI board, also previously said in a statement that OpenAI was not looking to sell and stressed that the directors sole fiduciary duty is fulfilling the companys mission to build more powerful, hypothetical AI systems called artificial general intelligence (AGI) that benefit humanity. Respectfully, he said, it is not up to a competitor to decide what is in the best interests of OpenAIs mission.Marc Toberoff, a lawyer representing the Musk-led investment consortium, said the boards rejection of the bid comes as no surprise because Altman and Taylor had made statements shooting down the bid before the board had reviewed it.Of course theyre putting the charitys assets (control of the for-profit enterprise) up for sale. Thats what their reorganization is all about. Theyre just selling it to themselves at a fraction of what Musk has offered, Toberoff said Friday in a statement. Will someone please explain how that benefits all of humanity?Musk has repeatedly tried to derail OpenAIs plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business. The billionaire filed two lawsuits against OpenAI for allegedly straying from its founding principles and asked a court to block the ChatGPT makers restructuring efforts. A judge recently said she was reluctant to immediately issue such an order in a case pitting billionaires versus billionaires.In a court filing following Musks bid, OpenAI argued that his offer to buy the company undermines the very claim at the heart of his lawsuit  that its assets cant be transferred away for private gain. Musks lawyers said in a subsequent legal finding that Musk would withdraw his bid if OpenAI agreed to halt its conversion to a for-profit.Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, Taylor said in the statement Friday.Regardless of the outcome, Musks bid is expected to complicate the companys restructuring process at a time when OpenAI is in talks with SoftBank Group Corp. to raise a massive new funding round at a valuation as high as $300 billion.Currently, OpenAI has a for-profit subsidiary that is governed by the nonprofit and its board. As part of the planned corporate shift, the company is expected to pay out a fair value for the nonprofits assets. Previously, OpenAI said it will compensate the nonprofit in the form of equity.Legal experts have said regulators will be watching for what stake the nonprofit receives. With the $97.4 billion offer, Musk may have just raised the floor for how much OpenAI needs to allocate.OpenAIs board is on perfectly solid footing to say no to Musks bid, Robert Bartlett, a professor at the Stanford Law School and co-director of the Rock Center for Corporate Governance, previously told Bloomberg News. But that doesnt mean they can ignore the ramifications on what the bid means for valuing the assets of OpenAIs nonprofit.If OpenAI assigns a higher value to its nonprofit, that could dilute the equity of OpenAIs current and future investors.(Updates with comments from Musks lawyer in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets by Amanda Cooper.Another week brings another round of tariff surprises from U.S. President Donald Trump. This time, it's a 25% duty on all U.S. imports of steel and aluminium on top of any existing tariffs.Investors are selling off shares in major steelmakers, but so far this has been orderly and price moves have been fairly contained. Tariffs have become part and parcel of the \"Trump 2.0\" operating manual and although they carry the risk of igniting volatility, the market has become a little less hypersensitive to each individual headline.There are clear signs, however, in the commodities world, where physical raw materials actually change hands, that traders are preparing for trouble.The London gold market has seen traders scramble to move ingots to New York, which has pushed up short-term borrowing rates, out of fear that Trump could train his sights on precious metals as targets for tariffs - however distant a possibility that is.A similar dynamic has emerged in the copper market in recent weeks.Copper has traditionally been viewed as a good barometer for the health of the underlying global economy, given its ubiquity and hence the \"Dr Copper\" nickname.When the price drops, it is often a sign of trouble that demand is weakening from anywhere from the construction to the electronics industry. Although its track record for predicting recession is not perfect, contractions in copper demand have often preceded slowdowns in global growth.The copper price has rallied to its highest in several months, but analysts say that, right now, this has less to do with optimism over global growth and more with where traders are moving metal to stave off potential tariff risks.In particular, metal is leaving London Metal Exchange warehouses and entering COMEX vaults. Since Trump took office on January 20, stocks of copper in LME warehouses have dropped by 3,600 tonnes, while those in COMEX warehouses have risen by almost exactly that amount.In the meantime, the gap, or spread, between LME and COMEX futures prices has widened to $740 a tonne, its highest in around 35 years, as traders play the arbitrage - selling London futures in favour of buying U.S. ones. When Trump took office, this spread was below $240 a tonne.In a note today, Citi strategists take a look at different ways to trade global tariff risks and the COMEX/LME arbitrage is one of them. Funds have also increased their holdings of COMEX copper futures and options in the latest week.There are other bullish drivers for copper. Crucially, buyers in China, the world's largest consumer, are returning from the Lunar New Year holidays, which is fuelling the rise in prices.For all the correlation between metal demand and the health of the economy, \"Dr Copper\" may not be able to diagnose how severe the hit might eventually be.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:* Three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions* Quarterly results from McDonald's, Loews and Vertex Pharmaceuticals* AI Action Summit opens in Paris, France(Editing by Ed Osmond)"

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsThe stock market appears to have a case of the inflation jitters.The last few weeks of market action have shown a clear trend. Any news that could hint at higher-than-expected inflation in 2025 has sent stocks lower.For now, the concerns haven't been long-lasting. Friday's sell-off after consumer inflation expectations hit their highest level in more than year in the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers was nearly erased two days later.Similar market action happened Wednesday too. January's Consumer Price Index showed prices rose more than Wall Street expected across the board.Instantly, stock futures tied to all three major indexes were down more than 1% as markets quickly moved to price in just one interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this year, fewer than the two investors have been pricing in for most of 2025.This may still be too many. Some economists believe the latest inflation reading reiterates their stance that the Fed won't cut this year. And if anything, the idea of a rate hike this year is building steam; \"unlikely, but they seem less inconceivable now,\" Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Deutsche Bank's Matthew Luzzetti concurred, putting the odds on a cut rather than a hike but noting a \"raised\" possibility.(BofA's Bhave says it'd take \"3% core PCE inflation and unanchored long-term inflation expectations\" to see a hike.)But despite the window for a hike opening wider, there wasn't much carnage in the stock market itself when the closing bell rang. The S&P 500 fell less than 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite actually closed slightly in positive territory. So why no real sell-off?Perhaps there's something in the fact that markets are still pricing in a rate cut this year and even the economists who have begun talking about rate hikes note that it's not the base case. And all this keeps a part of the bull case for stocks this year intact as, for now at least, market participants don't believe the Fed is looking to make interest rates more restrictive in 2025.This would also play a role in what Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz believes is still the market's biggest fear: higher rates. Over the past year, a move higher in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) has often come as investors' hopes for rate cuts fade. Therefore, if markets move to price in rate hikes, a move higher in the 10-year Treasury yield could be expected.Kantrowitz pointed out to Yahoo Finance that the 10-year Treasury yield spiked as high as 4.66% before falling closer to 4.63%, coinciding with the slight bounce back in stocks on Wednesday, specifically in sectors less sensitive to interest rates. (The market's most interest rate-sensitive areas include Real Estate (XLRE) and the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT).)After Wednesday's move, the 10-year is now in a range, as Kantrowitz said in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, that could deliver bifurcated returns, where stocks that are sensitive to interest rate refinancing are hurt while those that see little earnings impact still perform well.Kantrowitz added that looking at market fears through the lens of rates also helps explain why tariff talk has given investors pause over the past month.\"At the end of the day, it's not tariffs that are the problem,\" Kantrowitz said. \"It's that if tariffs lead to inflation and push interest rates higher, that becomes the problem.\"So while the word of the day has been shifting from tariffs to inflation, the early story of markets in 2025 appears unchanged. It's still all about interest rates.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company said it expected to recruit IT talent for the next four years, adding 100 employees a year. It also said it would hire nearly 500 employees for franchise management.The company said it would also use the funds to enhance supply-chain capabilities, branding and consumer-engagement efforts and for other general corporate purposes.Goldman Sachs and UBS were the joint sponsors of the Guming deal.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Political fixer Bradley Tusks venture firm is taking a different tack with its latest investment push: Instead of doling out cash to startups, its offering advice in return for equity  and scrapping plans to raise a fourth fund.Most Read from BloombergCan Portland Turn a Corner?Why American Mobility Ground to a HaltSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterSpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayCutting Arena Subsidies Can Help Cover Tax Cuts, Think Tank SaysThe pivot will spare Tusk the pain of fundraising in a grisly climate for startups and VCs, and return the investor to his political roots. Tusk is the founder of political consulting firm Tusk Strategies and author of the 2018 book The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups From Death by Politics. He started the VC firm nearly a decade ago, after serving as campaign manager for Michael Bloombergs 2009 mayoral race and as communications director for Senator Chuck Schumer. Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.Tusks venture firm has backed companies including Coinbase Global Inc. and the electric scooter company Bird, and raised $140 million for its third fund in 2022.But his most successful startup bet came prior to launching the firm. In 2011, he accepted equity in Uber Technologies Inc. from then-Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick in lieu of his usual consulting fee as a political adviser. Tusk then helped Uber campaign to legalize ride-sharing in major markets across the US. Tusks Uber shares delivered career-defining returns reported at the time to be nearly $100 million.Its hard to argue with what I did with Uber, Tusk said. The equity-for-services approach was clearly the better route, he said.Tusk originally set out to raise $140 million for the firms fourth fund, he said. But in the process he decided that he would be better off offering political advice, instead of cash, to founders in exchange for a stake in their companies. The consulting-based approach allows him and his employees to reap the full benefits when a company exits, rather than sharing profits with the firms investors, or limited partners. Tusk will pay the firms employees out of his own pocket.Tusk is making the decision to ditch the traditional venture capital model during a particularly challenging moment for the industry. Rising interest rates have put an end to years of easy money for startups, and fund managers are having a much more difficult time raising capital from the endowments and institutions that typically invest in VC funds. Those institutional investors are grappling with years of languishing investments with VC firms that havent been able to show them much, if any, return on their money thanks to a dearth of exits, like initial public offerings or acquisitions.Several venture firms have reduced their fund targets as a result or shut down their funds entirely. According to a PitchBook survey in December, 8% of venture firms said they did not plan to raise a next fund, citing the ongoing correction in valuations following the pandemic-era stock boom.Tusk says performance was not the reason he forfeited fundraising. The firms debut fund, raised in 2016, returned almost twice the amount of money it invested, he said. Though he also acknowledged that the firm struggled to distribute capital back to its limited partners, or LPs, in recent years due to the lack of IPOs and the massive chilling effect the Biden administration had on tech company acquisitions.LPs dont invest in funds if there is no return of capital, and funds dont invest in companies when there arent exits, he said.Tusk also didnt enjoy the work required in running a venture firm. The things that are exciting to me are, How do you legalize a disruptive technology? he said. And not really portfolio construction, or, How do I help my portfolio company hire the right engineer?Traditional venture funds often pride themselves on helping startups with hiring or technical business decisions. Those are important things  they are very integral to VC  but they are not things ultimately I want to spend my time on, he added.With the rapid rise of artificial intelligence and the fast-changing Washington policies, Tusk believes theres ample opportunity to help guide startups through an at-times hostile political environment.Either I am able to convince politicians that supporting this tech is in their interest, or Im not, and everything else doesnt really matter, he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "Marriott International has seen continued strength in travel demand, particularly in international markets, and an 8% rebound in group bookings.Marriott, which operates over 9,300 properties worldwide, reported its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, discussing key performance gains as the group undertakes a major technology overhaul and expands its loyalty program, which added more than 31 million new members last year.\"Fourth quarter leisure revenue per available room was 6% globally and 4% in the U.S. and Canada, driven by gains in both room nights and average daily rate, with strength across all tiers from luxury to select service,\" said president and CEO Anthony Capuano.Marriott's net profit margin was 34%. It reported a profit of $455 million on revenue of $1.3 billion (after subtracting revenue it must pass on to its managed and franchised properties).The Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel operator showed strong pricing power. In the fourth quarter, it boosted rates without sacrificing occupancy. Its worldwide growth in revenue per available room, or RevPAR, came in at 5% year-over-year, well over analyst expectations. This was heavily driven by the company's properties outside of the U.S. and Canada.\"RevPAR [revenue per available room] has been excellent,\" said Leeny Oberg, CFO and executive vice president of development.The hotel operator saw especially robust international leisure demand in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\"There have been many predictions of the end of the run on leisure [travel bookings],\" Capuano said. \"Understandably so. Since 2019, you've seen a 40% improvement in leisure RevPAR.\"\"It's normalizing,\" he said, forecasting \"flat\" growth in leisure RevPAR this year.\"Group was the big winner of 2024, up at about 8% for the full year,\" Oberg said, referring to room bookings for groups typically for meetings and events.\"At the end of 2024, global group revenues were pacing up 6% for 2025 and 10% for 2026 on increases in both room nights and average daily rate,\" Oberg said.Marriott had a 6.8% net increase in room count worldwide last year. In the U.S. and Canada, about one out of every three hotel rooms opened in 2024 were in the Marriott system.It expects its net room growth to be between 4% and 5% this year.Executives sounded an upbeat note on their hotel development outlook. They saw a modest acceleration in new construction starts in 2024. However, new builds remained below 2019 levels partly because lending remained restrained.In 2024, Marriott saw the fees it charges banks for its co-branded credit cards rise 10%.However, executives expect the pace of growth in these fees to be \"a few hundred basis points lower\" in 2025. Its biggest partners are the card issuers JPMorgan Chase and American Express.An analyst asked about Marriott's appetite for additional tuck-in acquisitions this year.\"We will certainly consider a tuck-in acquisition,\" Capuano responded. \"The vast, vast majority of our room growth will be organic growth.\"Marriott added over 31 million new members to its loyalty program last year, growing to nearly 228 million members at year-end.Capuano said there was an opportunity to boost sign-ups among younger travelers by adding more of the types of properties they tend to visit.Marriott has, in the past couple of years, introduced three new brands (Four Points Flex, Studio Res, and City Express by Marriott) that are more affordable (in the \"midscale\" segment). As of December, it had over 300 open and pipeline properties in this tier, which should attract disproportionately more younger travelers than some of its upscale and luxury hotels have traditionally done.Marriott also plans to have more on-property promotions to encourage sign-ups.Marriott is embarking on a technology overhaul that will span its reservations systems, property management infrastructure, and loyalty program, with initial rollouts beginning in late 2024. It is expected to take \"a couple of years\" to implement globally, according to Oberg. The goal is to streamline operations and enhance revenue opportunities.The hotel giant expects benefits across key stakeholder groups: simplifying training for staff, particularly to attract younger workers. It also wants to drive both cost efficiencies and revenue growth for property owners through an integrated shopping platform for amenities like spa services, dining, and golf. (For context, read Skift's \"Hotels Will Start Selling So Much More Than Rooms.\")One analyst asked if Marriott had seen any sign that Canadian and Mexican travelers were canceling reservations for U.S. stays in response to recent tariffs-related political tensions. Executives said it was too early to say.Similar to its rival Hilton, Marriott sees the \"business transient\" segment of customers  think a traveling salesperson booking traveling solo  as the segment with the most opportunity. It's the only segment of guests that has yet to recover to pre-pandemic demand levels.Executives also noted the potential for special corporate negotiated rates to gain more ground in 2025.

        "content": "Commercial auto insurance provider High Definition Vehicle Insurance (HDVI) announced Wednesday it has secured an additional $40 million in funding from previous investors 8VC, Autotech Ventures, Munich Re Ventures and Weatherford Capital as the company looks to develop more data-driven solutions and discount programs for the trucking community.The company has raised a total of $87 million since its founding in 2017 by Chuck Wallace and Reid Spitz.As a part of this announcement, Spitz, former president of HDVI, will be moving into Wallaces previous role as CEO. Wallace will continue to advise HDVI. Alexei Andreev, co-founder and managing director of Autotech Ventures, along with Jake Medwell, founding partner at 8VC, will also join the companys board of directors as part of the deal.In an interview with FreightWaves, Spitz, drawing on years of experience in transportation-related investments at 8VC, recalled recognizing the chance to leverage data to improve trucking insurance policies and products during his time there.I saw an opportunity to bring trucking and insurance together and provide real innovation, he said. The core methods used for pricing and underwriting trucking companies hadnt changed. At the same time, there had been a tremendous amount of innovation happening in technology. Now, we are using telematics data to better price, underwrite and give fleets more flexibility in how they can control their own insurance costs.Spitz highlighted the increase in insurance costs for trucking companies, with a 45% rise over the past decade, driven by factors like inflation, nuclear verdicts and more distracted driving. Meanwhile, traditional insurance companies had not given trucking fleets full credit for the investments they had made in safety and equipment.To address those challenges, HDVI operates a full-stack managing general agent to handle everything from writing policies to managing claims. The company then uses telematics data to provide discounts of up to 20% based on the safety performance of the fleet, Spitz said.We also offer dynamically priced policies, where fleets can earn monthly discounts based on their safe driving. We provide a fleet safety portal and dedicated safety professionals to help customers understand their data and improve their safety metrics, he continued.The goal, according to Spitz, is to transform the relationship between the insurance company and the customer from a pure financial transaction to a true partnership in risk management. He shared that 90% of HDVIs customers had seen improvements in key safety metrics like speeding or harsh braking in their first year working with the company.He explained that the fresh capital would be used to fuel deeper product development, including investments in data, analytics and analysis to provide even more tailored pricing and discounts.Will Weatherford, managing partner at Weatherford Capital, said in the release: HDVIs innovative use of real-time telematics is reshaping commercial trucking insurance. This latest fundraise underscores the confidence we have in HDVIs leadership and ability to deliver profitable growth.Articles by Grace SharkeyUpwell secures $6.5M to automate logistics billing practicesFreight Hero exits stealth mode with backing from Dynamo and AI FundAuto Hauler Exchange secures $5M Series A, bullish on FreightTech marketplaceThe post HDVI secures $40M for data-driven trucking insurance appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "By Luciana MagalhaesSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian companies are scoping out acquisition targets in Argentina, while beefing up staff and stores in a cautious bet on President Javier Milei's aggressive economic reforms that are beginning to stabilize the crisis-stricken economy.Brazilian firms, including consumer goods, services, oil and tech, told Reuters they are looking to launch new ventures or drafting expansion plans in Argentina, which is emerging from years of economic chaos that had deterred investment.Milei's tough austerity measures have helped tamp down triple-digit inflation, overturn a deep deficit and rebuild reserves, boosting investor confidence. But the nation is still digging out of recession, while capital controls complicate business.\"Argentina is back on the radar,\" said Rodrigo Stefanini, CEO of Latin American operations at Stefanini Group, a Brazilian multinational technology company with global revenues projected to have reached some 8 billion reais ($1.4 billion) last year.The company's annual sales jumped 15% in Argentina last year and its workforce grew 10% to around 1,500 people. The CEO told Reuters the firm is looking at Argentine acquisition targets for the first time since entering the country in 1996, despite an economic outlook that remains uncertain.\"You don't want to be the first to arrive at the party, because you don't know if it will be a hit. But you also don't want to be the last, because the drinks may be finished,\" Stefanini said with a smile.\"It's time to take advantage of it, before the arrival of the Chinese and the Americans.\"Proximity and the perks of the regional Mercosur trade bloc have often put Brazilian companies ahead of the curve in riding the regular booms and busts of the Argentine economy, although several firms have also been burned.Around 150 major Brazilian firms have maintained a steady presence in Argentina, although some of those have scaled back operations over the years, according to the Sao Paulo-based Brazil-Argentina Chamber of Commerce.Federico Servideo, the chamber's president, said Brazilian companies are watching economic trends and policy changes - potentially including a loosening of currency controls - before ramping up capital investments in the next 12-36 months.\"There's indeed a reversal in expectations from Brazilian investors,\" said Servideo.FULL RETURN TO ARGENTINA?Brazil's state-run oil firm Petrobras is considering a new bet on Argentina after signing a memorandum of understanding with Argentine peer YPF last September to explore joint investments in exploration and production.Petrobras, which is already part of a consortium operating two concessions in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale region, told Reuters it is eyeing additional ventures.Brazil-based CVC Corp, one of the largest travel groups in Latin America, is already expanding in Argentina, where it first arrived in 2018. The firm opened 42 storefronts in Argentina last year and aims for similar this year.\"We've always firmly believed in the Argentine tourism market,\" CVC Corp Chief Executive Fabio Godinho told Reuters.Cambuci SA, Brazil's largest producer of soccer balls, footwear and apparel, recently secured a five-year distribution agreement in Argentina, after closing its local subsidiary in 2023 amid raw material shortages and currency restrictions.Chairman Roberto Estefano said the firm may fully return to Argentina within a few years.\"Argentina is an impressive country with about 44 million people who are passionate about sports,\" he said, adding that Cambuci would like to re-enter the market ahead of major rivals.Eduardo Kunst, CEO of Brazilian chemical manufacturer Artecola, which in 2023 suspended production in Argentina amid soaring operational costs but still sells in the market, said if the country's trajectory continues, the company may consider resuming local manufacturing.\"We believe that if Argentina continues on its current path, it can regain its significant role in the region,\" Kunst said.(Reporting by Luciana Magalhaes in Sao Paulo; Additional reporting by Adam Jourdan in Buenos Aires; Editing by Brad Haynes, Christian Plumb and Rosalba O'Brien)"

Many emerging market stocks and currencies are up year-to-date, also quite impressive considering the dark cloud of U.S. tariffs hanging over them.This resilience got a boost on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about starting negotiations \"immediately\" to end the war in Ukraine.That was enough to take the wind out of the dollar's sails, slam oil down 2.5%, cut Wall Street's losses, and push Asian equity futures into the green.While many money managers will have factored a potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire into their investment allocations this year, it's unlikely it has been fully priced across markets. All else equal, further progress towards peace should support risk appetite, and keep a lid on oil and the dollar.In Asia on Thursday, the main events will be an interest rate decision from the central bank of the Philippines and the latest wholesale inflation figures from Japan.The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is widely expected to cut its key policy rate by a quarter-point to 5.50%. Inflation appears to be under control, in the central bank's 2-4% target range since October, but growth is slowing.The Philippine peso has been among the weaker emerging market currencies, and is down slightly against the dollar year-to-date.The yen, meanwhile, had its worst day this year against the dollar on Wednesday but could rebound on Thursday if Japanese wholesale inflation figures come in on the strong side.Economists are expecting a rise in the annual rate to 4.0% in January. That would be the highest since June 2023 and strengthen the argument for further rate hikes.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Thursday:- Philippines central bank policy decision- Japan wholesale inflation (January)- Thai finance minister Pichai Chunhavajira speaks(By Jamie McGeever, editing by Deepa Babington)"

Companies typically fail to appoint administrators when they lack sufficient cash to pay the fees that would be owed to the bankruptcy specialists.RBG Holdings became the fourth ever UK law firm to float on public markets in 2018. Mr Rosenblatt, who helped to fund Sir Keir Starmers electoral campaign, has enjoyed millions of pounds worth of payouts from the company since it joined the stock market.However, its share price has fallen by more than 90pc from its peak in 2021. In the years following its initial public offering, the City firm pushed to expand its business but this costly drive has led to a series of multimillion-pound losses.Investor confidence has also suffered in the wake of a high-profile racism scandal that saw Nicola Foulston, RBG Holdings chief executive, ousted in January 2023.The chief executives dismissal came after Ms Foulston was accused by former Rosenblatt partner Noel Deans of using the phrase n----- in the woodpile at a business dinner.Mr Deans, an employment lawyer of Afro-Caribbean heritage, also claimed he had faced discrimination from Mr Rosenblatt himself after he took issue with the company founders decision to greet him with a fist bump on his first day of work. Mr Rosenblatt was ultimately cleared of racism by an employment tribunal last year.RBG Holdings collapse comes after an exodus of top talent from its two subsidiaries, Rosenblatt and Memery Crystal. Dozens of senior lawyers have left both firms.While RBG Holdings is being wound down, Mr Rosenblatt is seeking to continue conducting legal business via his newly founded firm Rosenblatt Law, which he set up in January. Forty of Rosenblatts most senior lawyers have moved to Rosenblatt Law.Mr Rosenblatt has donated thousands of pounds to the Labour Party. In 2023, it was forced to hand back a 16,000 donation after The Telegraph revealed Mr Rosenblatts firm was working on behalf of CTB Capital, a sanctioned Russian bank.Mr Rosenblatt is still RBG Holdings largest shareholder, with a 20.52pc stake in the publicly listed business.

We score each lender on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).For example, regarding mortgage rates, a lender with a lower score charged a higher-than-median mortgage interest rate for loans issued in 2023. A higher score would indicate that a lender granted lower-than-median home loan interest rates to borrowers in 2023.With total home loan costs, a lower score would indicate that a lender charged higher-than-median total home loan costs in 2023. A high rating would mean that a mortgage lender offered lower-than-median all-in home loan costs in 2023.What this means: Zillow Home Loans offered a higher-than-median mortgage rate of 6.75% but a near-median total loan cost of $6,708 to borrowers in 2023.Zillow Home Loans gives you plenty of opportunities to jump into a home loan prequalification application. But this is where things get fuzzy. Depending on where you enter the workflow, you may see one of three different screens  and move through a different sales channel.In the preapproval process, one screen begins by asking for your ZIP code. It says that your preapproval application will always be submitted to Zillow Home Loans, but perhaps to other lenders as well.Another identical page except for one word offers to prequalify you for a mortgage loan.A third entry point says you can prequalify in as little as three minutes. It, too, says you will be connected to \"loan officers at Zillow Home Loans or from Zillow's network of lenders.\"Whichever you choose  a quick but nonbinding prequalification or the more formal preapproval  it looks like you'll be funneled to Zillow Home Loans and other lenders.Dig deeper: What is mortgage prequalification?We found half a dozen mortgage calculators on Zillow Home Loans:Mortgage calculatorVA mortgage calculatorRefinance calculatorAffordability calculatorDebt-to-income calculatorAmortization calculatorLater, while looking to return to the calculator list, we got lost.

It says that with all the paperwork submitted, \"most lenders can process mortgage preapprovals in less than a day.\" That may be optimistic.Zillow does not require a hard credit check to prequalify for a mortgage loan. Prequalification is basically equivalent to saying, \"Maybe we'll make the loan.\" But yes, there is a hard pull of your credit for a preapproval. That's saying, \"Yes, we'll probably make you a loan.\"Zillow Home Loans says it uses bank-level security encryption and will never resell your information.Methodology:Yahoo Finance reviews and scores mortgage lenders with quintile scoring in five primary categories: 1) Interest rates. Using 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data comprised of 10 million home loan applications, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.Review of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.Advertisers or sponsorships do not influence ratings.Editorial disclosure for mortgages:The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

        "source": "Associated Press Finance",
        "content": "MULFINGEN, Germany (AP)  Germany needs a new business model. The old one, fueled by cheap natural gas from Russia and lucrative exports to China, is broken, leaving Europe's biggest economy mired in stagnation and angst about the future.Delivering that fresh growth strategy is going to be the biggest challenge for the government that takes office after a national election set for Feb. 23, seven months ahead of schedule. The nation that became known for the quality of its products has not seen real economic growth for five years.Multiple factors conspired to take Germany from industrial powerhouse to post-pandemic straggler: too much bureaucracy, a shortage of skilled workers, slow deployment of technology and a lack of clear direction from the outgoing coalition government are among them. Rising competition from China and high energy prices due to Russia's war in Ukraine were additional hits.We really need a more company- and enterprise-friendly politics,\" said Klaus Geissdoerfer, CEO of industrial fan manufacturer EBM-Papst. We have bright talent in Germany. We have good companies, but at the moment we dont have the awareness on the political level.Business criticism gets louder as election nearsWith 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in annual revenue and plants on three continents, EBM-Papst describes itself as the global leader in its field. The company reported last year that it was suffering in Germany in particular and experienced a 4.1% revenue decline in its home market.Geissdoerfer said EBM-Papsts heating technology division lost 18.7% of its sales through a clumsily handled push to get property owners to replace gas furnaces with less polluting electric heat pumps.The requirements of the Building Energy Act put forward by Chancellor Olaf Scholz three-party coalition were so confusing, people put off the upgrades to their heating systems or rushed to buy new gas devices before the law took effect, he said. That sapped demand for the ultra-quiet heat pump fans EBM-Papst makes.Consumers wondered, What is the right technology for my house? Geissdoerfer said. And so everybody said, 'If I don't have to, I better wait.'Geissdoerfer made a complaint heard across industry: Germany's bureaucracy is excessive. A 2023 law that requires public and private entities to combat climate change by reducing their energy use means EBM-Papst must assign employees to detail what the company is doing to comply, he said.So now, instead of implementing measures, they write and report, the CEO said, adding that the documentation work is a poor use of time at a company whose core business is energy-saving equipment. I really hope with the new government we can get this solved, because at the moment its too much.EBM-Papst is moving in the direction where economists say Germany as a whole should put its industrial resources: into green and digital technology. The company, headquartered in Mulfingen, a town of 3,700 residents in rural southwest Germany, is equipping energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers with efficient cooling systems for their servers. It also is working on incorporating AI features to help tech companies optimize their power use and to predict when equipment needs to be replaced.In the meantime, EBM-Papst is coping with Germanys economic malaise by shifting its investment focus to Asia and the United States. The company now supplies U.S. customers, for instance, from plants in Farmington, Connecticut,and Telford, Tennessee. Its moves to localize production abroad predate the coronavirus pandemic but give EBM-Papst a shield against any new import taxes imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.Ties to China and Russia put Germany in a bindOn top of the homegrown issues, international relations have dealt another blow. Russia cut off most of the country's natural gas supplies over the German government's wartime support for Ukraine. Electricity prices, a key cost for industry, have risen to 2 1/2 times higher than in the U.S. and China.Metalworking firm Mecanindus-Vogelsang Group, which makes precision parts for automakers and other manufacturers, says it pays twice as much per kilowatt hour for the electricity its German plants use as it does for its U.S. sites in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, and Lakewood, New Jersey. That's 100,000 euros in added costs and a gigantic competitive disadvantage\" CEO Ulrich Flatken said.To avoid deindustrialization, which is already taking place, we urgently need internationally competitive energy prices, Flatken said.Another shock came from China, which throughout the 2010s served as a lucrative market for German-made machinery and automobiles. Once Chinese companies started making those same products, backed by government subsidies, German exports suffered.Germany's economy contracted in each of the last two years. By the end of 2024, it was only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic. The U.S. economy grew by 11.4% during over the same period, while China's expanded by 25.8%, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.Complacency and depressionMarcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research, thinks complacency set in during the boom years of exports to China. German companies werent quick enough to respond to technological trends, such as the move to electric cars, he said.They enjoyed the success of the 2010s and they have been too slow in understanding that they need to change and adapt, Fratzscher said.As the economic woes drag on, mental depression has set in, he said. The pessimism is enormous among companies and citizens, and thats an important explanation why companies are not investing.Many business executives and economists argue that Germany's next government should work to loosen constitutional limits on debt so it can increase public spending on infrastructure and education. Fratzscher wonders if political leaders, like the economy, will falter in adopting new ways of doing things.For the past 75 years, Germany has been built very much on consensus, stability oriented, lots of checks and balances in the political system, and that makes rapid change very difficult, he said. We need to change the mindset, to understand we need to be much faster on economic transformations."

        "source": "Fortune",
        "content": "Over the past decade, more CFOs have moved into CEO roles as the position evolves to include greater strategic and leadership responsibilities. This trend reflects a growing demand for executives who can navigate economic volatility with financial discipline.In the first half of 2024, 7.1% of CEOs at Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies came from a CFO role, up from 5.3% in 2013.But while many Fortune 500 CEOs have finance backgrounds, the transition is not always seamless because the CFO skill set does not always align with the leadership, vision, and risk tolerance required to be an effective CEO.Historically, CFOs are counted on to be black and white and by the numbers, when in reality, a CEO is the one that has to navigate through the gray, says Jeff Herzog, president of executive recruitment firm FPC National. Successful CEOs are able to thrive in ambiguityan ability that often comes more naturally to those with broad, cross-functional experience rather than a narrow financial focus.Hardik Sheth, who leads BCGs Center for CFO Excellence in North America, warns that a CFOs financial discipline can become a liability in a CEO role. An over-reliance on numbers and quantitative thinking can create blind spots in areas like vision, talent, and company culture.Joanna Startek, chief commercial officer at leadership consultancy RHR International, echoes this concern, noting that many CFOs assume they are ready for the top role simply because they have worked closely with the CEO.Ive seen a lot of CFOs overestimate their readiness, says Startek. They sit so close to the CEO that they feel like they know what they need to do to drive the success of the company, but they haven't necessarily shouldered the burden of growth as well.Watching and learning from the CEO isnt enough. Those who successfully transition from finance chiefs to the corner office have already taken on strategy, P&L management, and operational responsibilities while honing strong interpersonal skills. CFOs who fail to cultivate a well-rounded business background and effective communication skills earlier in their career often struggle to broaden their expertise retroactively.Kathy Pattillo, managing partner at Boyden, emphasizes that soft skillslike being an attentive listener and having an engaging personalityare among the most critical traits of CFOs who thrive as CEOs.There are a lot of financial leaders that just plain dont have that personality, and you cant go to school and learn it.The role of the CFO as a cost-cutter rather than a growth driver also presents challenges for those stepping into the CEO position. In fact, CFOs-turned-CEOs are, on average, slower to drive top-line growth compared to those from other backgrounds. Research from Spencer Stuart found that only 8% of CFOs-turned-CEOs lead their companies to top-quartile performance, whereas leapfrog CEOsthose promoted from two or more levels downand divisional CEOs have significantly higher odds of outperforming.CFOs often have an analytical, risk-averse mindset, which is an asset for a finance chief but can be a hindrance in the CEO role. It is not just about managing numbers. CEOs need to make quick, forward-thinking choices that impact the companys growth in the long-term, says Cagr Alkaya, global chair of the board at Stanton Chase. CFOs who struggle to break away from risk minimization may find it difficult to succeed in the corner office.Admittedly, industry and company-specific needs also shape how well a CFO succeeds as CEO. CFOs-turned-CEOs are most common in financial, energy, consumer, and services industries, where businesses are heavily numbers-driven. However, in industries where innovation and risk-taking are essential, namely technology and healthcare, this career path is less common.Intels former CFO-turned-CEO Bob Swan exemplifies these challenges. While praised for his financial expertise, he struggled to drive innovation and respond to market shifts at the tech company, ultimately leading to Intels declining performance.Of course, no single factor determines whether a CFO will succeed or fail as CEO. Still, without a deep understanding of business functions beyond finance, CFOs-turned-CEOs risk critical knowledge gaps that could limit their effectiveness.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

The company rerouted its IPO application to London last year after its goal of listing in the US faltered.Representatives for Shein didnt immediately respond to a request for comment.Founded in China but now based in Singapore, Shein became one of the worlds most valuable startups thanks to its high-volume, low-cost fashion.

They also pose a challenge to the likes of Amazon.com Inc.But US President Donald Trumps policies have fueled uncertainty, including over the potential size and timing of Sheins IPO. His decision to scrap a so-called de minimis rule removes an exemption on tariffs for parcels carrying goods worth no more than $800, a blow to Sheins main business, as well as Temus.Shein, which was valued at $66 billion in a funding round in 2023 and as high as $100 billion in 2022, confidentially filed papers in June for a London IPO.

        "content": "(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella QiuInvestors handled the shock surge in U.S. inflation extremely well given already limited scope for interest rate cuts. Benchmark Treasury yields shot up 10 basis points overnight but stock futures are actually firmer. Even the U.S. dollar is struggling to sustain the upward momentum that usually accompanies higher yields.That is likely thanks to hope of a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia after President Donald Trump held phone calls with both countries' leaders to discuss the end of their years-long war. China is also pushing for peacekeeping efforts to end the war, the Wall Street Journal reported.The prospect of an end to sanctions on Russian oil increasing supply pushed oil prices down more than 3% since Wednesday. [O/R]Nasdaq futures rose 0.4% while S&P 500 futures gained 0.2%. EUROSTOXX 50 futures climbed 1%, leaving them up almost 11% this year.Shares are already at record highs in Europe, which is not yet in the firing line of Trump's global trade war.Meanwhile the euro has risen 0.5% to $1.0431, having bounced from a low of $1.0317 overnight even as Treasury yields jumped. It still faces heavy resistance at the January top of $1.0535.The European Central Bank has more room to cut interest rates given inflation has been better behaved than in the U.S. Markets are pricing in three quarter-point moves to a terminal rate of 2%, while expectations are for the Federal Reserve to move only once this year to a floor of 4%. Just a few months ago, investors were looking for a bottom near 3%.Over in Asia, one point of note is the 10% rise this year in shares in Hong Kong, the region's best-performing major stock market. Providing a boost is the AI-driven rally in global shares finally arriving in China, ignited by buzz around AI startup DeepSeek and benefiting mostly tech giants such as Alibaba.Next up, investors will be keeping a close eye on Europe's reaction to developments in the Ukraine war. Analysts reckon it won't be an easy process, with countries including aid donors Britain, France and Germany saying they had to be part of any negotiations on the fate of Ukraine.And then there's Ukraine itself. Being told to give up territory to an invader before the talks even start is not a bright beginning.Britain will have its fourth-quarter gross domestic product data later in the day, with consensus seeing a decline of 0.1% in the quarter. Investors see at least two BoE rate cuts for the year.The U.S. will have weekly jobless data as well as its producer price index, which could get more attention given the surprise surge in consumer prices. Forecasts are centred on a rise of 0.3% in the month for PPI.Both of them will feed into the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation - the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index - which could determine if Fed has room to cut at all this year.Key developments that could influence markets on Thursday:* U.K. fourth-quarter GDP figures * Euro zone industrial production data for December * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. PPI for January(By Stella Qiu; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

But the company says it follows fair-use principles in employing publicly available data to build its AI models.On Thursday, the Indian Music Industry (IMI) group, T-Series and Saregama India asked a New Delhi court to hear concerns about \"unauthorised use of sound recordings\" in training AI models that breaches their copyright.The companies' contentions in the lawsuit \"are crucial for the entire music industry in India, and even worldwide,\" they said in their filing, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters.OpenAI and the music labels did not respond to requests for comments on Friday.The music labels want to join a lawsuit launched last year by Indian news agency ANI that accused OpenAI's ChatGPT application of using its content without permission to train AI models.Since then, book publishers and media groups, some backed by billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, have banded together to oppose the company in the New Delhi court.Bollywood and Hindi pop music are big business in India.T-Series is one of India's largest music record labels which releases about 2,000 sound records or songs annually, while Saregama, more than 100 years old, owns a repertoire of famed Indian singers such as Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar.On its website, the IMI group says it also represents global names such as Sony Music and Warner Music.In India, the music labels are \"concerned OpenAI and other AI systems can extract lyrics, music compositions and sound recordings from the internet,\" said an industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is in court.The Indian companies' latest action comes after Germany's GEMA, which represents composers, lyricists and publishers, said in November it had sued OpenAI for ChatGPT's alleged unlicensed reproduction of song lyrics with which \"the system has obviously been trained\".OpenAI, which is grappling with new challenges from Chinese startup DeepSeek's breakthrough in cheap AI computing, opposed the ANI lawsuit on the grounds that Indian courts lack jurisdiction, as the company is U.S.-based, with servers abroad.The next hearing in the lawsuit, which is seen as shaping the future of how AI models use copyright content in India, is set for Feb. 21.OpenAI chief Sam Altman visited India last week, meeting the infotech minister, and discussing the country's plan to pursue low-cost AI.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"

        "content": "Happy Friday, traders. Welcome to our weekly market wrap, where we take a look back at these last five trading days with a focus on the market news, economic data, and headlines that had the most impact on gold prices and other key correlated assets and may continue to in the future.Gold prices are falling back on Friday morning and are likely to close the session with an intraday loss. But the fact that golds late-week slide is from a new all-time high and comes at the tail of another strong rally means the yellow metal is still positioned for a seventh-consecutive week-over-week gain.Condensing whats been an energetic week of trading, we would say that the last five days have seen the more recent driver of gold pricing the direct focus on the FOMC's rate policy for 2025 and beyond, given the expectation of lower rates is a positive signal for the value of precious metals has taken a back seat to golds more historical investment thesis: as a direct hedge against inflation and fears of economic uncertainty.Before determining this would be the weeks trend, it seemed Wednesdays CPI number could drive a strong sell-off in gold spot prices or at least add a strong enough headwind to keep a low ceiling on any rally. Gold had surged on Monday to new highs above $2930/oz as traders had the first opportunity to trade in real-time comments that the US President made over the weekend promising/threatening extensive new tariffs on imported goods. That prices eventually stalled after making the new high water mark, in whats become its own mini-trend this week, triggered a rush of profit-taking liquidations, and the yellow metal began to slide late Monday and through Tuesday until settling back near $2890 ahead of Wednesdays inflation report.On its face, we would have predicted that the increase in consumer price inflation reported in the CPI data (core CPI up +3.3% YoY vs. +3.1% exp.) would pull the table out from under gold as its a clear signal affirming the FOMCs plans to slow the pace of interest rate cuts to just two in 2025. Instead, after some pre-market volatility when the report first printed, we saw gold resume its rally and climb steadily higher through the Wednesday and Thursday US sessions, even notching another all-time high at $2935/oz in the spot market. The initial rally was evidently backed by investors shock and concern about re-heating inflation; not only how higher price pressures might destabilize what currently feels to be a very fragile global economy, but how the risk of the Federal Reserve needing to resume monetary tightening may as well. Fuel was added to the fire on Thursday, as the US administration again threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners by April.In Fridays trading so far, with little in the way of new inputs to market narratives and trends, weve again seen golds rally tailing off in the thin bidding above $2925 and traders selling off their positions for profit as a result. This liquidation has been more concentrated and steeper as a result, cutting golds spot price back to $2880. This could indicate some heavier resistance, for the time being, at $2900.Whether we see another attempt towards an eye-watering bid at $3000/oz next week will depend primarily on headline flow out of Washington and potentially the Fed. The macroeconomic calendar is light, thanks in part to Mondays US market holiday, the main event being Wednesdays release of FOMC minutes.In the meantime, traders, I hope you can get out and safely enjoy your weekend for the next couple of days. After that, Ill see you back here next week for another market recap."

Many analysts believe Trump's moves are simply negotiating tactics while investors are focused on corporate earnings.Pepperstone's head of research, Chris Weston, pointed to tailwinds from solid earnings at European companies and the view that European growth may be close to reaching a trough.Still, the mood remains fragile and things could turn ugly quickly, with worries over deepening trade tensions still looming large in investors' minds.Major U.S. trading partners have condemned Trump's latest tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen vowed \"firm and proportionate countermeasures\" in response to the move.Mexico's government and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau similarly expressed their discontent.In Japan, Industry Minister Yoji Muto said on Wednesday that the government had requested an exemption from the U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs.Gold's relentless rise to successive record highs hit a speed bump on Wednesday as the yellow metal pulled back, although the $3,000 an ounce level is still within sight.Fear over the inflationary impact of a global trade war isn't the only reason bullion is up 10% this year, but it's a big one.Central banks have been big buyers for months, along with investors seeking safety. Worries about U.S. tariffs on gold have also set off a scramble to get the stuff out of London vaults and across the Atlantic.Key developments that could influence markets on Wednesday:- U.S. inflation report (January)- Powell's testimony- Heineken NV earnings release- CVS Health earnings release(Reporting by Rae Wee; Editing by Edmund Klamann)"

        "source": "South China Morning Post",
        "content": "Laopu Gold, a Beijing-based jeweller known for its handmade accessories, has emerged as a favourite among affluent consumers, as global luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci grapple with tepid consumer spending in China and sluggish sales across the region.With just 36 stores in Greater China, the Hong Kong-listed company sold 3.5 billion yuan (US$482.7 million) worth of pure gold and gem-set jewellery in the first half of 2024, up 148 per cent from a year earlier, according to its interim report. Its net profit skyrocketed nearly 200 per cent to reach 588 million yuan during the same period.Laopu Gold's shares are up more than 550 per cent since the company's trading debut in June, reaching a high of HK$457 (US$58.7) on Tuesday.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.With gold prices on the rise for nearly a year and consumer sentiment remaining subdued due to a slowing China, demand for mass-market gold jewellery has been declining. But Laopu's performance is \"vastly different,\" in that it is \"focused entirely on the high-end market,\" said Richard Lin, the chief consumer analyst at SPDB International, an investment bank.\"Affluent consumers are not only less affected by broader economic conditions, but more importantly, unlike the average consumer who buys gold as an accessory or for consumption, they also consider the investment value of gold products,\" he said.Laopu's success is partly attributable to its pricing model. Unlike competitor Chow Tai Fook Jewellery - which sells the bulk of its gold accessories based on a dynamic pricing model that rises and falls with the yellow metal - Laopu follows a \"fixed price\" model, where prices remain unchanged though they involve a hefty mark-up to reflect the company's intricate craftsmanship.For Laopu, this means more profit. According to its interim report, the company's gross margin reached 41.3 per cent in the first half of 2024, compared to around 20 per cent for Chow Tai Fook.\"With the price of gold now around 600 yuan (US$82.30) per gram and likely to keep rising, many consumers are thinking, since we have to pay extra for the brand and craftsmanship anyway, we might as well choose Laopu given the quality of its products,\" said Lin. \"So fundamentally this is about brand power.\"Laopu's appeal among the young and affluent is also tied to its promotion of \"heritage gold\" - a type of pure gold jewellery that blends ancient crafting techniques, Chinese culture and design elements inspired by the Buddhist faith.Sheila Zhang, a Beijing-based financial professional, bought a prayer wheel necklace that cost around 20,000 yuan in January. She said her first impression of Laopu was that \"it's very different from the other brands\".Shoppers in an outdoor mall in Beijing. Photo: AP alt=Shoppers in an outdoor mall in Beijing. Photo: AP>The shop she visited at Wangfujing, a commercial district in the city centre, offers two main categories of jewellery: one featuring traditional Chinese and Taoism-inspired accessories, and another one focused on Buddhism.\"Overall, Laopu is very simple and clear in its offerings, which, compared to other brands that overwhelm you with options, surprisingly makes it easier to make a choice,\" she said. \"I liked it a lot, because its style is very unique.\"Zhang is not the only person who feels this way. On RedNote, the Chinese social media app that recently rose to international fame due to the US crackdown on TikTok, there have been more than 1.2 million posts featuring the hashtag \"Laopu Gold.\" These posts feature the intricate craftsmanship of the jeweller's necklaces and rings, as well as videos of long queues outside its stores.\"I'm loving this brand. I have to work hard to make more money,\" wrote one RedNote user named Yoyo Zaizai, who posted a picture of herself wearing a gold pendant. \"It's so beautiful. Once you start buying Laopu, you can't escape the 'pit.'\"With the price of gold hitting an all-time high this week, sparked by demand for safe-haven assets amid turmoil sparked by US tariffs, Laopu Gold stands to benefit. China International Capital Corporation projected in October that the company's net profit could reach 1.7 billion yuan in 2025, adding that in 2026, it could hit 2.3 billion yuan.But a downside risk looms. With the company's shares rising as gold prices have shot up, Laopu could lose favour among consumers when gold prices start to fall.\"When that happens, the question is whether Laopu's brand strength can offset some of the negative impact of the downward cycle of gold prices,\" Lin said. \"It is a possibility.\"This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

It's the biggest payday of the year for most people. Typically, 75% of Americans receive refunds each year.Though the IRS can mail you a paper check, the faster and safer way is through a free, electronic direct deposit, the tax agency says. Eight out of 10 taxpayers receive their refunds through direct deposit, but the IRS wants to push that number higher.

This can be a convenient way to manage your money by sending some of your refund to an account for immediate use and some for future savings.You can use your tax software to do it electronically or use IRS Form 8888, Allocation of Refund if you file a paper return. You can split your refund, in any proportion you want, and direct deposit funds in up to three different accounts with U.S. financial institutions, reloadable prepaid debit cards, or mobile apps.Note that beginning this year, you can no longer use any of your refund to buy I Bonds for yourself or someone else.  \"This option was costly and not frequently used. The mailing of physical savings bonds was also subject to fraud, theft, loss, and delays,\" the Treasury said. If you want to buy I Bonds electronically, you can do so through TreasuryDirect. If you dont already have an account, you can create one.Your refund can only be deposited directly into a U.S. or U.S.-affiliated account in your name, your spouses name, or both if its a joint account. No more than three electronic refunds can be deposited into a single financial account or prepaid debit card. Taxpayers who exceed the limit will receive an IRS notice and a paper refund.You can also choose to split your refund between direct deposit and paper check.Are you talking to me? Tax season opens! Do you have to file taxes? Why you may want to even if you don't.State vs federal: No tax on tips bill might not be necessary, Kansas House tax chair saysMost refunds are issued in less than 21 days for taxpayers who filed electronically and chose direct deposit.Through the IRS \"Where's My Refund\" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund, and when it issued the refund. The money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund.If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return, the IRS said.If you claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS by law can't issue those refunds before mid-February. It said it expects most EITC/Additional CTC-related refunds for early filers to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3, if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with the tax return. The Where's My Refund tracker should show an updated status by February 22 for most early EITC/ACTC filers.Yes. No matter whether you choose to receive a paper check or direct deposit into a single account or three accounts, you can use the \"Wheres My Refund?\" feature on the IRS website or call 800-829-1954.You can check the status of your 2024 income tax refund 24 hours after e-filing or after four weeks if you filed by paper. Information is updated once a day, overnight. Youll need your Social Security or taxpayer ID number, filing status and exact refund amount on your return.If you split your refund, \"Wheres My Refund?\" will include a message confirming that your refund was split but wont specify the amount deposited into each account. Itll tell you the estimated date of the deposits and, if the IRS adjusted the amount of your refund for math errors or other reasons, itll tell you the amount of the adjustment.Everyone's taxes are unique so it's hard to pinpoint. Though three-quarters of Americans get refunds, others owe money.Last year, the average refund totaled $3,138, IRS data showed, though that was down around 1% from the prior year.In the first five days of this tax season, the average refund is $1,928, up 38.2% from the same period a year earlier, but the number of tax returns the IRS has received is down 14%, the IRS said. The average direct deposit refund was higher at $2,069, 34.1% higher than last year. The IRS says it expects the numbers will rise as tax season continues.\"Many taxpayers were still waiting for important tax documents at the end of January\" that are needed to file tax returns, it said.Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

        "content": "Hong Kong's largest banks are likely to offer new mortgages to ease the burden on homebuyers amid elevated interest rates, but experts doubt that the trend would overcome the factors weighing down the struggling property market.HSBC, one of the city's three currency-issuing lenders, unveiled on Wednesday new mortgage plans offering a fixed rate of 3.18 per cent for the first three years, or 3.03 per cent for the first five years. In both cases, the rate for subsequent years is the prime interest rate minus 1.75 per cent.The bank had offered fixed-rate plans at 3.25 per cent for three years or 3.15 per cent for five years starting in September.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.With the likes of New World Development (NWD) selling new flats at its State Pavilia project in North Point and Kerry Properties offering units in Hava in Yuen Long this month, the latest mortgages mean more options for homebuyers.\"Large banks may follow HSBC,\" said Eric Tso Tak-ming, chief vice-president of mortgage broker mReferral. In September, Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Standard Chartered launched similar plans after HSBC, he said.Since then, however, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut base rates by a cumulative half a percentage point in November and December, in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve.The city's commercial banks have discretion over when to change their deposit and lending rates. HSBC's prime rate is set at 5.25 per cent, same as that of subsidiary Hang Seng Bank. The rates at Standard Chartered, Bank of East Asia, Citigroup, CCB Asia and other banks stand at 5.5 per cent.Competing mortgage plans in the market had rates 0.32 to 0.47 percentage points higher than HSBC's latest offerings, Tso said.For borrowers with a 30-year, HK$5 million (US$642,000) loan, the lowest available floating-rate mortgage plan is 3.5 per cent, or a monthly payment of HK$22,542 currently. The new HSBC schemes could save such buyers HK$883 or HK$1,291 a month during the first three or five years, mReferral said.A model unit shows features of New World Development's State Pavilia project in North Point. Photo: Handout alt=A model unit shows features of New World Development's State Pavilia project in North Point. Photo: Handout>\"The new fixed-rate plan can reduce the risk of mortgage-rate fluctuations, which has a positive impact on home sales,\" Tso said. \"It can reduce the cost of home purchasing, so buyers can easily enter the market.\"Hong Kong's home sales saw some improvement last year, but remained hobbled by high interest rates as well as an economic slowdown.Developers completed 24,261 new homes in 2024, a 20-year high, according to data from Centaline Property Agency. However, only about half of them found buyers, far lower than the 80 per cent sell-through rate recorded from 2014 to 2021, the property agency added.With uncertainty over interest rate cuts in coming months as well as worsening geopolitical tensions, some analysts have observed a \"more cautious\" stance among property investors.Ricacorp Properties estimated that sales this month were not likely to gain momentum after January transactions fell to a four-month low of 4,948 units, according to official data. The long-term outlook was also bleak, said Derek Chan, head of research at the property agency.\"The Hong Kong property market remains constrained by a slowing economic growth, high property prices and policy regulations, along with uncertainties in global interest rates and trade policies,\" Chan said.\"A single mortgage plan is unlikely to provide a huge boost to the overall property market. Significant support will only materialise if subsequent economic data improves or policies are further relaxed.\"On Wednesday, Kerry released the first price list of 120 units in the Hava project at an average price of HK$10,658 per square foot. The list comprises 67 one-bedroom flats and 53 two-bedroom units. The average price is about 15 per cent higher than a neighbouring project, Lai Sun Development's The Parkland, which priced its first 50 units at HK$9,278 per square foot in September.Meanwhile, NWD said on Wednesday that it received more than 5,500 cheques from buyers hoping to secure one of the 168 units for sale on Saturday at State Pavilia, which means about 32 buyers are competing for each unit.Additional reporting by Salina LiThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "President Trump's promise to curb inflation just got more complicated after January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in hotter than expected this past week.The report rattled markets, putting pressure on stocks while bond yields soared, as investors reduced expectations for an interest rate cut, while some even revived the possibility of a hike.But never mind a hike  a delayed rate cut alone could put President Trump on a \"collision course\" with the Federal Reserve, warned veteran economist Nouriel Roubini.\"Even just keeping them on hold is going to put [Powell] on a collision course with Trump, because Trump wants to cut rates now,\" Roubini said. \"We're already seeing those tensions, and they're going to build up.\"Just ahead of the inflation release, Trump urged the Fed to lower rates, posting on Truth Social that reduced interest rates go \"hand in hand\" with his tariff agenda.His call for lower rates comes despite repeated pushback from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who signaled once again this week that he's in no rush to cut interest rates. Speaking before Congress on Wednesday, Powell told House lawmakers, \"I would say we're close but not there on inflation ... We want to keep policy restrictive for now.\"And while Powell cautioned this week that \"it would be unwise to speculate\" on the economic fallout of tariffs, Wall Street remains skeptical of Trump's policy agenda. Roubini doubled down on his warning that the Trump administration's proposed policies  including tariffs  risk backfiring by adding to current inflationary pressures, while Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi warned consumers will \"shoulder the burden.\"\"Tariffs, protectionism, economic war with our friends and allies, and also with China, are inflationary and reduce growth,\" Roubini explained.And Zandi echoed concerns that Trump's tariffs will add to inflationary pressures, telling me that Trump's tariff proposals will fuel higher inflation, raise interest rates, and curtail economic growth  factors that would further \"complicate\" the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decisions.Zandi sees this risk elevated following January's CPI print, which showed \"disinflation coming to an end\" as prices increased across a number of sectors, including energy, food, used cars and trucks, and motor vehicle insurance.\"The broad-based nature of the price increases ... its something to worry about with regard to tariffs,\" Zandi said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. \"The disinflation that we had been enjoying is now over, and unfortunately we're not quite back to the Federal Reserve's target, so that's disconcerting.\"While the full scope of Trump's tariff plan remains uncertain, Moody's Analytics Global Macroeconomic Model projects that if tariffs on Canada and Mexico are fully implemented next month and remain in effect with no additional exemptions, plus the additional 10% levy imposed on China earlier this month, consumer price inflation would rise 0.5% within a year. Real GDP would be 0.6% lower during the same period.And the potential for a trade war poses a risk to equities. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs warned earlier this week that tariffs pose a key downside risk to earnings growth, estimating that every 5% increase in the US tariff rate would cut 2025 S&P 500 earnings estimates by roughly 1% to 2%.Meanwhile, Roubini, who sees the S&P 500 returning \"single digits\" this year under \"moderate\" Trump policies, warns that \"bad policies\" could force the Fed to stay on hold  a move that could raise the risk of a market correction.However, Roubini believes the likelihood of the Trump administration implementing \"bad policy\" is relatively low. He points to four \"guardrails\" that could prevent \"bad policy from becoming really bad\"  market discipline, Fed independence, strong economic advisers, and bond vigilantes  with bond vigilantes perhaps serving as the primary check on Trump.\"He cannot control investors ... and investors are going to punish [Trump] if his policies are bad for growth and increase inflation,\" Roubini added. \"Thats going to be the most powerful constraint.\"Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Melanie Burton and Aaditya GovindRao(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on aluminium are more likely to be part of a bargaining strategy than a long-term policy of his administration, said CEO Graham Kerr of Australian diversified miner South32 on Thursday.South32 produces aluminium in Brazil, South Africa and Mozambique, and sells a portion of its South African production to U.S. markets, Kerr said.\"The challenge, I guess, with all the tariffs is how long does it last... To me, it's a negotiation rather than a long term policy,\" he told an earnings call.\"The reality is, from our perspective, it probably won't impact our product placement too much.\" The company expects to produce 1.2 million tonnes of aluminium this year.South32 beat analysts' estimates for the half year, reporting an over nine-fold surge in first-half profit to $375 million, up from $40 million a year earlier, driven by higher aluminium and copper sales and strong commodity prices.That beat a Visible Alpha consensus estimate of $370.1 million.Shares of the company rose 2.5% by midday, compared with a 2% rise in the broader miners' sub-index.An uptick in aluminium prices, spurred by a constrained alumina market and supply deficit, led to the company's aluminium division posting an increase in underlying operating earnings of $160 million for the first half.Alumina prices however were expected to extend their fall to $400 to $500 a tonne, Kerr said, as supply constraints in Guinea and Australia eased.Earnings for the copper division also increased by $98 million, boosted by higher prices and lower labour costs.The Perth-based miner, which separated from BHP Group in 2015, declared an interim dividend of 3.4 cents per share, compared with 0.4 cent a year earlier.South32 reinstated its production forecasts for fiscal 2026, and slightly lowered them for this year, for its Mozal Aluminium smelter in Mozambique. It had withdrawn the forecasts in December, following civil unrest in the country.The firm raised its full-year unit operating costs forecast for its Worsley Alumina project in Western Australia by 5%. It this week received federal approval to extend the life of those operations to at least 2036.Analysts at Citi called the earnings results \"solid\", but said that cost pressures for the miner were still evident.However, South32 also trimmed its full-year group capital expenditure forecast, excluding exploration and intangibles, by about $105 million.(Reporting by Aaditya Govind Rao and Sherin Sunny in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich and Christopher Cushing)"

        "published": "2025-02-17T14:00:00Z",
        "source": "Mining Technology",
        "content": "Digitalisation is increasingly becoming a pillar of Australia's mining industry across upstream and downstream operations.Mining companies with digital ambitions are exploring a broad spectrum of innovations for continuous improvement, from AI to 3D modelling technology.In lieu of relying solely on in-house research and development (R&D), which can be insular and pose difficulties in terms of cost and scalability, university-led research offers access to expertise, specialised facilities and market opportunities.Collaboration benefits not only participating companies but the broader industry through long-term knowledge-sharing, with the Minerals Council of Australia identifying both miners and universities as driving the unprecedented rate of technological change across the industry.Australias mining sector is supported by world-class academic institutions conducting cutting-edge research on digitalisation, as the nation works to streamline production and maintain its position as a major player in the global critical minerals race.University of Queensland professor Mohsen Yahyaei tells Mining Technology that: Australia is at the forefront of mining digitalisation, setting global benchmarks in automation, AI and data-driven decision making.Indeed, Australian mining megacorps have pioneered digitally connected operations. Since 2019, industry leader Rio Tinto has been optimising its digitally automated rail network, AutoHaul, to transport iron ore from its mines in Western Australias Pilbara region. This is the worlds first and largest heavy-haul long distance autonomous train service.A report by Mining Technologys parent company, GlobalData, titled Development of Autonomous Trucks in the Global Mining Sector finds that Australia had the largest fleet of 927, far ahead of competitors China with 562 and Canada with 289, as of July 2024.Automated software processes and AI programming can also analyse geological and exploration data, performance data from machinery, and data on safety and production processes. Rio Tintos CIO, Dan Evans, previously told Mining Technology that this is vital for gaining competitive advantage.Digital twins are another burgeoning tool being used to meet the global raw materials challenge. Using data collected from physical assets and 3D models, a digital render can be used for process simulations to improve productivity and safety at mining sites. For several years, Australias biggest gold miner, Newcrest, has been working on digitally replicating its flagship Cadia mine in New South Wales.Australias BHP, the largest mining company in the world by market capitalisation, spent A$30.8m ($19.3m) in fiscal year 2024 on digital technologies including AI, the Internet of Things and automation, according to GlobalData. In its annual report, the company described digital technology as a \"key lever\".BHPs strategy demonstrates the level of investment required for comprehensive digitalisation. The Australian Governments Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) confirms that: Mining and resource giants understand the value of R&D. While [they] can afford significant investment, smaller companies may find accessing quality R&D services difficult.The Australian Industry Group tracked a 78% decrease in R&D investment from mining businesses from 2012 to 2022, pointing out that this has broader ramifications for Australias knowledge economy as the nation relies heavy on a small number of R&D champion industries, one of which is mining.As well as investment capacity, the adoption of digital technologies in mining depends on the availability of existing infrastructure and trained staff, presenting additional challenges for smaller operators.University-industry collaboration is combatting such imbalances and declines in Australian mining R&D towards an inclusive industry-wide digital transformation.Yahyaei confirms the mutual benefits of this relationship as: Academic institutions bring advanced research, modelling techniques and fresh perspectives. In turn, the mining industry provides real-world challenges, operational data and scalability potential.The World Intellectual Property Organisation's Global Innovation Index, which assesses the innovation ecosystem in 132 countries, ranked Australia 23rd in the world in 2024, highlighting the quality of its universities.The national mining industry has capitalised on this academic expertise, establishing an intricate R&D network of 65 programmes with Australian universities that have aided the development of digital tools.A key initiative is the Trailblazer Universities Programme. The federal government has allocated A$370.3m towards new research capabilities, commercialisation outcomes and partnerships.The University of Queensland is a key institutional player, hosting the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) and the Sustainable Mining Institute, which was established in 2001 by the state government and more than 20 mining companies. As JKMRC director, Yahyaei works closely with industry through the Future Autonomous Systems and Technologies (FAST) programme.He highlights the JKMRCs Mill Filling Inference Tool, a soft sensor designed for semi-autogenous grinding mills. Mid-tier mining company MMG Australia was involved in funding the solution, which enables miners to run mills at higher capacity without risking overload, reduces the need for manual measurements and predicts liner wear and slurry pooling to prevent unplanned shutdowns.Other digital mining solutions developed under the FAST programme include a 3D model for stockpiles and a suite of process control performance benchmarking tools to enhance automation in mineral processing.These are real-world outcomes of academia-industry collaboration, turning theoretical concepts into soft sensors and models that solve problems for mineral processing operations, states Yahyaei.Curtin University is another Trailblazer member and a heavyweight in digital mining R&D. It boasts many major mining partnerships including the BHP Curtin Alliance, which has established several cooperative research centres (CRCs).The developments produced by these CRCs cover data science tools for site maintenance, battery minerals technology, an integrated extraction simulator and a coiled tubing drill rig called RoXplorer.RoXplorer is a prime example of the broad reach of Australias collaborative ecosystem. Through the MinEx CRC, the development involved industry participants of Anglo American, BHP, Epiroc, South32 and Wassara, alongside Curtin, the CSIRO, South Australia University and the Minerals Research Institute of Australia. The drilling rig was then advanced with virtual reality and digital twin technology for on-site simulation.We find collaboration with universities is fantastic for early stage development, says Ivor Bryan, chief technology officer (CTO) of Draslovka Mining Process Solutions, which currently has a A$3m research partnership with Curtin University under the Trailblazer programme.The experience has been very focused on scientific quality, and we have overlaid that with some directional guidance on coming up with commercial solutions. We have now got technology that we are taking to market globally.The university-industry ecosystem in Australia has also birthed mining start-ups to channel promising R&D solutions direct to market. A notable example is ElectraLith, a spinout from Monash University that is backed by Rio Tinto. The company's CTO, Shaun Oosthuizen, tells Mining Technology that: \"The combination of venture capital and academic and industry support we received as a start-up significantly boosted our ability to innovate and grow.\"Blending academic innovation with mining companies real-world needs and applications enhances the chances of successfully commercialising industry-changing technologies and achieving sustainable growth in a highly competitive mining sector.\"Once a digital solution has been developed, there remains the challenge of commercialisation and successful adoption by both mining companies and the workforce.Australias miners have been historically slow in this process even as digitalisation has ramped up. According to the journal Mineral Economics: In Australia there is a huge lag, on average 13 years, between the release of a technology and its adoption within coal operations.\" This is cause for alarm as coal is one of Australia's two biggest mining commodities. Speaking to Mining Technology, Curtin IP commercialisation director Rohan McDougall explains that the university has set up a range of companies to service digitalisation in the mining sector based on research outcomes and outputs.He cites Scanalyse, a successful business established by Curtin that offers laser scanning and mapping technology with the ability to collect ten million spatial data points in less than five minutes to monitor site equipment. Australian mining clients include BHP, Barrick and Rio Tinto.In 2024, the A$18.6m Curtin Venture Studio was launched to provide researchers with access to capital, potential partners, mentors, infrastructure and equipment with the aim of fast-tracking innovation.As the range of digital mining solutions expands, Bryan identifies upskilling as a key challenge. The traditional miner needs a different set of skills than they would have had ten or 15 years ago.This is another area in which industry can benefit from connecting with universities as they deliver on their primary purpose: to educate.Queensland Universitys FAST programme offers training for engineers and operators in process automation. Curtin University also provides a course for industry professionals on applications of digital technology across the mining value chain.As well as facilitating professional development, university mining departments across Australia are training the next generation of industry workers in digital evolution. A notable example is the University of Adelaides Mine Automation module, which covers data analytics, sensors and remote control, simulation and digital twins. Future-proofing the workforce is crucial as Australia is one of several global mining hubs that is facing a pressing digital skills gap.Certainly, training people and providing access to the latest coding systems and software tools that are being developed will continue be done at universities, asserts McDougall.Australias mining industry is ideally positioned to continue benefitting from its close relationship with academic R&D networks and forge ahead on widespread digitalisation. Things are moving quickly, says McDougall. I am very positive about the interest of the mining sector in digital investment going forwards, because it has great potential to improve productivity and safety and enable remote operations.Bryan concurs. As a capital-intensive industry, mining has historically been quite conservative, but in the past ten years there has been much more openness to innovation and collaboration. He highlights R&D in sensing technology and real-time analysis as crucial themes in future digital progress.The possibilities of the university-industry relationship appear endless. In fact, Australias neighbour, Indonesia, another global mining giant, recently proposed a revision to its mining law to grant concessions for special licence areas to national universities. This signals the expansive and invaluable role academic institutions have in pushing the industry forward.Many challenges in mining are too complex for a single company to solve alone, confirms Yahyaei. As an independent and impartial group, universities enable cross-industry knowledge sharing and collaboration.This enables the development of open standards for digital integration, ensuring compatibility between different mining technologies so solutions developed in one company or mine site can benefit the broader sector.\"How Australian universities are advancing mine digitalisation\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "content": "Private markets are quickly becoming a popular investment choice in 2025. The growth in the market is not going unnoticed and big firms, including Lloyds Bank, are looking to state a claim in private markets.Lloyds Bank is one of the big players in the UK spending more times looking at private markets and examining the advantages.Tangwena Nelson, head of asset & wealth managers at Lloyds Bank Corporate & Institutional: We are seeing real momentum in the private markets space. With traditional asset management firms seeing an increased shift in demand from passive to active equity strategies, private equity, private credit, infrastructure and real estate are seeing the most growth.In addition, we are seeing a rise in demand from sovereign wealth funds and large family offices, who are keen to have more access to private markets.TN: Scaling is essential. Whether it is through technology or alternative investment capabilities, firms are either building or buying market solutions to compete. This has led to an increase in mergers and acquisitions in the industry, which can be an effective way for some firms to quickly build scale.To support growth, firms are also moving towards multi-product strategies to strengthen the services they offer to their clients. This focus on multi-product offerings, coupled with long-term partnerships, helps firms to diversify, reducing the reliance on transactional business.TN: The move towards private markets is a global trend.TN: Investors are looking for yield and this is leading to firms placing greater focus on private markets. As private markets become more democratised, the demand will continue to grow.TN: There will continue to be an emphasis on scale and building a wider product offering, and that will naturally drive consolidation across the asset and wealth management sector. This is accelerated further by increased regulation.However, there remain opportunities for specialist firms who offer best-in-class services.TN: Were committed to supporting the asset and wealth management sector. Were focused on being a trusted and strategic partner to our clients, helping them achieve their long-term objectives.Rather than transactional relationships, Lloyds is focused on creating and providing 360 coverage through a client-centric approach.

        "content": "U.S. industrial production increased more than expected in January, driven by a surge in utilities output due to cold weather that obscured underlying weakness in manufacturing and mining, which both declined. The Federal Reserve reported on Friday that industrial production rose 0.5% last month, surpassing economists forecasts of a 0.3% gain.The better-than-expected headline figure comes after a 1% jump in December, which was revised up from the initially reported 0.9% increase. Compared to a year earlier, total industrial production was up 2% in January.The industrial production report was choppy in January with obvious weather effects boosting utilities demand and weighing on mining and manufacturing, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. These short-term fluctuations will fade quickly.Breaking down the data, utilities output spiked 7.2% in January as frigid weather across much of the country boosted demand for heating. This outsize gain in utilities masked weakness in other sectors.Manufacturing output, which accounts for about 75% of total industrial production, edged down 0.1% in January after rising 0.5% in December. The decline was led by a 5.2% drop in motor vehicles and parts production. Excluding the volatile auto sector, manufacturing output dipped just 0.1%.The decrease in manufacturing output in January was held down by a 5.2 percent decrease in the index for motor vehicles and parts, the Fed noted in its release.The mining sector, which includes oil and gas extraction, saw output fall 1.2% in January following a 2% gain in December. The Fed attributed the decline largely to an 18.1% drop in coal mining.Looking at major market groups, consumer goods production increased 0.8% in January, with nondurable consumer goods rising 1.8% while durable consumer goods fell 3%. Business equipment output jumped 2.1%, boosted by a strong increase in the production of civilian aircraft. Construction supplies dipped 0.2%.Capacity utilization, which measures how fully firms are using their resources, ticked up to 77.8% in January from 77.5% in December. This remains 1.8 percentage points below its long-run average from 1972 to 2024.Manufacturing capacity utilization edged down 0.1 percentage point to 76.3%, staying 1.9 points below its long-run average. Meanwhile, utilities capacity utilization surged to 75.7% from 70.8% in December.(Chart: United States Federal Reserve)The mixed report suggests the industrial sector continues to face headwinds from high interest rates and a shift in consumer spending toward services. However, easing supply chain pressures and moderating inflation are providing some support.Manufacturing business surveys show many of the industrys leaders think they have more to gain than lose from protectionist economic policies, Adams noted, pointing to potential policy shifts that could boost the sector.Looking ahead, economists expect the industrial sector to gradually improve over the course of 2025 as interest rates potentially decline and global growth picks up. The Feds latest projections show industrial production rising 1.5% in 2025 after an estimated 1.2% gain in 2024.However, risks remain tilted to the downside amid geopolitical tensions, tight monetary policy and the potential for a broader economic slowdown. The manufacturing sector in particular faces ongoing challenges from tepid export demand and the lagged effects of interest rate hikes.2025 will likely mark a better year for manufacturing output after declines in 2023 and 2024, Adams said, while cautioning that a robust rebound is not guaranteed.Economists will be closely watching upcoming data on retail sales, housing starts and regional manufacturing surveys to gauge the health of the industrial sector and overall economy in the early months of 2025. The Feds next policy meeting in March will also be pivotal in shaping the outlook, as markets anticipate potential rate cuts later this year that could help bolster industrial activity.The January industrial production report paints a picture of an industrial economy that is, at least for now, holding up better than expected to start the year, even as significant weak spots remain.The post Better-than-expected industrial production data hides softness appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "Money can be tricky in marriage, but financial expert Dave Ramsey has a clear stance: married couples should combine their finances rather than splitting expenses. In a recently shared clip on X, Ramsey took a call from a listener who asked how married couples should handle money. His response was direct  there's no splitting, only combining.During the call, the listener asked whether couples should combine everything or split expenses equally. Ramsey firmly responded, \"You combine everything. There is no middle. The preacher didnt say, And now youre a joint venture.' He said, And now youre one.'\"Don't Miss:Which Bucket Do I Draw From First? Suze Orman Explains To 67-Year-Old The Best Order For Tapping Into Her Retirement AccountsThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement  How do you compare?According to Ramsey, treating a marriage like a financial partnership rather than a unified household can create division. He emphasized that money should be a shared resource in a healthy marriage, not something divided into separate accounts or obligations.Many couples worry about what happens when one partner earns significantly more than the other. The caller asked Ramsey about this, and he dismissed the idea that income levels should dictate financial control.\"Youre not a partnership, youre a marriage,\" Ramsey said. He gave his own example  his wife has not earned an income for 30 years because she stayed home to raise their children. However, Ramsey was clear that they don't see his earnings as solely his. \"It's as much hers as it is mine  spiritually, morally and by the way, legally.\"Trending: The average 401(k) balance soars to a record-breaking high  Here's how to know if your nest egg is keeping pace.For Ramsey, financial unity means that both partners contribute to the household, even if their incomes or roles differ. A spouse who earns more does not get \"more votes\" on financial decisions. Instead, both should create a budget together with shared goals in mind.Ramsey argues that separate finances can lead to couples growing apart rather than together. He encourages married partners to change their language from \"mine\" and \"yours\" to \"ours.\"\"If you change your language like that, what it forces you to do is it forces you to set goals together instead of having independent goals,\" Ramsey explained. \"Marriages are always growing together or theyre growing apart.\"He added a bit of humor, saying that the only thing in his house that isn't shared is responsibility for cleaning up after their dog  then it's HIS dog.See Also: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Heres how you can earn passive income with just $100.While Ramsey's approach is rooted in unity, some couples may find that a hybrid approach  such as having joint accounts for shared expenses and individual accounts for personal spending  works best for them. Every relationship is different, and what matters most is that both partners communicate openly and agree on a system that fosters financial trust and teamwork.Ultimately, Ramsey's message is about more than just money  it's about commitment. Working together as a team may be the key to long-term success for married couples looking to build a strong financial future.Read Next:Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

        "content": "Donald Trumps second term as US President is bringing policies built around the central principle of America First. In the area of international trade, new and wide-ranging import tariffs are being proposed that would directly impact US trade with many countries. In effect, they raise the cost to US industry and consumers of goods or raw materials sourced from overseas, making domestic sourcing more attractive on price grounds.A danger is that wide-ranging new trade tariffs imposed by the US on its imports of goods are met with the response of retaliatory import tariffs from other countries around the world. Economists say that a major round of 'tit-for-tat' international trade tariffs would reduce overall international trade volumes and negatively impact the world economy.Industries such as automotive  with its long, complex and internationally-based supply chains  are particularly exposed to such additional taxes as well as the potential additional administrative 'friction' generated as parts or finished vehicles cross borders and are subjected to new checks.Dykema is a US law firm with a practice group that covers the automotive and transport sector. We spoke to Laura Baucus, Dykemas Automotive Industry Group Director and Supply Chain Counsel, and Mary Beth McGowan, Dykema Government Policy Advisor, to hear more about the potential impact of trade tariffs and risk mitigation measures.JA: How serious could the consequences of new import tariffs be and where is the potential disruption going to be greatest?Laura Baucus (LB): Tariffs dont just raise coststhey have the ability to create contractual chaos. Some supply agreements dont specify who absorbs the hit, triggering pricing disputes and straining long-term relationships. Industries with deeply intertwined international supply chains may be particularly vulnerable. Tariffs which changesometimes dailyleave companies unable to plan. In the auto industry, where parts cross borders daily, this unpredictability could impact operations.JA: How can firmsespecially automotive suppliersmitigate the risks posed by additional trade tariffs?LB: A proactive legal strategy is key. Businesses should review their contracts to see whether they address tariff-related cost increases, whether price adjustment mechanisms exist, and if alternative sourcing is an option. Pricing clauses and force majeure provisions deserve a close look. Going forward, companies in the auto and other manufacturing industries can manage tariff swings by refining contract terms and building flexibility into sourcing strategies ['natural hedging'] to keep production moving, no matter how trade policies shift.JA: Would an international trade war damage the worlds automotive industry and its offerings to consumers?LB: It wouldnt do the industry any favours. A prolonged trade battle fuels uncertainty, raises costs, disrupts deliveries, and sparks supply chain instability. Legal disputes are bound to follow. For consumers, it is possible that this could mean higher vehicle prices, fewer model options, and slower rollouts of new technologies.Mary Beth McGowan: We will have to see how the situation unfolds, especially the ultimate resolution on the proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The threat of retaliatory tariffs and their impact on supply chains and prices is concerning to many.The auto industry has issued dire warnings. A wide range of voices, including those in the steel industry, have cautioned that the measure could backfire if applied too broadly. Excessive tariffs seem counterproductive to other administration priorities like bringing down energy and fuel costs.\"Trade tariffs: Automotive suppliers should review their contracts\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.

These tools, inaction and opacity, are not appropriate and must be subject to appropriate scrutiny or purged from the toolkit altogether.Bowman pointed to several areas she believes should be reviewed, including supervision, bank applications and regulation.She asked whether current supervision has led to a world in which core financial risks have been de-prioritized, and non-core and non-financial risks  things like IT, operational risk, management, risk management, internal controls, and governance  have been over-emphasized.Bowman said regulators need to take a step back on the entire bank regulatory system and ask what is working, what is broken, and what needs to be updated.When a bank requests feedback and engages in good faith to provide information and respond to reasonable questions, regulators have an obligation to provide a clear response, she said.Bowman also called for a specialized resource that can be used by any of the Fed reserve banks during pre-filing conversations with new bank applicants with the goal of identifying and finding achievable pathways to yes. She also said some of the same issues come up in merger applications.In my view, the purgatory of a long application process is another form of regulatory inaction that must be eliminated, she said.Monetary PolicyBowman also touched on monetary policy in her remarks and said it is now in a good place. She said while core measures of inflation are elevated, she expects the rate of price changes to moderate further this year.Bowman cited upside risks and noted that progress back to the 2% target has been slow and uneven. The core consumer price index remained elevated in January, rising 3.3% for the year.Having entered a new phase in the process of moving the federal funds rate toward a more neutral policy stance, there are a few considerations that lead me to prefer a cautious and gradual approach, she said. Given the current policy stance, I think that easier financial conditions from higher equity prices over the past year may have slowed progress on disinflation.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "By Howard SchneiderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said on Monday she wanted increased conviction that inflation will decline further this year before lowering interest rates again, particularly given uncertainty around the impact of the Trump administration's new trade and other policies.\"I would like to gain greater confidence that progress in lowering inflation will continue as we consider making further adjustments,\" to a policy rate that the Fed is currently holding steady in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, Bowman said in remarks prepared for delivery to an American Bankers Association conference.The benchmark interest rate \"is now in a good place, allowing the committee to be patient and pay closer attention to the inflation data as it evolves,\" she said, referring to the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.Holding rates steady for now \"also provides the opportunity to review further indicators of economic activity and get further clarity on the administration's policies and their effects on the economy,\" she said.\"It will be very important to have a better sense of these policies, how they will be implemented, and establish greater confidence about how the economy will respond in the coming weeks and months,\" she said.President Donald Trump, since taking office last month for his second term, has issued a blizzard of orders on trade and tariffs, but has also turned around in some cases and rescinded tariffs.Bowman, appointed by Trump during his first term, has been among the most hawkish at the Fed in her approach to inflation. She said she does expect inflation to slow further this year, with an upcoming report on the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy costs expected to have dropped from 2.8% in December to 2.6% in January. The PCE is the Fed's favored inflation gauge.The expected inflation rate remains above the Fed's 2% target, and Bowman noted that the current 4% unemployment rate is below her estimate of full employment, while wages are expanding faster than what she regards as consistent with the central bank's inflation goal.Inflation \"has appeared to resume its downward path, and my baseline expectation has been that it will moderate further this year,\" she said. Even so, she added, \"there are upside risks...for the inflation path.\"The Fed is expected to hold the benchmark interest rate steady at its upcoming March meeting as policymakers watch the impact in particular of the import tariffs Trump has proposed or implemented so far.(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

        "content": "A British hotel tycoon is buying a 6m life insurance policy to protect his fortune from Rachel Reevess inheritance tax raid.Steve Perez, who owns a string of upmarket restaurants and hotels in the East Midlands, as well as the drinks company Global Brands, said he is taking the steps to ensure his family is not forced to sell parts of his business empire if he dies.It comes after the Chancellor unveiled a string of changes to inheritance tax rules during her maiden Budget, including slashing relief for business assets.Mr Perez said: Im 68, and come April next year, my business potentially will have a huge, huge tax bill.He added that in order to keep the business going not necessarily for [his] heirs benefit but for the employees benefit and to protect the business, he is taking out a life insurance policy costing him about 6m.He added: I built this business up from the back of a van and we now employ 400 people in Derbyshire. I suspect if the business had to be sold, it would go to a foreign corporation, or it would go to a private equity type of business which wouldnt care about the local area and employees as I do.Instead of investing the money back into the business, Im having to take money out of the business to pay the life insurance policy, just in case I die while these laws are in place.Mr Perez founded the drinks company Global Brands in 1997 after creating the vodka cocktail drink VK.He later expanded into hospitality, building the Casa Hotel and buying the Peak Edge Hotel, both in Chesterfield. In his spare time, he is a competitive rally driver.He is among many British business owners grappling with changes to inheritance tax laws.Under previous rules, properties used for business purposes could be passed down without incurring inheritance tax. From next April, however, properties with a value of more than 1m will pay a 20pc rate.Bosses have argued that the changes discourage investment, warning that many family-owned businesses be forced to sell up if they cannot pay the levy.Farmers in particular have been incensed by the Chancellors decision to axe tax relief for agricultural properties worth over 1m.Insurers have reported a rise in individuals looking to take out policies in the wake of the Budget. Life assurance policies pay out when the holder dies, while insurance pays out if the holder dies within a specified period.Mr Perezs policy will cover him for 10 years: Should it not be changed in the next 10 years, hopefully, well get a government in, whoever it might be, wholl see common sense.However, given the size of his business empire, he said his initial 6m policy would not be big enough to pay for his inheritance tax bill if he died.He said: Thats the first quote Ive had, but Im probably going to have to increase that to at least 10m. Ive got no incentive to grow the business now. In fact, its a disincentive to grow the business because its going to cost me more.Ive got potential greater inheritance tax liability, and now the bigger the business grows, the more Im going to have to pay out in life insurance.The Treasury was contacted for comment.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence is transforming financial fraud at an alarming pace, making scams more sophisticated and harder to detect. While fraud attempts have surged by 80% in the past three years, just 22% of firms have AI-powered defences in place. Stuart Wilkie, Head of Commercial Finance at Anglo Scottish Finance, explores the evolving threat landscape and how institutions  and individuals  can fight back.Tackling financial fraud has become more difficult than ever in recent years, thanks to the increasing prevalence of AI (artificial intelligence). A recent report from Signicat has highlighted the prevalence of AI in the murky world of financial fraud, suggesting that AI now accounts for 42% of all financial fraud attempts  while just 22% of firms have AI defences in place. This disconnect is worrying, but sadly, its nothing new.Both before and after the introduction of ChatGPT, the worlds most popular AI chatbot, in late 2022, the use of AI in financial fraud tactics has been on the increase. A 2022 report from Cifas found an 84% increase in the number of cases where AI was used to try and attack banks security systems.AI has made it easier for grifters to carry out their fraudulent activity, which has in turn resulted in an increase in overall fraud incidence. Signicats report also uncovered that the volume of fraud attempts is increasing rapidly, with total fraud attempts up by 80% over the last three years. This is in part due to the role AI plays in making it easier to complete financial fraud schemes but is also attributable to external factors.So, what are some of the most common forms of AI-fuelled financial fraud and how does one combat AI fraud at an individual and institutional level?The majority of AI-aided financial fraud can be categorised as synthetic identity fraud. Under this scam, fraudsters use AI to create fake identities comprised of a combination of real and fake information, before signing up for loans, lines of credit or even applying for benefits.AIs ability to quickly identify patterns within large datasets has given fraudsters the ability to create realistic profiles that align with demographic trends. Generative AI is also used in the identity creation process, simulating a realistic credit history. These profiles are therefore near-impossible to distinguish from real people under standard verification checks.A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that more than 80% of new account fraud can be attributed to synthetic identity fraud  indicating the vital importance of improving security measures.The growing adoption of biometrics as a security measure has reduced our reliance on passwords. For many people, its made life easier  theres less pressure to remember umpteen different passwords, knowing that your face or your fingerprint is enough to sign into your mobile banking or social media.However, generative AI has made it easier for fraudsters to bypass these mechanisms through deepfaking (images, audio or video that are edited or generated with AI, depicting real or non-existent people).When combined with other identifying factors  such as an individuals national insurance number or first line of address  deepfakes are increasingly finding gaps in finance institutions security measures, giving fraudsters access to bank accounts and much more.As well as helping scammers impersonate banking customers to gain access to their accounts, generative AI is also helping target customers by impersonating customer service representatives. In days gone by, spotting fraudulent text messages or emails was typically easier  they might have spelling mistakes or grammar issues, or be written in a tone of voice that was not aligned with your bank.Now that scammers are using generative AI chatbots, however, generating an email that sounds exactly like your bank is far easier  they can match the corporate email tone with ease and will never make a spelling mistake.This side of financial fraud extends far beyond just emails, too  there have also been a number of instances of scammers creating entire fake websites using AI-generated content and designing the pages to mimic that of a trustworthy bank.Thankfully, just as fraudsters are using AI to commit fraud, banking and finance institutions are using machine learning to detect fraudulent activity  and getting progressively better at doing so. HSBC, for example, partnered with Google in 2021 to develop an AI system for detecting financial crime.Their Dynamic Risk Assessment system is becoming increasingly accurate; initially, false positives were common, but these reduced by 60% between 2021 and 2024. The more accurate these systems become, the better chance we have of eliminating financial fraud altogether.Generally, banks are doing a good job of shoring up their biometric systems against deepfaking  the more scammers they detect via their own machine-learning algorithms, the quicker theyll be able to identify them.Its not just about combatting fraud at an institutional level, however. Part of ensuring that fraud doesnt take place in the first place is about education  teaching banks customers to spot new and developing scams to avoid being caught out.With AI and other technological advances changing the fraud landscape on an almost daily basis, however, this can be challenging. If individuals receive communications from their bank via email, phone call or any other method, they need to interrogate what theyre actually being asked to do. Most banks will never ask you for specific details, so people need to make sure they are clued up at all times.Stuart Wilkie, Head of Commercial Finance at Anglo Scottish Explainer: what is wholesale financingAI Opportunities Action Plan: what can we learn from financial services?\"AI versus finance: the battle against fraud escalates\" was originally created and published by Leasing Life, a GlobalData owned brand.

And not in a good way.Here are some of the worst pieces of financial advice Ive come across on my feeds  plus a few tips for avoiding bad money advice on social media.Read more: Check kiting goes viral on social media. Is it bank fraud?This embedded content is not available in your region.Theres a good chance youve come across ads for payday loans on social media promising fast cash with no credit check. According to the Better Business Bureau (BBB), these ads often target younger users who may not understand the risks involved.Sometimes referred to as a cash advance, payday loans are short-term loans, usually for around $500 or less, that must be paid back within a few weeks. You might opt for a payday loan if youre stuck in a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and need to cover an emergency expense.The downside: Payday loan providers charge exorbitant fees and sky-high interest rates. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, payday loan fees can equate to an APR as high as 662% in certain states.Although a payday loan can seem like a quick fix to a cash flow crunch, these short-term, high-interest loans lead to a vicious cycle of borrowing to stay afloat.A better option: Ask your service providers if theyre willing to offer a payment extension or a more flexible repayment plan. Credit cards offering interest-free introductory periods can also provide a short-term solution with a bit more flexibility than a payday loan.For a longer-term solution, prioritize building up an emergency fund to cover your expenses in a pinch.Watch: 3 ways to avoid living paycheck to paycheckHomeownership is often touted as one of the best ways to build long-term wealth  and it is. However, owning a home comes with many costs and challenges, and it isnt for everyone.Yet some TikTokers claim that renting a place to live is essentially throwing money away and urge viewers to jump on the property ladder as soon as possible.While this may be a viable option for some, saving up enough money for a down payment on a home can take time. As of June 2024, the median down payment on a house in the U.S. was $67,500, according to real estate company Redfin.If youre not in a position to purchase a home, renting can buy you the time you need to save funds for a down payment and move-in costs. It can also give you some time to pay down debt and improve your credit score in order to secure a more favorable interest rate on a home.Luckily, there are a few ways you can save on rental costs as you prepare to become a homeowner, such as signing a longer lease, negotiating your rent with your landlord, or splitting your monthly rent with roommates. And if youre not interested in buying a home at all, thats OK too.Read more: Can you save for a down payment and emergency fund at the same time?Credit cards often get a bad rap for leading to unmanageable, high-interest debt. Thats definitely the case for some people, but it doesnt have to be for you. Credit cards can be a useful tool for building your credit score, financing larger purchases, and earning valuable rewards.The key is to manage your credit card responsibly and strategically. You can put safeguards in place to keep credit card spending in check, such as setting account balance alerts, keeping your credit utilization low, and only charging what you can afford to pay off in full each month.Of course, if you know you struggle with overspending or already have high-interest debt youre working to pay off, a credit card may not be the best choice.Read more: Strategies to pay down mounting credit card debtCertain finfluencers on social media tout bankruptcy as a way to wipe the slate clean if youre struggling with mounting debt. Although bankruptcy can help you start fresh, it also has serious long-term repercussions for your credit and finances.Bankruptcy is a legal process allowing individuals and companies that cant pay their debts to seek relief from some or all of those debts. This may sound like a great idea, but it isnt a decision that should be made lightly. Bankruptcy can also cause a massive drop in your credit score, loss of assets, extra costs in the form of attorney fees, and more.If youre in a bind and cant get a handle on your debt, see if there are ways to rework your budget so you can make extra payments toward your balances and wipe out your debt for good. If not, see if your credit card company or loan provider is willing to work with you on an alternative payment plan. Options such as consolidation, refinancing, or debt settlement could also be viable alternatives with less severe consequences.Read more: Money Basics: What is bankruptcy?For every nugget of wisdom on our social media feeds, theres a plethora of bad advice. Before taking financial pointers from anyone on social media, make sure you do your homework:Vet so-called experts and their credentials: Do some digging to figure out if the person offering you money advice has the background and experience to do so. Are they a certified financial planner or tax professional? Have they worked with clients in similar situations before? What makes them qualified to give you financial advice?Look for shady disclosures: If a social media post promotes a certain financial product, read the fine print to determine if the product is being promoted because its genuinely a good product or because its a paid advertisement.Know when to call in a pro: When in doubt, speaking with a professional debt counselor or financial advisor can help you get the guidance you need to make the most informed decision."

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Consensus Hong Kong chairman Michael Lau (left) with InvestHK head of financial services and fintech King Leung at the InvestHK offices in Central on February 13.

Photo: Matt Haldane>Michael Lau, chairman of Consensus Hong Kong and head of business development at the cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, echoed that sentiment.\"Choosing Hong Kong was a pretty strategic decision, because we know that one of the big themes within the whole space is ... [that] traditional finance has been enabled by this technology,\" Lau said in a joint interview with Leung at the offices of InvestHK on February 13.Consensus Hong Kong is the first major expansion of one of the premier industry conferences since the organiser CoinDesk, a crypto news outlet whose coverage of FTX account irregularities led to the downfall of the crypto exchange, was acquired by Bullish in November 2023.Hong Kong, meanwhile, has been looking to show its continued commitment to growing the virtual asset sector while also illustrating its capacity to host major industry events.One of the hottest topics in the industry right now is stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar and therefore have more traditional finance applications than other cryptocurrencies. Hong Kong is readying stablecoin regulations that will be overseen by the city's de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\"Stablecoins has been one of those places where it was a very great product-market fit when it came out,\" Lau said. \"Because people realised that ... it was a really, really great tool for the ability to do remittances, to do payments in a way that makes it more efficient as well as ... retain more value to the user.\"CoinDesk's new event comes two months after the newsroom was rocked by controversy over the firing of editors, including its editor-in-chief, allegedly for a story about Tron founder Justin Sun. In the article, reporter Callan Quinn struck a tongue-in-cheek tone about Sun's public eating of a banana that was part of the conceptual artwork Comedian, which the crypto entrepreneur bought for US$6.2 million.Fortune reported in December that Bullish dismissed the editors, raising questions of editorial independence and conflicts of interest. Quinn said she resigned after learning of the firings and blamed Tron for undue influence. Tron is a top sponsor of Consensus Hong Kong.\"We have great respect for journalists and the important work media outlets do,\" Tron said when asked for comment. \"Internal matters at CoinDesk are their business, and we cannot speculate or comment on their behalf.\"Bullish did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.Long before the controversy, however, InvestHK - a government group tasked with bringing business to the city - had been in conversation with CoinDesk during their search for a new Consensus event outside North America, according to Leung.\"We have a lot of Web3, crypto natives in Hong Kong who have been attending Consensus for years, so we already have a very strong fan base,\" Leung said.Amid its push to become a global virtual asset hub, Hong Kong has been dealing with seismic shifts in the crypto industry. The re-election of the now crypto-friendly Donald Trump to the US presidency sent the price of bitcoin to a record high.Lau noted that Consensus Hong Kong is the first major industry event since Trump's inauguration on January 20. While he did not give specific numbers for registered attendees, he said more than 100 countries are represented and the large influx of people reflects how moves in the US have increased interest in this space.\"The fact that you have a widening base of different governments showing public support and more regulators providing clarity, all of those things are quite positive,\" Lau said. \"[Sentiment] has certainly shifted because all of a sudden it's accelerating - the excitement around this, the adoption around this.\"Crypto adoption has long been higher in Asia than in other parts of the world, which some have attributed to factors including a large underbanked population. Citing data from a CoinDesk survey last year, Lau said crypto adoption in Asia is at 22 per cent, nearly three times the global average of 7.8 per cent.Hong Kong, once home to leading crypto companies such as Crypto.com and FTX, lost its edge when it signalled regulatory tightening in 2020. While it has been trying to reverse course through greater regulatory clarity since 2022, there is greater competition now from other regional players, especially Singapore.However, Lau and Leung say that Hong Kong has no competition when it comes to liquidity and capital markets, pointing to the much larger market for initial public offerings.\"Anything related to innovation, related to capital markets, then Hong Kong has to be the natural choice,\" Leung said.Lau himself has a strong connection to Hong Kong. He has been based in the city for 16 years, even as New York-based Bullish established its regional headquarters in Singapore. But while Lau said he is happy to see Consensus come to his home city, he insisted the real reason behind the location choice was all business.\"There are very few places in the world where you could do something like this,\" he said. \"Where you have the vision of what we want to bring, the environment that supports it, as well as the infrastructure to be able to execute it.\"This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "The most appealing aspect of artificial intelligence (AI) to consumers in the insurance sector is the potential for which it can speed up service, according to a new report.GlobalDatas Artificial Intelligence in Insurance report in part outlines the results of the companys 2024 Emerging Trends Insurance Consumer Survey, which was conducted across 11 countries and had a total of 5,520 respondents. It outlines that consumers indicated the speed at which they could contact insurers and resolve issues to be the most compelling potential use of AI for them within the sector.The clear most popular response to which AI feature would be most useful was 24/7 availability, with nearly half of the respondents selecting it  but all of the top responses revolved around hearing back from insurers quickly, the report states. The least-selected option was that consumers would prefer insurers did not use AI at all  which suggests the vast majority of insurance customers do believe that it has a place.Among the top responses the question What AI-based feature would be most useful to you from insurers?, 48.7% of respondents indicated 24/7 availability, 38.2% instant responses, 37.8% faster claims processes, 34.2% efficient and 30.3% faster application processes.The report acknowledges that the use of is AI still at a relatively early stage within the insurance industry and that consumers and companies are still getting to grips with it. It notes, however, the survey as having found that a large proportion of insurance customers around the world are open to trying it across various sections of the insurance value chain.The survey also revealed that younger consumers are much more open to trying the technology and need less convincing to do so. Only 6.9% of respondents in that age bracket indicated that they would prefer if consumers didnt use AI for customer service compared to 16.9% across all age groups.This, combined with the expected improvement with AI technology, and importantly how insurers incorporate it, suggests that AI has a very significant role to play in the insurance industry over the next decade, the report says.\"AI appeal in insurance mainly about the speed of service to consumers\" was originally created and published by Life Insurance International, a GlobalData owned brand.

It's more important than ever to ensure you're earning the highest rate possible on your savings, and a high-yield savings account could be the solution.These accounts pay more interest than the typical savings account  as much as 4% APY and higher in some cases. Not sure where to find the best savings interest rates today? Read on to find out which banks have the best offers.In general, high-yield savings accounts offer better interest rates than traditional savings accounts. Still, rates vary widely across financial institutions. Thats why its important to shop around and compare rates before opening an account.As of February 17, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.50% APY. This rate is offered by Jenius Bank and there is no minimum opening deposit required.Read our full review of Jenius BankAs you'll see, the majority of top savings rates come from online banks. These institutions have much lower overhead costs than traditional banks, so they can pass those savings on to customers in the form of higher rates and lower fees.Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:This embedded content is not available in your region.Related: 10 best high-yield savings accounts today>>A high-yield savings account can be a good fit if youre looking for a secure place to store your money and earn a competitive interest rate while maintaining liquidity. Traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) have some of the highest interest rates weve seen in more than a decade, thanks to recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Even so, the national average for these rates is fairly low compared to the top offers available.For example, the average savings account rate is just 0.41%, while 1-year CDs pay 1.82%, on average, according to the FDIC. The Fed is also expected to lower its target rate again in 2025, which means now might be the last chance for savers to take advantage of todays high rates.Taking the time to compare accounts and rates from various financial institutions will help you secure the best deal available. However, interest rates arent the only factor to consider when choosing a savings account.For example, some banks may require that you maintain a minimum balance to earn the highest advertised rate and avoid monthly fees. Other factors to evaluate include customer service options and hours, ATM and branch access, digital banking tools, and the overall financial stability of the institution. Additionally, before opening a savings account, be sure that its insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) if its held by a credit union  so your money is protected in case the institution fails.Read more: How to open a savings account: A step-by-step guideThis embedded content is not available in your region."

Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.Todays average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.53%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.If you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.53% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,902, and youd pay $384,766 in interest over the life of your loan  on top of that original $300,000.The average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.87% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because youll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and thats 15 fewer years for interest to compound.However, because youre squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time, your monthly payments will be higher.If you get that same $300,000 mortgage but with a 15-year term and a 5.87% rate, your monthly payment would jump up to $2,511  but youd only pay $151,899 in interest over the years.Dig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.With an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends  that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.ARM rates have also been higher than fixed rates lately. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.Mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.You can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option  for example, maybe you get a 6% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4% for year one, increase to 5% for year two, then settle in at 6% for the remainder of your term.Just consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself whether youll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.Here are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.53%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.87%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.84%.A normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.53%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.While mortgage rates could inch down here and there, they will probably not significantly decrease by the beginning of 2025."

        "content": "Money market accounts (MMAs) can be a great place to store your cash if you're looking for a relatively high interest rate along with liquidity and flexibility.Unlike traditional savings accounts, MMAs typically offer better returns, and they may also provide check-writing privileges and debit card access. This makes these accounts ideal for holding long-term savings that you want to grow over time, but can still access when needed for certain purchases or bills.Even though rates have been falling over the past several months, it's still possible to find money market accounts that pay more than 4% APY.Here is a look at some of today's best money market account rates:Interested in earning the best possible interest rate on your savings balance? Here is a look at some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.This embedded content is not available in your region.Money market account rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years, largely due to changes in the Federal Reserve's target interest rate.In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, for example, interest rates were kept extremely low to stimulate the economy. The Fed slashed the federal funds rate to near zero, which led to very low MMA rates. During this time, money market account rates were typically around 0.10% to 0.50%, with many accounts offering rates on the lower end of that range.Eventually, the Fed began raising interest rates gradually as the economy improved. This led to higher yields on savings products, including MMAs. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a brief but sharp recession, and the Fed once again cut its benchmark rate to near zero to combat the economic fallout. This resulted in a sharp decline in MMA rates.But starting in 2022, the Fed embarked on a series of aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation. This led to historically high deposit rates across the board. By late 2023, money market account rates had risen substantially, with many accounts offering 4.00% or higher. However, the Fed finally began cutting rates in late 2024.As of 2025, MMA rates remain high by historical standards, though they've begun a downward trajectory following the Fed's most recent rate cuts. Today, online banks and credit unions tend to offer the highest rates.When comparing money market accounts, it's important to look beyond just the interest rate. Other factors, such as minimum balance requirements, fees, and withdrawal limits, can impact the total value you get from the account.For example, it's common for money market accounts to require a large minimum balance in order to earn the highest advertised rate  as much as $5,000 or more in some cases. Other accounts may charge monthly maintenance fees that can eat into your interest earnings.However, there are several MMAs available that offer competitive rates without any balance requirements, fees, or other restrictions. That's why it's important to shop around and compare accounts before making a decision.Additionally, ensure that the account you choose is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per institution, per depositor. Most money market accounts are federally insured, but it's important to double-check in the rare case the financial insitution fails.Read more: Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Which is best for you?The national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.64%, according to the FDIC. However, the best money market account rates often pay around 4% to 4.75% APY  similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts.The amount you will earn on $50,000 in a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY) and the time period you leave the money in the account. For example, if you deposit $50,000 into a money market account that pays 4.5% APY and left it in your account for one year, you'd earn $2,303 in interest.There are currently no money market accounts that pay 5% APY. However, some high-yield savings accounts from online banks do. You can also check with your local bank or credit union to find out if they offer a 5% APY account that fits your needs.This embedded content is not available in your region."

Here are some tips for finding the best CD rates and accounts that match your needs:Shop around: Its a good idea to evaluate CD rates from a variety of financial institutions and compare your options before settling on an account. You can easily compare CD rates online.Consider online banks: Online banks tend to have lower overhead costs, which allows them to offer higher interest rates on CDs. In fact, online banks often have the most competitive rates available.Check minimum deposit requirements: Higher CD rates might come with higher minimum deposit requirements, so make sure the amount you plan to deposit aligns with the requirements to get the best rate.Review account terms and conditions: Beyond the CDs rate, look at terms for early withdrawal penalties and auto-renewal policies. Some CDs offer better terms for flexibility, such as no-penalty CDs, which allow you to withdraw your funds without a fee before the maturity date."

        "content": "By Summer ZhenHONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong government has responded for the first time to questions about the use of cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth for an immigration scheme after a local accountant talked publicly about two cases that had accepted the digital assets.Clement Siu, a Hong Kong-based certified public accountant, told media he had handled two cases where bitcoin and ether were used as proof of clients' assets.Cryptocurriences are not approved assets for direct investment under the immigration scheme, but Siu's cases suggested they can be used as proof of a potential immigrant's wealth, underscoring their growing recognition as a mainstream asset.Hong Kong's investment promotion department, InvestHK, which handles applications for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES), said there were \"no specific requirements\" around asset classes when asked if cryptocurrencies were acceptable assets.Hong Kong relaunched an investment immigration scheme in March 2024 to attract capital. Applicants must show they control assets worth at least HK$30 million ($3.9 million), and then invest that in some approved assets in order to obtain residency.\"InvestHK has never said whether crypto assets are acceptable or not, but they encouraged us to give it a try, so we just tried,\" Siu, a deputy managing partner at Global Vision CPA Limited, which issues accountant reports for immigration applicants, told Reuters.InvestHK did not comment specifically on the cases Siu highlighted and did not say how many immigration applications had been accepted using cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth.Hong Kong is competing against regional rivals such as Singapore and Dubai to become the global hub for virtual assets.\"Accepting virtual assets as proof of assets shows that virtual assets have the same status as traditional assets in Hong Kong, this is an important step in promoting the mainstreaming of virtual assets,\" said Jupiter Zheng, a partner at HashKey Capital.Hong Kong's investment immigration scheme is not open to mainland Chinese, but they can circumvent this restriction if they obtain permanent residence in a third country, analysts say. That could raise concerns about potential evasion of China's capital controls.Siu said one of his clients who used ether as proof of wealth was a Chinese national holding Guinea-Bissau residency.Hong Kong government data for June showed that nearly 80% of more than 250 New CIES applicants were from Guinea-Bissau or Vanuatu.($1=7.78 Hong Kong dollars)(Reporting by Summer Zhen: Editing by Neil Fullick)"

        "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP)  Germany hasn't seen significant economic growth in five years. It's a stunning turnaround for Europe's biggest economy, which for much of this century had expanded exports and dominated world trade in engineered products like industrial machinery and luxury cars.So what happened?Here are five reasons for Germany's ongoing economic slump:Energy shock from RussiaMoscow's decision to cut off natural gas supplies to Germany in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine dealt a severe blow. For years, Germanys business model was based on cheap energy fueling production of industrial goods for export.In 2011, then-Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to hasten the end of nuclear power use in Germany while relying on gas from Russia to bridge the gap as the country moved away from coal generation and toward renewable energy. Russia was then considered to be a reliable energy partner; warnings to the contrary from Poland and the United States were dismissed.When Russia discontinued the flow, prices in Germany skyrocketed for gas and for electricity generated from gas, both key costs for energy-intensive industries such as steel, fertilizer, chemicals and glass. Germany had to turn to liquefied natural gas, or LNG, super-cooled and imported by ship from Qatar and the U.S. LNG costs more than pipeline gas.Electricity now costs industrial users in Germany an average of 20.3 euro cents per kilowatt hour, according to a study the research firm Prognos AG prepared for the Bavarian Industry Association. In the U.S. and China, where many competitors of German companies are located, the cost is the equivalent of 8.4 euro cents.Renewable sources of energy haven't scaled up fast enough to fill the gap. Homeowner and regional resistance to turbines slowed wind energy growth. Infrastructure to transport hydrogen as a replacement fuel for steel furnaces remains mostly on the drawing board.China: From customer to competitorFor years, Germany benefited from China's entry into the global economy - even as other developed countries lost jobs to China. German companies found a massive new market for industrial machinery, chemicals and vehicles. Through the early and mid 2010s, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW reaped fat profits selling into what became the world's largest car market.At the time, Chinese companies produced items like furniture and consumer electronics that didn't compete with Germany's core strengths. Then, manufacturers in China started making the same things that Germans did.State-subsidized Chinese solar panels wiped out Germany's makers. In 2010, Chinese panel makers depended on imported German equipment; today, global solar panel production relies on equipment from China. The government in Beijing has ramped up efforts to promote and subsidize manufacturing for export. The resulting goods  steel, machinery, solar panels, electric vehicles and EV batteries  now compete with German goods on export markets.Germany, the most auto-centric of the European Union economies, had the most to lose from China's export-oriented industrial policy. In 2020, China was not a net exporter of vehicles; by 2024, it was exporting 5 million a year. Germany's net exports fell by half over the same period, to 1.2 million cars. Chinese factory capacity is estimated at 50 million vehicles a year, roughly half of global demand.Skimping on investmentGermany grew complacent during the good times and put off investing in long-term projects such as rail lines and high-speed internet. The government balanced its budget and sometimes ran surpluses off the tax revenue from a booming economy.These days, German commuters shake their heads at trains that don't run on time and constant service disruptions while repairs are made to worn-out tracks. High speed internet hasn't yet reached some rural areas. A transmission line to bring electricity from Germany's windy north to factories in the south has run years behind and won't be ready before 2028. A key bridge on the highway connecting the industrial Ruhr region with southern Germany had to be closed in 2021, 10 years after doubts about its durability emerged. A replacement won't be ready before 2027.A 2009 constitutional amendment handcuffed the government by limiting deficit spending. Whether to loosen the so-called debt brake will be a thorny issue for the German government installed after the country's Feb. 23 election.Lack of skilled workersGerman companies are having trouble finding workers with the right skills, from highly trained IT workers to daycare providers, senior care workers and hotel staff members. In a German Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey of 23,000 firms, 43% of companies said they couldn't fill open positions. The response rose to 58% for companies with more than 1,000 workers.Fewer German students are interested in STEM fields, meaning science, technology, engineering and mathematics. An aging population compounds the problem, as does a shortage of affordable child care that keeps many women working part-time or not at all. Bureaucratic hurdles pose an obstacle to employing high-skill immigrants, though a law passed in 2020 and strengthened in 2023 aims to ease the process.BureaucracyLengthy approval procedures and too much paperwork are a drag on the economy, according to Germany companies and economists. Securing a construction permit for a wind turbine can take years. A few other examples, among dozens raised by German business groups: Companies installing solar panels need to register with both government regulators and their local utility even though the utility could pass on the information to the government level. Restaurants have to log refrigerator temperatures by hand and keep hard copies of the records for a month even if the data has been stored digitally. A law requiring companies to certify that their suppliers are obeying environmental and labor standards went beyond EU requirements, putting a heavier burden on German companies than their European competitors."

        "content": "By Leika KiharaTOKYO (Reuters) - Hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan and sticky inflation are lifting bond yields to multi-year highs and pushing forward rate hike expectations, shaking long-held views that rates would not rise much in the historically deflation-prone economy.Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities said on Monday it now expects the BOJ to raise interest rates to 0.75% in July from 0.5% currently, instead of in October-December.It also pushed forward the timing of a subsequent hike to 1.0% to January 2026 from the final quarter of that year, pointing to growing signs that price pressures will persist.Former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago sees the chance of a hike at the April 30-May 1 meeting, given the BOJ's rising attention to the risk of an inflation overshoot.\"The BOJ's next rate hike could come unexpectedly soon. Markets are probably starting to price that in,\" he said on recent rises in Japanese bond yields.Japanese government bond yields have risen as markets rethink their view that the BOJ won't push up rates beyond 1% - the lower end of its staff estimate that puts Japan's nominal neutral rate in a range of 1% to 2.5%.The benchmark 10-year yield rose 2.5 basis points to 1.375% on Monday, hitting the highest level since 2010. The five-year yield also rose 3.5 points to 1.040%, a level unseen since 2008.Japan's solid October-December GDP data on Monday, coupled with recent strong inflation, have pushed up the yen and bond yields by cementing expectations of a near-term rate hike.BOJ board member Hajime Takata's speech and news conference on Wednesday will be scrutinised by markets for clues on the timing and pace of further rate hikes.The BOJ raised short-term rates to 0.5% in January and signaled its readiness to hike further on the view the economy was progressing towards durably hitting its 2% inflation target.In a quarterly report issued on January 24, the BOJ included analyses on how chronic labour shortages are leading to growing wage-driven inflation - building the case for more rate hikes.A week later, BOJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino said it was \"not normal\" for Japan's real interest rates to remain negative for too long. Board member Naoki Tamura also said earlier this month the BOJ must raise rates to at least 1% by early 2026.The hawkish BOJ signals have led markets to price in a roughly 80% chance of a rate hike to 0.75% in July. A private sector survey showed most economists projecting the next hike to come in the latter half of this year.Former BOJ board member Makoto Sakurai, who retains close contact with incumbent policymakers, expects the BOJ to raise rates to at least 1.5% in the next two years.The International Monetary Fund sees Japan's neutral rate, the level at which policy neither slows nor fuels growth, to be in a band of 1% to 2% with a mid-point of 1.5%, and predicts the BOJ to hike rates around that level by the end of 2027.Some analysts see U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on fixing trade imbalances as working in favour of BOJ rate hikes by watering down the Japanese government's historic resistance to a stronger yen and, by association, higher rates.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday Washington would look at whether countries are engaging in currency manipulation, in setting plans for reciprocal tariffs.\"The Japanese government is mindful of the political risk of being seen (by Washington) as leaving the weak yen unattended,\" said Naomi Muguruma, chief bond strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes)"

        "content": "Might the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, ever get on board with investing in an asset like Bitcoin, (CRYPTO: BTC) which -- on the surface -- breaks all of his traditional rules for investing?It's more reasonable than it sounds. Here's why.Buffett's disposition toward Bitcoin over the years, and also toward cryptocurrencies in general, has been one of unrestrained revulsion. He's called it \"rat poison,\" and said that he wouldn't buy all the Bitcoin in the world, even for a rock-bottom price of $25, because \"it isn't going to do anything.\" He sees all crypto investments as being on track for catastrophe, a view his longtime friend and investing partner Charlie Munger seemed to share.So he probably won't be buying it right now -- or ever. But if he did, he'd probably opt to hold it forever, much like he prefers to do with most of his investments, seeking to accrue an asset's compounding value over time. Bitcoin is a good asset for holding forever -- and therein lies the reason that Buffett is missing out on a great investment, despite it having a lot of qualities that he usually says he likes.Thanks to Bitcoin's halving schedule, which is the rough timeline for when the difficulty of mining it increases relative to the reward produced, it has a built-in slowing supply growth. There can only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, ever, as a result of the hard limits encoded into its protocol (about 19.8 million already are in circulation). So, even if there is a constant level of demand for the coin, given the constraint on supply, its price will rise over time.Let's think about the implications of that a bit more closely to address one of Buffett's key criticisms, which is that he'd need to find someone to sell Bitcoin to at a higher price than the one at which he purchased it.Remember, Buffett said he wouldn't buy all the Bitcoin in the world for $25. But he'll never get that opportunity.There's a legion of Bitcoin fanatics out there who would be backing up the truck to buy it at prices much, much higher than that. One of them is Michael Saylor, the founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy. His company just purchased $742 million in Bitcoin on Feb. 10, giving it a hoard of coins that's now close to $32 billion.Saylor isn't the only Bitcoin evangelist willing to make billions in purchases. Nor are all of the coin's boosters as well-funded. The larger point here is that Buffett's concern that there won't be anyone willing to buy the coin if he were to buy it is simply untrue.It doesn't really matter if Bitcoin, as Buffett said, \"isn't going to do anything\" -- it's become an accepted store of value that can be transferred at a price from one holder to another. The social consensus, as resistant to traditional value investing valuation methods as it may be, is that it's a brand with a lot of value. That's exactly the kind of economic moat Buffett seeks as part of his quest to identify companies with a competitive advantage. And there are only going to be more holders of the coin over time, now that it's established, so the long-term picture is even better than what the halvings alone might imply.There's no chance that Buffett will find the arguments presented above to be persuasive. There's also no way to push back against his implied resistance to buying an asset that he isn't comfortable with determining the intrinsic value of. If you'd made your career on crafting careful valuations and buying assets you knew to be cheaper than their real value, you'd be the same way. But that doesn't mean that you need to follow his lead here.Buying Bitcoin is a great way to build some inflation resistance into your portfolio. It can't simply be printed by any actor, so its value in terms of purchasing power should hold up nicely. Plus, if you're willing to hold on to it for a very long time, you'll likely see its price increase significantly as well.If you're feeling a Buffett-like concern that the coin's price is elevated right now, have no fear. You'll only need to exercise a bit of Buffett's legendary patience and wait calmly for the price to fall back down to a level that's more appealing to you, which could easily happen within the next few years.Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Money markets are back to fully pricing in a first Fed reduction by September. The S&P 500 hovered near its all-time highs. The dollar hit a fresh low for 2025.US retail sales slumped in January by the most in nearly two years, indicating an abrupt pullback by consumers after a spending spree in the closing months of 2024. The value of retail purchases, not adjusted for inflation, decreased 0.9% after an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December.The consumer sentiment report showed people were getting nervous and todays weak retail sales number confirmed it, said David Russell at TradeStation. However, the resulting slack is good news for the Fed and tilts the balance a little bit more toward rate cuts.At Interactive Brokers, Jose Torres says the weak consumption report is reopening the door to a potential Fed reduction this summer, a prospect that was dampened by a piping hot inflation print earlier this week.The S&P 500 was little changed. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%. US markets will be closed Monday for Presidents Day. Meta Platforms Inc. rose for a 20th consecutive session. Dell Technologies Inc. jumped on news its near an over $5 billion server deal for Elon Musks xAI. Intel Corp. fell Friday, but closed with its best week since 2000.The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined five basis points to 4.48%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.3%.Consumers pulled back hard on spending after a generous holiday season, but they were still willing to open their pocketbooks when it came to dining out, said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. This suggests households remain confident in the economy even as policy uncertainty has risen.To Gary Schlossberg at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, evidence of slowing activity isnt enough to offset recent signs of firming inflation and shift expectations back to an early rate cut by the Fed.Are consumers taking a break? said Bret Kenwell at eToro. Investors should be careful not to extract too much meaning from one data point. However, weaker retail sales amid increasing or stubbornly high inflation is a burden for US consumers and companies. Its too early to call it a trend, but if that trend were to develop, it would be a troubling sign.Will Compernolle at FHN Financial says hes skeptical the report signals a true inflection point in consumer spending. Paired with an overzealous reaction to Thursdays producer price index, bonds have moved into overbought territory, he said.The positive scenario from todays data is this: rates ease as the economy moderates and the consumer weakness is a blip that doesnt impact investors love affair with stocks, said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. The flipside is a much worse scenario: the consumer and the government both slam their wallets shut, impacting GDP faster than the Fed is willing or able to operate.Faster inflation in the US could end up being a blessing in disguise for financial markets because it will force President Donald Trump to opt for smaller trade tariffs, according to Bank of America Corps Michael Hartnett.The strategist recommended buying bonds, saying that the 30-year Treasury yield likely reached a multi-year high of about 5% in January. The yield was trading near 4.7% on Friday. Hartnett also reiterated his preference for international equities over US stocks.Bond yields have certainly bounced around this week, and the fact that theyve been able to come back down played a big role in yesterdays strong rally in the stock market, said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak. However, this seemed to have more to do with the inflation issue than with the war or with tariffs.Given that the stock market has been range-bound for almost three months now, any meaningful upside breakout of this range will be quite positive on a technical basis, Maley concluded.An analysis conducted by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shows that the market has been more micro-driven than average since the start of 2023. During the last six months, 74% of the typical S&P 500 stocks returns have been driven by company-specific rather than macro factors vs. an average of 58% over the past two decades.We expect the current micro-driven environment will persist in 2025, said the Goldman strategists led by David Kostin.Among the factors, they said economic forecasts point to a healthy growth environment this year; continued artificial-intelligence development and adoption should create differentiation across stocks; elevated policy uncertainty also suggests elevated dispersion.Debates over trade, tax, fiscal, and other policies represent potential catalysts for additional return dispersion, they noted. A micro-driven market creates opportunity for active managers.Corporate Highlights:Airbnb Inc. issued an upbeat forecast for the first three months of 2025, citing continued strong demand after a bustling holiday travel season.Applied Materials Inc., the largest US maker of chip-manufacturing equipment, issued a lukewarm revenue forecast for the current period, citing the risk of export controls crimping its business.Coinbase Global Inc. said revenue more than doubled and profit increased more than forecast during last quarters Trump-inspired rally in digital assets.Dell Technologies Inc. is in advanced stages of securing a deal worth more than $5 billion to provide Elon Musks xAI with servers optimized for artificial-intelligence work.DraftKings Inc. reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and raised its sales guidance for the current year.Moderna Inc. recorded a quarterly loss as vaccine sales waned and the company had an unexpected charge for a canceled manufacturing contract.Palo Alto Networks Inc. issued a disappointing earnings outlook for the current quarter, despite rivals including Fortinet Inc. and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. posting strong results.Roku Inc., the streaming-video platform company, reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations.SoundHound AI Inc., Serve Robotics Inc. and Nano-X Imaging Ltd. tumbled after Nvidia Corp. filed a 13F indicating that the chipmaker exited its stakes in the companies.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is considering taking a controlling stake in Intel Corp.s factories at the request of Trump administration officials, a person familiar with the matter said, as the president looks to boost American manufacturing and maintain US leadership in critical technologies.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 was little changed as of 4 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 0.4%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%The MSCI World Index was little changedBloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index rose 0.4%The Russell 2000 Index was little changedCurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.3%The euro rose 0.2% to $1.0491The British pound rose 0.2% to $1.2586The Japanese yen rose 0.3% to 152.32 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 0.7% to $97,156.73Ether rose 2.2% to $2,726.16BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined five basis points to 4.48%Germanys 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 2.43%Britains 10-year yield advanced one basis point to 4.50%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.8% to $70.72 a barrelSpot gold fell 1.5% to $2,884.89 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from John Viljoen, Sagarika Jaisinghani, Margaryta Kirakosian, Julien Ponthus and Divya Patil.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateThe NBA Has Fallen Into an Efficiency TrapJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The strong US economy has left distressed debt investors starved of opportunity but that may be about to change, according to veteran high-yield analyst Marty Fridson.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayThe latest Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers showed banks raising standards by the most in three years when theyre lending to medium-sized and larger companies. Thatll put the squeeze on borrowers already grappling with higher funding costs and global volatility from escalating trade wars.At the margin, a tightening of credit standards puts more companies in serious risk of default, said Fridson, a former strategist at Merrill Lynch whose debt analysis has been studied by Wall Street for decades.Risky borrowers are having to refinance at higher interest rates as cheap Covid-era debt facilities start to expire. Despite the Federal Reserve starting to cut rates in September, borrowing benchmarks such as the 10-year Treasury yield have risen since then, leaving junk-rated firms more vulnerable to a downturn that would hurt their earnings and lead to job cuts, denting the wider economy.Theres a correlation of about 0.7 between lending standards and the level of distress in credit markets, Fridsons data going back to 1997 show. The distress ratio  the proportion of bonds trading at a spread of 1,000 basis points or higher  fell to 3.7% in January, well below the 12.7% historical average, and down from a recent peak of 10.4% in March 2023.Youre not going to see the distress ratio zoom up immediately, but it will go up, said Fridson. When the distress ratio was at a record high of 82% in November 2008, credit availability was at its worst ever, the chief executive officer of Fridson Vision High Yield Strategy said.Of course, the latest Fed survey data may just be a blip  lending standards have been in decline since September 2023 and could loosen up again if banks see beyond trade war volatility and get confident that the US is on a sustainable long-term growth path. Other tailwinds include ample global demand for yield from US issuers and private markets, where theres a lot of dry power available that offers a lifeline to some struggling borrowers.Refinancing CostsBut the biggest move up in lending standards since the fourth quarter of 2022 adds pressure to the weakest companies with nearby debt maturities. For some, refinancing costs are unsustainably high, just as new trade and immigration policy threaten to put pressure on input costs and therefore earnings, making debt markets less predictable.Hear Lotfi Karoui, Goldman Sachs chief credit strategist, discuss hedging strategiesAt the same time, corporate bond spreads remain close to the pre-financial crisis tights they hit last year. The narrow gap between risk premiums on notes of different credit quality highlight the fact that there is much more demand for high-yielding debt than net new supply.The distress ratio staying low for a protracted period is a tinderbox waiting to explode, Phil Brendel, senior credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a recent podcast.The geopolitical situation is extremely volatile and I do think that at some point were going to see some kind of event thats going to cause more havoc than we are anticipating, he said. I think were really wound up.Week In ReviewMorgan Stanley and six other banks sold $4.74 billion of X Holdings Corp. debt, allowing the lenders to finally rid themselves of the bulk of their exposure to the financing they arranged for Elon Musks 2022 purchase of the social-media platform.Loans to X Holdings Corp. that banks had on their books at big discounts just a few months ago are being sold at face value now, underscoring a growing concern for investors: Demand for leveraged loans is so strong that prices are soaring.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is talking to investors to refinance slot machine operator United Gaming LLCs private credit debt.Banks including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley extended an upfront commitment to Clayton Dubilier & Rice last year to finance its purchase of part of Sanofis consumer arm, Opella. Theyre waiting to sell the debt to investors until late March or April, after Opella releases its fourth-quarter results, and face the risk of market changes and macroeconomic surprises affecting their profits.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is among a trio of lenders preparing to sell a 1.05 billion ($1.1 billion) loan for Colosseum Dental Group, the latest company to refinance out of private credit and into the more liquid syndicated debt market.Citigroup Inc. privately placed a portion of the financing that is supporting Lakeview Farms acquisition of Noosa Yoghurt, after struggling to drum up sufficient demand for the debt among a wider group of leveraged loan investors.Snap Inc. plans to offer $700 million of junk bonds to repurchase convertible debt, the social-media company said in a statement on Monday.Rogers Communications Inc. raised $2.8 billion in the US and Canada by selling subordinated notes that mature in 30 years.Julius Baer Group Ltd. is getting ready to sell its first Additional Tier 1 bond with an equity conversion clause, joining the Swiss markets switch away from a structure that drew investors ire when $17 billion of Credit Suisse debt went to zero.On the MoveApollo Global Management Inc. managing director Jamie Caruso is leaving the firm to start his own origination platform.

Heres why that would be disastrous for your 401(k).Moreover, the most recent University of Michigan inflation-expectations report had a glass half-full and half-empty quality to it. Inflation expectations rose overall, but expectations were highly bifurcated depending on the political views of the respondents. In general, Republicans expect zero, or near-zero, inflation, while Democrats expect inflation to surge.The glass-half-full interpretation is that this sentiment survey has become useless, as it just reflects political partisanship. The more ominous glass-half-empty interpretation is that inflation expectations are becoming unanchored to the downside for Republicans and to the upside for Democrats  an unwelcome development for Federal Reserve policymakers.The market also seems to be ignoring the risks of a trade war. When President Trump announced a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariff on China, stock prices fell, recovering when Trump walked back and delayed those tariffs for a month. The market barely budged when Trump announced additional tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. This was in the face of a warning from the CEO of Ford Motor Co. that aluminum and steel tariffs would cause chaos for the auto industry.Read: This is why Trumps tariff plan has upended the car industry  and its not over yetMarket strategist George Pearkes said that markets are really bad at pricing binary outcomes, such as the prospect of a tariff-induced trade war  until it happens. He cited the example of the COVID-19-triggered crash: We had cases in the U.S. in January, the first public death Jan. 9, the genome was sequenced Jan. 10, and markets kept rising until Feb. 19.Similarly, as the chart below illustrates, the stock market didnt react to Trumps trade war in 2017-2018 until it stared the news in the face.The stock market seems to be ignoring other key risks. The U.S. House and Senate cant seem to agree on a budget. Even if Congress were to agree on a bill that extends the tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  an important Trump legislative priority  its passage doesnt inject additional economic stimulus because it represents the status quo. Not known is the extent of spending cuts to pay for the tax cuts, which represents fiscal contraction that poses a headwind to stock prices.As well, Trump threatened that all hell would break loose if Hamas doesnt release all of its hostages by Feb. 15. The presidents belligerent remarks put the Israeli government in a difficult position. Conceivably, the tail risk of an attack on Iran could grow if the Saturday deadline comes and goes without a satisfactory resolution.Not incidentally, markets are approaching a seasonally positive period for the VIX Index, which raises the odds of a volatility spike in the near future.Meanwhile, the SKEW Index, which measures the price of hedging downside tail risk, has risen to elevated levels since the U.S. presidential election last November.

Is this true?My retirement is going to be a disaster: Im 59 and have $45,000 in my 401(k). I earn $72,000. Am I doomed?Hedge funds would seem to be the answer. They specialize in opportunistically moving between various asset classes. In theory, they should easily outperform both stocks and bonds.Unfortunately, the typical hedge funds track record shows otherwise.Last year was a case in point. The traditional balanced portfolio that allocates 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds produced a 14.7% return (assuming the stock portion was invested in a broad U.S. stock market index fund and the bond portion was invested in a total U.S. bond market index fund). Thats nearly double the 7.4% return of the Eurekahedge Asset Weighted Index, which is described by Eurekahedge as its flagship asset weighted index of 1,438 constituent funds. This index, Eurekahedge adds, is designed to provide a representative capital weighted benchmark for the entire global hedge fund industry.The index does represent an average of many funds, some of which did much better than average. But these outliers were not known in advance. We know that because of the performance of the Eurekahedge Fund of Funds Index, which is designed to provide a broad measure of the performance of underlying investment managers who exclusively invest in single manager hedge funds.These funds of hedge funds employ analysts who scrutinize hedge-fund track records in hopes of identifying those that should become superior performers. Yet, as you can see from the chart above, the Eurekahedge Fund of Funds index did only marginally better in 2024 than the Eurekahedge Asset Weighted Index (gaining 9.7% versus 7.4%, respectively), and still significantly lagged behind the 60/40 portfolio. The chart also shows that last year was not an exception. Each of the Eurekahedge indexes lagged behind the 60/40 portfolio over the trailing five- and 10-year periods as well.These results bring to mind the explosive conclusion reached by Richard Ennis, a former editor of the Financial Analysts Journal and co-founder of EnnisKnupp, one of the industrys first investment consultants. In an article published in the Journal of Investing in February 2024, Ennis analyzed the impact of alternative investments, or alts. This category includes all asset classes other than stocks and bonds, such as private equity, private market real estate, [and] hedge funds.After analyzing the performance of endowments and other large institutional investors, Ennis concluded: Alpha [the difference between a portfolios return and its benchmark] appears to respond to the presence of alts as if the latter were kryptonite  the greater the exposure, the harsher the effect on alpha.Hope springs eternal. And for many hedge fund aficionados, that means the promise of artificial intelligence. But this hope rests on shaky ground.Consider the performance of the Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, which is designed to provide a broad measure of the performance of underlying hedge fund managers who utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning theory in their trading processes. This index has done even worse than its two broader Eurekahedge index siblings, producing annualized returns of 1.9%, 3.5% annualized and 5.5% annualized over the past one-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively.Hedge funds are more closely tied to the stock and bond markets than most recognize. We know this because of the correlation coefficient of hedge-fund returns and those of the 60/40 portfolio. The correlation coefficient of monthly returns of the Eurekahedge Asset Weighted Index and the 60/40y portfolio is 74%; with the Eurekahedge Fund of Funds Index, the coefficient is 72%.In presenting these sobering statistics, I am not suggesting that the 60/40 portfolio will necessarily perform well in the coming years. Expected returns for both stocks and bonds are mediocre. My point is that, regardless of how stocks and bonds perform, its unlikely that the typical hedge fund or even fund of hedge funds will do better than a 60/40 portfolio.Mark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

Am I doomed?Robert Laura, founder of the Retirement Coaches Association and author of the new book, Retirement Intelligence, lays out insights, both financial and nonfinancial, that can help you make retirement more satisfying.The first thing no one tells you about retirement is that retirement is empty. Its a manufactured phase of life that doesnt hold or contain anything.You have to fill it with things that are of value and important to you, says Laura, a financial adviser. What I see too often is people sometimes fill retirement with the wrong things.If, for instance, you plan to remodel your kitchen to make it easier for family to come over but your family rarely does, it doesnt necessarily make sense to invest $30,000 or $40,000 in your kitchen, Laura says.People sometimes think stuff will add value to their life, but the stuff doesnt change anything, he explains. You have to be that change.Another thing no one tells you about retirement, is to beware of the dark side. Understanding and managing your mental health should be a much higher priority than a stock-market crash.This is really what got me into the business of retirement coaching. I kept seeing clients who had millions of dollars and who had never run out of money, but they were miserable, Laura says.There are five important parts of retirement: mental, social, physical, spiritual and financial, Laura says. Financial is just 20% of the puzzle. Youve got to get everything else right in addition to getting the money right.Still, a major pullback in the stock market, as we saw briefly in early February after President Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, can be chilling.A stock-market crash is a legitimate fear and obviously making sure youre not destitute or reliant upon others is important, but it shouldnt be the main priority, Laura says.Up and coming subtractions another thing no one tells you about retirement.Although you gain time and freedom when you leave your full-time job to start retirement, you may also lose routine, direction, social connection, mental stimulus and influence.This is why so many people grieve the loss of their career identity in retirement and become unsettled or disoriented, Laura believes.If you dont plan for the subtractions, once you retire, you may start questioning your decision to begin this new stage. Laura has seen this in results of assessments hes done of new retirees.People have to find a way to replace things like work identity and routine, says Laura. From a financial perspective, this is where things can get really expensive. Because as you try to figure out these replacements, you can spend a lot of money joining the country club or buying a boat.Retirees often dont realize that retirement doesnt eliminate work. They need to embrace the job requirements ahead in retirement, Laura writes.Job requirements in retirement?Well, youre responsible for yourself and your relationships. I think its about embracing your responsibilities and then being proactive about them, Laura says.One of his pet peeves is when retirees and near-retirees are advised to retire to something. I felt a pang of guilt because I have often written that when planning for retirement, you need to think more about what you want to retire to and less about what you want to retire from.Laura disagrees. The focus should be on what you want to retire with.One of the most interesting things Ive observed over the last 15 years of doing this is that people think theyre going to be someone new when they retire, says Laura. That suddenly theyre going to step across this line and the heavens are going to open up. Hallelujah! And now theyre this brand new person.Instead of trying to reinvent yourself in retirement, start your reinvention process before you retire.That way, on the first day of retirement, youre not going to say: Im finally ready to go to the gym. Im going to start eating vegan. Im going to visit the kids 10 times this year, even though I havent in the last two years, says Laura. Its much easier to maintain things than it is to start fresh.In other words, before quitting your job, begin doing things that give you meaning and purpose. Then, plan to continue them once you retire, perhaps more frequently or differently.Laura blames the financial services industry for being one reason so many of us havent been told these crucial things about retirement.I think the problem with the financial services industry is theres a hard side and a soft side to retirement. The hard side is the numbers, the soft side is this mushy-gushy stuff, Laura says. We need to wake people up, so theyre better prepared for the transition.Im a wife and mother. Can I secretly change my will and leave everything to my daughter instead of my husband?Your choice of partner is the biggest financial decision youll make: Here are the Moneyists 5 worst dating storiesHe doesnt drink, smoke, party or gamble: My boyfriend, 55, is perfect in many ways, but gets mad if I ask him to contributeWe have no prenuptial agreement: Will my wife be able to take my money if I transfer it to my retirement account?My husband filed for divorce, but did not contribute one penny towards the mortgage.

        "content": "By Polina DevittLONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices have marched into uncharted territory as bulls latch on to economic uncertainty created by U.S. import tariff plans, but behind the prize of hitting a record $3,000 per ounce, some flags of a bear case are also being planted.Bullion has had a storming start to 2025, smashing eight records to rise more than 10% by February 11. That followed its biggest annual gain in 14 years in 2024, on a heady mix of strong central bank purchases, geopolitical uncertainties and monetary policy easing.Gold's appeal as a haven from risk strengthened further as newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump turned to tariffs to aid struggling domestic industry, despite the risk of sparking a trade war.When Trump raised tariffs on steel and aluminium this week, spot gold hit a record $2,942.70 per ounce.\"What we have seen is the change in the motive for safe-haven buying - from being driven by the Middle East uncertainty to the threat and realisation of tariffs,\" said Philip Newman, managing director at consultancy Metals Focus.The scale of last year's growth, which started before the Federal Reserve started easing interest rates, was unexpected, with investors apparently willing to disregard the opportunity cost of holding zero-yielding gold. The market also often de-coupled from other usual headwinds such as a stronger dollar.\"Strikingly, gold was rallying as inflation eased, and it looked as though all of our understanding of how gold prices behaved was being challenged,\" said independent analyst Ross Norman.Gold bulls have been emboldened by concerns that U.S. tariff plans could affect gold supplies to the United States, where Comex gold futures trade.As a result, the premium at which most-active U.S. gold futures trade over the London spot price - historically just a few dollars - saw wild volatility and widened to $40 per ounce just before Trump's inauguration on January 20 and more than $60 during the inauguration week.Market players sought to benefit from a lucrative arbitrage opportunity or to cover their existing Comex positions, with the premium attracting massive deliveries to Comex gold inventories. These have jumped by 18.6 million troy ounces, worth $54 billion, since late November.As bullion market players in London - home to the world's largest over-the-counter gold trading hub - rushed to borrow gold from central banks storing bullion in Bank of England vaults, the waiting time to load gold out of the BoE swelled.Switzerland and Asia-focused hubs saw a jump in supplies to the U.S., and gold lease rates surged both in London and India.ACTIVITY PREDICTED TO FADEBut by Tuesday, the Comex premium had narrowed to $28 per ounce, and even while residuary inflows to Comex gold stocks continue, traders and analysts expect the activity to fade.\"Following a surge of gold imports into New York, it seems likely that the dislocation between New York futures prices and the London OTC market is nearing an end,\" said John Reade, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council.\"As the next few weeks pass, queues getting gold from the Bank of England's vaults should diminish, easing an apparent shortage of liquidity in the London market.\"Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP SA, said that while prices could break out towards $3,200, resolution of physical gold dislocations attributed to tariffs and potential structural changes including reduced risk appetite, reduced participation and reduced liquidity are increasingly bearish.She said her firm's average price forecast for 2025 would remain at $2,750, with no intention to revise forecasts up. \"If anything, the recent structural developments these past months have strengthened the bear case for gold,\" she said.Further pointing to potential easing in the rally once the situation with tariffs becomes clear, jewellery demand has been depressed by high gold prices, with discounts offered in key markets India and China. [GOL/AS]Cartier maker Richemont said in November it was having to be \"extremely cautious\" about passing on soaring gold prices in its pricing of watches and jewellery.Emerging market central banks, according to BofA Securities, are at risk of reducing gold buying if domestic currencies weaken on the U.S. tariffs.Physically backed gold exchange-traded funds, which store bullion for investors, have also been relatively quiet, seeing inflows in Europe-listed funds but outflows in North America in January.From a technical perspective, gold has been in the overbought zone of its relative strength index since the start of February. And gold can meet strong resistance around big milestones like $3,000 - gold faltered just above the $2,000 level several times before a decisive break last year.(Reporting by Polina Devitt; Additional reporting by Ashitha Shivaprasad; Editing by Veronica Brown and Jan Harvey)"

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike DolanTalks to end the Ukraine war have partly cut across the hot U.S. inflation report for world markets, reining in both oil prices and capping aggravated U.S. borrowing rates - while also lifting the euro and European shares.Long-flagged by U.S. President Donald Trump as a priority, Wednesday's news that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on talks to end the war dragged crude oil lower.With Russia still the world's third-largest oil producer, the prospect of some future lifting of sanctions on its crude exports saw U.S. oil prices fall back to $70 per barrel and close to the year's lows - down some 4% from Tuesday's close.Helped by data showing a surprising build in crude stocks last week, that's left year-on-year oil prices down almost 10% - tracking the biggest annual decline in two and a half months.The Ukraine initiative emerged after January's biggest monthly gain in U.S. consumer prices in 17 months had catapulted U.S. Treasury yields higher and all but removed futures pricing for a second Federal Reserve interest rate cut this year.As it stands, barely one additional Fed cut is now priced for 2025 and not before October.Even though market-based U.S. inflation expectations over two years hit their highest since shortly after the Ukraine invasion in 2022, the oil retreat helped drag 10-year yields back down about 6 basis points from three week highs hit after the CPI report. They hovered about 4.6% on Thursday.And with producer price numbers out later today, Fed chair Jerome Powell emphasised on Wednesday that the bad news on CPI would not be taken in isolation and components from the PPI that feed into the Fed's favoured 'personal consumption expenditures' (PCE) inflation gauge would be watched closely.\"You need to know the translation from CPI to PCE, and we get more data on that tomorrow with the Producer Price Index,\" Powell told Congress, adding \"we'll know what the PCE reading is late tomorrow.\"Other Fed officials echoed Powell's broad thrust that the Fed was in no hurry to lower rates again with so many wider uncertainties. Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic said he would not be comfortable resuming rate cuts until there was more clarity.The dollar's reaction to the whole piece has been different than usual, with its main index slipping despite the hawkish Fed view and elevated Treasury yields.That's mainly because the euro got a shot in the arm from the prospect of a Ukraine deal that could boost European sentiment and possibly lift the long-standing energy squeeze in Europe - even with uncertain implications for European security longer term.Euro zone stocks continued to set new record highs Thursday - gaining another 1% even as Wall Street ended in the red yesterday after the inflation jolt and S&P500 futures remained flat before today's bell.Remarkably, given the trends of recent years, the near 10% year-to-date gain in euro stocks in dollar terms is four times that of the S&P500 for 2025 so far.Earnings season updates have helped the broader European equity complex. Nestle jumped 6% on its annual sales growth beat, boosting the food and beverages index by more than 2%.On the Ukraine front, the next big set piece is Friday's international security conference in Munich. And next week's German election is also now top of mind there.Elsewhere, the pound also got a lift from news that Britain's economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in the final quarter of last year - offering some respite from the downbeat economic picture facing finance minister Rachel Reeves.In Asia, Chinese stocks fell back on Thursday as trade war and domestic economic worries offset some of the recent optimism about the tech sector and artificial intelligence developments there.Chinese tech stocks reversed an early rally to multi-year highs and the Hang Seng Tech Index closed down 1%.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:* US January producer price report, weekly jobless claims* New York Federal Reserve issues Q4 2024 Household Debt and Credit Report; European Central Bank board member Piero Cipollone speaks* US corporate earnings: Ameren, Airbnb, Global Payments, PG&E, PPL, Moody's, Duke Energy, Howmet, Molson Coors, American Electric, Applied Materials, GEHealthcare, Baxter, CBRE, DaVita, Dexcom, DTE, Digital Realty, Federal Realty, Motorola, Palo Alto Networks, Republic, Wynn, West Pharmaceuticals, Zoetis etc* U.S. Treasury sells $25 billion of 30-year bonds* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy arrives in Munich ahead of international security conference(By Mike Dolan, editing by Ros Russell; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)"

        "content": "Hong Kong's market watchdog has launched a review of eight brokerages to examine their margin financing practices after witnessing heavy oversubscriptions for some initial public offerings (IPOs).The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) was closely monitoring whether these brokerages were careful with their risk management of margin financing for new stocks, CEO Julia Leung Fung-yee said on Friday. Margin financing refers to loans that brokerages offer clients to buy stocks.\"We will examine the securities firms' policies - whether they are sound, fully consider the customer's repayment ability and set appropriate loan limits to prevent overfinancing,\" she said.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

She said individual investors should be careful in gauging demand for new shares from the oversubscription multiple alone. Photo: May Tse>In November 2023, the SFC sent a circular to licensed companies saying they needed to prudently manage their risks when providing IPO subscription services and financing following changes introduced by the Fast Interface for New Issuance (FINI) platform.The FINI platform allows brokers to prepay for only the maximum number of shares that can be allotted in a public offering, instead of locking in funds for the entire excess amount. Some brokers offer zero-interest margin financing loans to attract customers.The SFC had urged companies to guard against any improper risk-taking activities, such as accepting large subscription orders without collecting sufficient subscription deposits from clients upfront or providing excessive IPO financing to clients.Leung's comments came after the watchdog observed that some IPOs were heavily oversubscribed because of easy margin financing terms offered by brokers since the launch of FINI.She reminded individual investors to be careful about gauging demand for new shares from the oversubscription multiple. The performance of some \"hot\" IPOs on the stock market was not as good as expected, she added.\"The [FINI] mechanism allows brokerage firms to lend large amounts because there is a cap on funds they need to pay [as] real funding costs are not reflected,\" said Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities.The worry was this would distort the perception of the IPO and mislead the public into believing that the new shares would perform well on their debut, causing stock prices to fluctuate further, he added.Last month, Chinese toymaker Bloks Group attracted huge demand from retail investors for its HK$1.6 billion (US$206 million) IPO. Retail investors submitted orders for 6,000 times the shares allocated, making it the second-hottest IPO in the city after publisher Most Kwai Chung attracted 6,289 times of subscription for its IPO in 2018.Retail investors borrowed nearly HK$474 billion through brokerages to bid for Bloks' IPO, according to a Bloomberg report, which cited TradeGo data. Shares of Bloks rose nearly 45 per cent from its IPO price.Other highly subscribed recent IPOs include Hong Kong actor Roger Kwok's Herbs Generation Group, which listed in December, and Chinese lighting devices supplier APT Electronics' offering in November.Herbs Generation's shares dropped nearly 47 per cent after the IPO's retail tranche was oversubscribed 6,083 times. APT's shares rose nearly 21 per cent from the IPO price.Katerine Kou, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Securities Association, welcomed the SFC's move.\"We all hope for clearer guidelines on the margin-financing policies,\" she said. \"The thematic review should hopefully benefit the market as a whole.\"This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan is on course to finish offloading millions of dollars of stocks that it bought from beleaguered banks during the financial crisis two decades ago sooner than scheduled, a development that throws into focus the fate of its considerably larger holdings of exchange-traded funds.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayThe book value of share holdings acquired by the BOJ stood at 52.8 billion ($345 million) as of Feb. 10, according to the latest BOJ report on its account. Considering the pace of its monthly selling has consistently been about 10 billion over the past few years, the central bank could dispose of all the remaining assets in about five months. The bank said in 2015 it would finish selling down these shares by March 2026.Its a key consideration for investors. Many BOJ watchers are of the view that authorities wouldnt likely sell the assets purchased from banks and ETFs simultaneously over concerns of potential market ructions. An early finish to the bank stock operations raises the possibility that the BOJ may telegraph its intention to sell ETFs by kicking off discussions with market participants on the process as early as this year.The ETFs holdings are the last major piece of Governor Kazuo Uedas policy puzzle. As hes sought to unwind the ultraeasy policy settings undertaken by his predecessor, the governor has refrained from referencing specific plans for ETFs even as he raised interest rates and dismantled the yield-curve control mechanism.Ueda has raised rates three times over the last 12 months, and has also announced a plan for quantitative tightening through the sale of massive government debt holdings. The chief last month reiterated his long-held position that he needs more time to mull the fate of the ETFs because its a complicated issue.The BOJ holds about 37 trillion ($242 billion) of ETFs by book value, according to the latest account data. In terms of market value, these assets were worth 70.3 trillion at the end of September, according to a central bank report.The BOJ began to buy the stock funds in December 2010 as part of a monetary stimulus program aimed at stoking inflation. Former Governor Haruhiko Kuroda expanded the asset buying so much that the bank became the biggest single holder of Japanese stocks before his successor Ueda formally ceased the operations in March last year.Compared with the ETFs, the scale of the purchase of banks stock holdings was about 15 times smaller. The BOJ began acquiring those assets in November 2002 and sustained the buying for about two years as it sought to preserve financial system stability by helping banks address their severe bad debt problems. In the wake of the global financial crisis, the bank resumed the buying between February 2009 and April 2010.While the size of the bank shares is relatively small compared with the BOJs ETF holdings, its taken the central bank roughly a decade to get this close to shedding all the stocks from its balance sheet. The bank began to initially sell them in October 2007 before suspending sales a year later due to the global financial crisis. At the end of 2015, it said it would resume the sales in April 2016 with an extension of the selling duration to a decade.The fate of the BOJs ETF holdings has already caught the attention of some politicians as the nation expands fiscal spending even as it already shoulders the largest public debt burden among developed nations. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan has called for shifting ownership of the assets to the government so they can be used to fund childcare measures.Some analysts say that one option would be to replicate what Hong Kong did after its stock market intervention in 1998, when it disposed of its holdings by pooling them into a new listed vehicle. Japan could also create an entity to sell into the market at opportune times, or offer the assets to long-term institutional investors off the market, they said.While interest in the issue is growing, there is little need for the BOJ to rush to dispose of its stock fund assets. The bank earned 1.2 trillion in revenue from ETF dividends in the fiscal year ended in March 2024. That flow of funds is expected to continue offering sizable support for the banks finances at a time when the cost of paying interest to banks is bound to rise further in tandem with its normalization process.The average pace of the BOJs bank stock selling has been 11.1 billion per month since 2021. If the BOJ takes exactly the same approach with its ETF assets, the process would take 279 years.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "President Donald Trump on Sunday said that his administration is investigating the U.S. national debt, suggesting that certain Treasury payments may be fraudulent and \"might not count.\" Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said his administration is reviewing debt records to uncover potential financial mismanagement.The U.S. national debt is approximately $36.2 trillion, exceeding 120% of the country's GDP, according to the U.S. Treasury. Trump indicated that Treasury payments are currently under review.Were even looking at Treasuries, he said. There could be a problemyouve been reading about that. That could be an interesting problem...It could be that a lot of those things dont count. In other words, some of that stuff that were finding is very fraudulent, therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought.Don't Miss:The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement  How do you compare?Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing  you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday that Trump's comments weren't about payments to holders of US debt but possible improper payments to contractors and for grants.This has sparked questions from financial experts since Treasury securities are considered some of the safest investment instruments worldwide.While Trump has suggested that fraudulent payments could be inflating the national debt, independent budget watchdogs argue that the administration's proposed tax cuts would add trillions of dollars in new debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trumps tax plans will add $7.75 trillion to the projected debt through fiscal year 2035.Trending: Scrolling To UBI'  Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.To help crack down on eliminating waste and identify fraudulent spending in the federal government, Trump has enlisted billionaire Elon Musk to lead an overhaul of federal government operations. Musk's newly established Department of Government Efficiency has reportedly been reviewing payroll and spending records, raising privacy and security concerns.A federal judge recently blocked Musks team from accessing and storing data from certain government financial systems, citing the risk of improper disclosure of sensitive information. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Musk's team had only read-only access and could not make changes to the system.Beyond speculative fraudulent payments from the Treasury, Trump also said that foreign countries play a role in the United States' rising debt, blaming countries like Mexico and Canada for taking advantage of the U.S. in trade deals.Were not that rich right now. We owe $36 trillion dollars. Thats because we let all these nations take advantage of us, Trump told Fox News in an interview aired on Sunday.See Also: The average 401(k) balance soars to a record-breaking high  Here's how to know if your nest egg is keeping pace.While Trump tied trade deficits to the national debt, financial experts say the two are separate issues. Trade deficits measure the difference between a countrys imports and exports, whereas the national debt reflects government borrowing over time. Treasury data shows that as of November, Canada and Mexico held $374 billion and $100 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, respectively.Trump's investigation into Treasury payments has sparked debate among economists and lawmakers. While supporters argue that identifying wasteful government spending is crucial, critics warn that questioning the validity of Treasury payments could destabilize global financial markets. With the debt ceiling deadline looming, all eyes are on Congress to determine the future of U.S. fiscal policy.As this situation develops, financial experts emphasize the importance of distinguishing between legitimate debt obligations and potential inefficiencies in government spending. Whether Trump's efforts will yield meaningful reductions in the national debt remains to be seen.Read Next:Many are using retirement income calculators to check if theyre on pace  heres a breakdown on whats behind this formula.Inspired by Uber and Airbnb  Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets  with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share!Up Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Chart of the Week: Outbound Tender Reject Index, Outbound Tender Volume Index  Laredo SONAR: OTRI.LRD, OTVI.LRDShipper requests for truckload capacity are being rejected at the highest rates since the pandemic era in Laredo, Texas  the largest U.S. border crossing market.The Outbound Tender Reject Index (OTRI) measures the percentage of truckload capacity requests that carriers decline. Since rejecting loads is generally undesirable for carriers, rising rejection rates indicate a tightening market with limited available capacity.Rejection rates for loads out of Laredo averaged around 3.8% from October through mid-December but surged over 6% just before Christmas and have unexpectedly remained elevated.Since October, demand has been running approximately 10% higher year over year, yet rejection rates only spiked around the holidays. This suggests that demand alone may not explain the market tightening.One potential driver is uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy. Over the past month, President Donald Trump threatened, implemented and then paused tariffs on Mexico, the U.S.s largest trading partner by value. This uncertainty was anticipated before the election, which may explain the sustained growth in cross-border freight demand as shippers rush to move goods ahead of potential cost increases. However, the rising rejection rates suggest additional factors at play.From an outbound freight perspective, Laredo is a relatively small market. It ranks 48th out of 135 U.S. freight markets, with just 0.7% of total outbound freight volume. Its location  a days drive from Dallas and just over a half-day from Houston  makes it relatively remote.Most notably, Laredo handles far more freight moving out of the region rather than originating there, a trend that has intensified over the past year. When freight markets become heavily outbound-focused, carrier networks can become strained, leading to supply chain inefficiencies.In major outbound-heavy markets like Los Angeles, pricing accounts for the additional cost of repositioning empty trucks (also known as deadheading). Shippers pay beyond the direct transport cost, covering the expenses carriers incur when relocating equipment.However, Laredos cost to serve has risen even as broader freight rates decline. Carriers have struggled to pass along these repositioning costs, reducing their incentive to prioritize Laredo-bound freight.Contract rates in key lanes, such as Laredo to Dallas, have increased 13% year over year, according to SONARs invoice data, while spot rates in this lane have risen 8%. Yet, these increases have not kept enough carriers in the market to prevent rising rejection rates.One major reason: Carrier attention remains focused on California, where import-driven demand has stayed elevated for over a year.The Los Angeles market appears to be absorbing much of the available truckload capacity. Geopolitical concerns and tariffs have pushed Asian imports to near-pandemic levels, further strengthening demand. Unlike Laredo, Los Angeles is a massive freight hub with longer lengths of haul, making it a more attractive market for carriers.Currently, Los Angeles-area freight volumes are up 7%-8% year over year, yet rejection rates remain below 3%, indicating a loose capacity environment. With average hauls exceeding 900 miles and rates rising since last summer, carriers are increasingly prioritizing California over smaller, less lucrative markets like Laredo.Laredo isnt the only market where capacity is starting to show vulnerability; the Chicago market has also seen rejection rates climb and sustain above 7%.The overriding theme that a meaningful amount of capacity has left and continues to leave the domestic truckload market may be the biggest reason for the increases in these market-level rejection rates. Carrier networks are becoming more difficult to manage as there is less buffer when shifts in demand arise.The FreightWaves Chart of the Week is a chart selection from SONAR that provides an interesting data point to describe the state of the freight markets. A chart is chosen from thousands of potential charts on SONAR to help participants visualize the freight market in real time. Each week a Market Expert will post a chart, along with commentary, live on the front page. After that, the Chart of the Week will be archived on FreightWaves.com for future reference.SONAR aggregates data from hundreds of sources, presenting the data in charts and maps and providing commentary on what freight market experts want to know about the industry in real time.The FreightWaves data science and product teams are releasing new datasets each week and enhancing the client experience.To request a SONAR demo, click here.The post Truckload rejection rates surge in largest US-Mexico cross-border market appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "source": "Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A version of this post first appeared on TKer.coAlmost every day, we hear about economic data, financial news, a policy move, a geopolitical event, or some other development that presents a new headwind to the stock market. Rising inflation, higher interest rates, natural disasters, tariffs, war breaking out between our trading partners, viral outbreaks, and so on.Any of these challenges could hurt business activity or reduce an investors appetite to take risk in the stock market.But as history  including recent history  has taught us, its possible for the economy to flourish and the stock market to rise despite emerging headwinds.These counterintuitive outcomes can often be explained by the most important Latin phrase in investing: Ceteris paribus.Ceteris paribus roughly translates to \"all else equal\" or \"other things held constant.\"Its a caveat analysts use when they are examining and discussing the effects of a variable assuming nothing else is changing.For example: Rising oil prices, ceteris paribus, mean lower earnings because of higher energy costs.Ceteris paribus gets you clean and simple explanations.Unfortunately, the world is complicated. And all else is never equal.What if those higher oil prices are the result of stronger demand from a hotter-than-expected economic activity? This could mean revenue for your business is growing faster than planned, which could more than offset your higher energy costs, which in turn means your earnings are higher.This is how Ive been discussing evolving expectations for Fed rate cuts for more than a year. Fewer rate cuts, ceteris paribus, may be considered hawkish for stocks. But these lowered expectations have come amid better-than-expected economic data, which has fueled earnings growth and sent stock prices up and to the right.TKer subscribers have seen this language used frequently when weve quoted analysts addressing emerging challenges (emphasis added):\"In general, we estimate every 10% rise in the USD translates to a 3% hit to EPS, all else equal.\" - BofA, January 2025\"We estimate that each 1 percentage point change in the statutory domestic tax rate would shift S&P 500 EPS by slightly less than 1%, or approximately $2 of 2025 S&P 500 EPS, all else equal.\" - Goldman Sachs, Sept. 2024\"Through the lens of our EPS model a 10% rise in oil would boost S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1%, all else equal.\" - Goldman Sachs, April 2024\"[C]omparing today's valuation to its prior multiples may be more punitive in that today's market is more asset-light, labor-light and debt-light than prior cycles and Corporate America's renewed focus on efficiency argues for a lower equity risk premium all else equal.\" - BofA, October, 2024\"The S&P 500 effective tax rate would need to rise from 20% today to roughly 28% in 20 years to offset the potential earnings boost from AI adoption, all else equal.\" - Goldman Sachs, June 2023\"The impact from a 1% buyback tax is two-fold: 1) reduction in earnings from paying the new tax; 2) reduction in overall gross buybacks (all else equal) to compensate for the tax and thus a smaller reduction in S within EPS.\" - JPMorgan, September 2022To be clear, ceteris paribus also means there could be other negative developments that arent being considered, not just positive ones. Again, the world is complicated.But in recent months and years, ceteris paribus has frequently been a reminder that even though we are witnessing challenges emerge, theres also a lot of things were not talking about that could go right.Ive made this point a couple times. (See here and here.)Notably, see the April 10, 2022 TKer: The wrong question  and the right one  to ask about earnings headwinds. From that newsletter:When a new headwind emerges, investors probably think to themselves: How will this hurt the earnings of the companies Im invested in?... The problem is were asking the wrong question.... The right question is: Can the companies Im invested in deliver on earnings?Its similar to the question above, but it broadens the scope of the inquiry to consider more than just the negative impacts of just the unfavorable developments.Simply put, investors should not be thinking about the effects of some development in isolation. It needs to be considered in the context of everything that affects earnings. Because for investors, what ultimately matters is whether earnings will keep going up.Theres been lots of news about new tariffs and the potential for more tariffs down the road. And tariffs are almost universally considered negative for all of the economies involved.Its a big deal, especially since many companies and analysts have yet to factor in the impact of tariffs into their earnings forecasts.\"We estimate that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico plus 10% incremental tariffs on China translates into a 2% hit to EPS, all else equal (1.7% from Canada & Mexico and 0.3% from China),\" BofAs Savita Subramanian wrote in a Feb. 9 note.As Subramanians use of \"all else equal\" suggests, the situation is more complicated than simply calculating the cost of tariffs when applied to recent trade data. The ultimate effects could be much worse! And were not even addressing all of the other tariffs that have been threatened in recent days.But we also know many companies have actively taken steps to blunt the incremental costs of tariffs and work around potential disruptions to global supply chains.We also know that companies have been reporting earnings that have exceeded expectations.As we assess the effects of tariffs and other challenges that may emerge, we should also be vigilant of the positive things going on that may help keep earnings growing  which in turn would support stock prices going higher.There were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:Shopping ticks lower from record levels. Retail sales declined 0.9% in January to $723.9 billion.Most categories fell during the period.Wildfires in Los Angeles and harsh winter weather in other parts of the country may have disrupted January retail activity.Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: \"As of 07 Feb 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 3.1% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 07 Feb 2025, our estimate of the US Census February control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.48%.\"Inflation ticks up. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in January was up 3.0% from a year ago, up from the 2.9% rate in December. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 3.3%, up from the prior months 3.2% level.On a month-over-month basis, CPI was up 0.5% and core CPI was up 0.4%.Inflation expectations remain cool. From the New York Feds January Survey of Consumer Expectations: \"Median inflation expectations were unchanged at 3.0% at both the one- and three-year-ahead horizons. Median five-year-ahead inflation expectations rose by 0.3 percentage point to 3.0% in January. This increase was driven primarily by respondents with a high-school education or less.\"Powell says Fed isnt in a \"hurry.\" From Fed Chair Jerome Powells semiannual monetary policy report: \"With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too slowly or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\"Gas prices tick up. From AAA: \"Amid the threat of tariffs, the national average for a gallon of gas ticked up two cents from last week to $3.13. According to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gasoline demand increased from 8.30 million b/d last week to 8.32. Total domestic gasoline supply rose from 248.9 million barrels to 251.1, while gasoline production decreased last week, averaging 9.2 million barrels per day.\"Unemployment claims fall. Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 213,000 during the week ending February 8, up from 220,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth.Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.87% from 6.89% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage continued to inch down this week, reaching its lowest level thus far in 2025. Recent mortgage rate stability is benefitting potential buyers, as purchase demand is stronger than this time last year. This is an indication that a thaw in buyer activity could be on the horizon.\"There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million (or 40%) of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.Small business optimism cools after huge spike. From the NFIBs January Small Business Optimism Index report:\"Small business owners greeted the new year with a surge in optimism. Seventeen percent (seasonally adjusted) now view the current period as a good time to expand substantially, up from just 4 percent a few months ago. A seasonally adjusted net 20 percent expect real sales gains compared to a net negative 18 percent a few months earlier. Better business conditions were expected by a seasonally adjusted net 47 percent, up from a net negative 13 percent just four months ago (net of negative responses). Reports of unfilled job openings and plans to hire to fill them remained historically high. Owners have been unsuccessful filling them over the past four years, finding few qualified applicants while government related hiring soared. Tough competition.\"Industrial activity ticks higher. Industrial production activity in January rose 0.5% from the prior month. Manufacturing output declined 0.1%.Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: \"Peak day office occupancy was 63.3% on Tuesday last week, down one tenth of a point from the previous week. Austin saw a 2.7-point increase in Tuesday occupancy, up to 71%, and a 7.5-point increase in Wednesday occupancy, up to 71.9%. The average low was on Friday at 35.8%, down nearly a full point from last week.\"Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Feds GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.3% rate in Q1.The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.Demand for goods and services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded.To be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve  having resolved the inflation crisis  has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investors perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth  in the cooling economy  is translating to robust earnings growth.Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about  such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.Theres also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.For now, theres no reason to believe therell be a challenge that the economy and the markets wont be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and its a streak long-term investors can expect to continue."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Australias central bank is poised to cut interest rates for the first time in four years even as the board remains alert to potential inflationary pressures from mounting global trade turmoil and risks of an election splurge at home.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegHow to Build a Neurodiverse CitySpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayA majority of economists in a Bloomberg News survey as well traders expect the Reserve Bank to finally embark on easing on Tuesday with a 25 basis-point reduction in the cash rate to 4.1%. That would be the RBAs first cut since November 2020 and may provide a shot in the arm for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who needs to overcome poor polling to secure a second term.Money markets are pricing about 85% chance of a cut. Yet a pick up in consumer spending, aided by tax cuts and government subsidies, along with rising uncertainties about the impact of US trade policies may also convince policymakers to stay cautious.The RBAs level of policy restrictiveness remains broadly on par with major counterparts because it didnt tighten as aggressively in 2022-2023. The board had sought to hold onto labor market gains while bringing inflation back to target  a delicate balance that has drawn some criticisms.Below are the arguments for and against a rate cut on Tuesday.Why Cut?Price pressures are receding at a faster pace than the RBA anticipated, according to data. This is likely to be reflected in its quarterly update of macroeconomic forecasts released together with the rate decision. At the same time, the economy has slowed sharply since 2023.If I were still at the RBA, Id struggle to write a board paper justifying rates on hold given how much inflation has come down, given the likely near-term trajectory and given how much the RBA is going to have to revise its forecasts in the new round, said Luci Ellis, chief economist at Westpac Banking Corp. who was an assistant governor at the central bank.Still, the discussion around policy easing is unlikely to be straightforward, with the RBAs statement and Governor Michele Bullocks press conference widely expected to tilt hawkish.Its hard to know how much theyll pivot their language, Ellis said. However, this is not a big cutting cycle. We really think theyve got at most 100 basis points.Economists expect the RBAs latest inflation forecasts to show downward revision to its closely-watched trimmed mean gauge.There are signs of disinflation durability with cooling price pressures in rents, new home purchase costs and insurance, economists at Rabobank pointed out. Consumer inflation expectations as measured by the Melbourne Institute are back to pre-Covid levels and business capacity utilization levels are easing.Why Extend Pause?The case to hold is also strong, and hinges on factors including a recent pick-up in consumer spending underpinned by income tax cuts and government cost-of-living subsidies. These, together with cooling inflation, have boosted household disposable income which has spurred consumption.Westpacs Ellis and her counterpart at Commonwealth Bank of Australia Gareth Aird see at least a 20% probability the RBA stands pat on Tuesday and keep the rate at a 13-year high of 4.35%.The Australian dollar has fallen more than 5% since the US election in November, increasing the cost of imported goods.What Bloomberg Economics Says...Market pricing doesnt capture the risk of a hold  which is still possible. Why the uncertainty? A strong labor market, resilient consumers, robust credit growth and a weaker currency could convince the RBA to delay its pivot.James McIntyre, economist.For full note, click hereMeanwhile, Australias jobless rate stayed low in December while vacancies remain high, suggesting unemployment could fall further and boost compensation.Government wages data is due on Wednesday while the January employment report will be released the day after. Bullock will also get an opportunity to deliver her verdict on the two key sets of data on Friday when she appears before a parliamentary committee for three hours of testimony.There are concerns too that government spending will further increase as Australia heads to a general election due by May 17. Already, state and federal governments are spending heavily, keeping demand elevated and adding to the difficulty of cooling the critical last mile of inflation.The level of rate cut certainty priced into the RBA meeting is too high, said Sean Keane, chief Asia-Pacific strategist for JB Drax Honore. A rate cut might well prove to be the right thing later in the year, but the Australian economy isnt screaming out for it at present and theres little reason to rush.--With assistance from Shinjini Datta.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. A bull put spread is an options strategy where you sell a put option at a higher price and buy one at a lower price for the same asset and expiration date. This helps generate income and limits losses, making it good for traders expecting small price increases or stable prices. The most you can earn is the premium received, and the most you can lose is the difference between the strike prices, minus the premium. Working with a financial advisor can help you adjust this strategy to meet different investment goals and risk levels.A bull put spread is a type of options strategy that traders use when they expect an asset's price to remain stable or rise modestly. It involves selling a put option with a higher strike price while buying another put option with a lower strike price.As noted earlier, both options are on the same asset and have the same expiration date. The premium received from selling the higher strike put helps offset the cost of purchasing the lower strike put, which in turn reduces the overall capital requirement.Put options allow the holder to sell an asset at a set price before the option expires. But, they are not required to do so. Traders who buy put options usually expect the assets price to fall, indicating a bearish outlook. Selling a put option, on the other hand, indicates that the trader is ready to buy the asset at the strike price if necessary.In a bull put spread, the trader profits when the asset's price remains above the higher strike price at expiration, allowing both options to expire worthless and capturing the net premium received. If the price falls below the lower strike, the loss is limited to the difference between strike prices minus the initial premium collected, making it a defined-risk strategy.The strategy is most effective when implied volatility is high because this raises put option premiums, letting traders earn more from selling the higher strike put. Choosing the right strike prices is important for using the bull put spread effectively.An in-the-money (ITM) put option has a strike price higher than the current market price of the asset, meaning it already has intrinsic value. An at-the-money (ATM) put option has a strike price equal to or very close to the asset's current price.Selling an ITM put brings in a higher premium but has a higher risk of having to buy the asset if its price stays below the strike price. Selling an ATM put strikes a balance between earning a good premium and the option expiring without value. Many traders opt to sell an out-of-the-money (OTM) put, setting the strike price below the current price of the asset, which lowers the risk of having to buy the asset while still earning a premium.As the expiration date approaches, traders might close the trade early to secure profits if the value of the spread has dropped significantly. If the price of the asset falls, extending the spread to a later date or changing the strike prices can help reduce potential losses.To see how a bull put strategy plays out, let's assume that a stock is currently trading at $150. A trader expects the stock to stay above $145 over the next month. To set up a bull put spread, the trader would:Sell a $145 put for $4 per contract.Buy a $140 put for $2 per contract.This results in a net credit of $2 per share, equal to $200 per contract.If the stock remains above $145 at expiration, both options expire worthless, and the trader keeps the $200 profit.If the stock falls below $140, the trader takes the maximum loss, calculated as the $5 strike difference minus the $2 credit, totaling $3 per share or $300 per contract.If the stock closes between $140 and $145, the trader experiences a partial loss depending on the put spread's value at expiration.Overall, the bull put spread allows the trader to profit from neutral-to-bullish price action while maintaining a defined risk.One key advantage of using a bull put spread is that it lets a trader profit even if the stock price does not rise significantly. It only has to stay above the short put's strike price at expiration.Additionally, because the trade results in a net credit, time decay works in the trader's favor, meaning the value of the spread naturally declines over time, increasing the likelihood of a profitable exit. The defined risk structure also makes it easier to manage losses when compared with selling naked puts.However, just as it limits potential losses, a bull put spread caps potential profits. These are limited to the value of the net premium received, which may be lower than other bullish strategies like buying calls.Although the risk is capped, theres a chance of early assignment if the short put falls into the money before expiration, particularly for stocks that pay dividends. If implied volatility falls, it can decrease the spread's value, which is good for the seller. But, if volatility rises, the trade could move against the trader. Traders can potentially avoid losses by making adjustments, such as extending the expiration date, though this requires careful management.A bull put spread allows traders to earn income with managed risk, which can be a suitable strategy for moderately bullish markets. This strategy uses two put options at different strike prices to cap losses while taking advantage of time decay and steady prices. While profit and risk are predefined, things like implied volatility and early assignment can affect results. Carefully choosing strike prices and expiration dates could help match the trade to market conditions.A financial advisor can help you manage risk for your portfolio.

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. A buy limit order is a stock market order where investors set a maximum price for buying a security. This method lets investors control their purchase price and avoid paying too much in volatile markets. Unlike market orders that execute at the current best price, buy limit orders only fill if the stocks price reaches or falls below the specified limit, promoting disciplined investing. Working with a financial advisor can help you determine how to use buy limit orders based on different investment strategies.A buy limit order is an instruction placed with a broker to purchase a specific security only if its price falls to or below a predetermined level. This type of stock order is particularly useful for investors who want to avoid overpaying for stocks or other assets.As an example of how this would work, if a stock is currently trading at $50 per share, an investor might set a buy limit order at $45. If the stocks price drops to $45 or lower, the order is executed automatically.This approach is particularly useful for long-term investors, or those who use technical analysis, to identify specific entry points. Buy limit orders allow investors to strategically build their portfolios by setting precise purchase prices, which helps avoid buying at temporarily high prices.A market order is an instruction to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available price. The market order prioritizes speed over price control, making it suitable for investors who need to quickly enter or exit a position. For example, if a stock is trading at $50 per share and an investor places a market order, the trade will execute immediately at the current market price, even if slight fluctuations occur during the transaction.In contrast, a buy limit order focuses on price control by specifying the maximum price an investor is willing to pay. While this approach helps investors avoid overpaying, it introduces the risk that the order may be delayed and even not executed at all if the market price never reaches the specified limit.Market orders are best suited for highly liquid stocks where price differences between the bid and ask are minimal. Buy limit orders, on the other hand, are more appropriate for investors aiming to capitalize on specific price targets or avoid paying too much in volatile or illiquid markets. The choice between these orders depends on the investor's priorities  speed vs. price control  and their overall investment strategy.A stop order, also known as a stop-loss or stop-buy order, triggers a market order once the specified stop price is reached. For example, a stop-buy order is used to purchase a stock only after its price rises to or above the stop level, often signaling upward momentum. This allows investors to buy into a stock after confirming its price is trending higher.A buy limit order, by comparison, is designed to execute only at or below a specific price, focusing on acquiring the stock at a favorable entry point. While buy limit orders aim to secure a lower purchase price, stop orders are typically used to capitalize on momentum or to protect against losses.Using a buy limit order lets you set up trades automatically without needing to constantly monitor the market. You need to choose a realistic limit price based on historical prices, technical indicators, or support levels to help you set up a good entry point.Additionally, you should keep track of transaction costs, which can eat into your profits if orders are too frequent or not well thought out.Buy limit orders can be set as day orders, which expire at the close of the trading session, or good till canceled (GTC) orders, which stay active until they are filled or canceled. However, theres a risk that the order might not execute if the market price doesnt reach your set limit, trading off immediate execution for price control.Adding buy limit orders to your strategy could help you plan your market entries with the goal of managing market volatility.Buy limit orders offer investors a structured and disciplined way to approach the market by allowing them to set specific price thresholds for their trades. This strategy helps maintain control over purchase costs and can align well with long-term goals or targeted investment strategies. Potential uses include capitalizing on price dips and automating trades. By understanding how buy limit orders differ from other order types, such as market and stop orders, investors can choose the approach that best fits their objectives.A financial advisor can help you build a portfolio and manage investments for risk.

        "content": "Some young people are being priced out of the lives they imagined for themselves.Gen Zers are racking up debt and struggling to afford buying a home or having kids.There are still steps young people can take to help achieve their dreams, says an Experian executive.Young people are being priced out of the lives they pictured for themselves. Many Gen Zers, born between 1997 and 2012, are racking up debt and fear \"adult\" milestones such as becoming homeowners and having children are out of reach.\"Generation Z is deeply concerned about the feasibility of achieving the lives they envision,\" Jennifer Rubin, a senior researcher at education research group foundry10, told Business Insider.\"Rising costs of living, tuition fees, and an unstable job market have made milestones like homeownership, financial independence, and even career stability seem more out of reach than ever before.\"Gen Z has a debt problem.As a group, they have roughly 30% more credit card debt than millennials did at their age even after inflation, TransUnion data shows. They're also the most likely cohort to max out credit cards and become delinquent on payments, New York Fed data shows.Alyssa Schaefer, the general manager and chief experience officer of Keybank-owned Laurel Road, a digital banking platform, said uncertainty about repaying student loan debt is \"having long-term implications on young people's financial milestones.\"She cited a survey commissioned by her firm in partnership with Luminary, a professional education and networking platform, and conducted by Kantar this past fall.Of the 1,714 US adults with private or federal student loans surveyed, 79% said they struggled to save for emergencies or retirement, 75% said they couldn't invest, 52% said they couldn't afford to buy a home, and 35% said they were delaying having children. Most respondents were aged 25 to 44, while responses were collected from ages 18 to 65-plus.Owning a home feels painfully out of reach for many young Americans.Census data shows homeownership rates dropped from almost 44% in 2004 to 37% this past fall, and the percentage of adult children ages 25 to 34 still living at home climbed from under 11% in the early 2000s to 16% in 2023. That's at least partly a function of home prices racing to record levels and mortgage rates surging to two-decade highs.Enrique Martinez Garcia, the international group head of the Dallas Fed's research department, told BI that slower generational progress has \"profound\" social and economic consequences.People taking longer to partner up and have kids can choke population and economic growth, he said. Those who can't afford a home are missing out on a reliable wealth-building strategy that underpins overall demand in the economy.Pricing out people also prevents them from moving across the country to where their labor is most valued. They may also have fewer or no children and slimmer retirement savings, Martinez Garcia said.Whether it's paying for day care, building a college fund, splurging on family vacations, or simply covering the living expenses of a whole other person or multiple people, having children comes with plenty of costs attached.\"The young people we interviewed were definitely worried about whether they would be able to earn enough to have families,\" Roberta Katz, a coauthor of \"Gen Z Explained: The Art of Living in a Digital Age\" and a senior research scholar at Stanford University, told BI.A 2023 Pew Research Center survey of childless US adults under 50 found that among those who said they were unlikely to ever have kids, 36% said a major reason was they couldn't afford to raise them.It's easier than ever to waste money when apps like Instagram and TikTok serve as virtual shopping malls, influencers urge their followers to emulate their lavish lifestyles, and digital payment services like Apple Pay and Afterpay make buying things quick and painless.Keisha Blair, a personal finance guru and author, told BI the \"convenience of digital payments and online transactions makes impulsive spending more accessible than ever\" for Gen Z.\"Social media further amplifies this, exposing them to a constant stream of influencers and aspirational lifestyles, fostering a culture of instant gratification and heightened consumerism,\" she added.Blair said that Gen Zers who wind up in debt and fall behind on their payments could do harm to their credit scores. That could prevent them from obtaining financing for a car or home, and frustrate their efforts to build wealth and become financially independent, she said.Laurel Road's Schaefer told BI that Instagram ads are so precisely targeted at her that she often clicks through and buys an item. But when she fears she's making an impulse purchase, she'll leave the product in her cart for at least 24 hours to give her time to decide whether she really wants it.Young people may feel like the odds are stacked against them, but they can still take \"concrete steps to achieve their dreams,\" Rod Griffin, Experian's senior director of consumer education and advocacy, told BI.He recommended taking control by drawing up and sticking to a budget, setting achievable goals, seeking professional guidance if needed, cutting back on impulse purchases, and eliminating \"sneaky expenses\" such as subscription fees.Gen Zers can also disregard the goals of past generations and focus on fulfilling their own ones instead. Elizabeth Husserl, author of \"The Power of Enough: Finding Joy in Your Relationship with Money,\" told BI that achieving classic adult milestones isn't always as rewarding as people expect.Young people can be more intentional and prioritize \"meaning, sufficiency, and fulfillment over relentless striving,\" Husserl said. Once they're clear about what truly matters to them, they might opt to co-live to cut their housing costs or pursue alternative education to avoid racking up debt, she said.They can \"redefine wealth on their own terms,\" perhaps by buying a house with a friend, or eschewing the corporate grind in favor of side hustles that offer flexibility and align with their personal values, she added.Read the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "By Maha El Dahan and Ahmed RasheedDUBAI/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's central bank will ban five more local banks from engaging in U.S. dollar transactions, a move that comes after meetings with U.S. Treasury officials in efforts to combat money laundering, dollar smuggling and other violations, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday.The move comes after meetings in Dubai last week between officials from the Central Bank of Iraq - which last year already banned eight banks from U.S. dollar transactions - and U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, one of the sources said.A rare ally of both the United States and Iran with more than $100 billion in reserves held in the U.S., Iraq relies heavily on Washington's goodwill to ensure that its access to oil revenues and finances are not blocked.But OPEC's second-largest producer may find itself in the crosshairs after U.S. President Donald Trump said this month he would restore his \"maximum pressure\" policy towards Iran.Iran views its neighbour and ally Iraq as an economic \"lung\" and wields considerable military, political and economic influence there through the powerful Shi'ite militias and political parties it backs. It also sources hard currency from Iraq through exports and avoids U.S. sanctions via its banking system.Reuters revealed in December a sophisticated fuel oil smuggling network, that generates at least $1 billion a year for Iran and its proxies, had flourished in Iraq since Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani took office in 2022.Banks banned from dollar transactions are allowed to continue operating and are allowed to engage in transactions in other currencies, the central bank says.But the move restricts the banks' ability to conduct transactions in dollars, hampering most operations conducted outside of Iraq.The current Iraqi government came to power with the support of powerful, Iran-backed parties and armed groups with interests in Iraq's highly informal economy, including the financial sector long seen as a money-laundering hot spot.Western officials had lauded cooperation with Prime Minister Sudani towards carrying out economic and financial reforms meant to curb the ability of Iran and its allies to access U.S. dollars, but pressure is expected to pile on with Trump's administration.The five banks are Al-Mashreq Al-Arabi Islamic Bank, United Bank for Investment, Al Sanam Islamic Bank, Misk Islamic Bank and Amin Iraq For Islamic Investment and Finance.The Central Bank of Iraq did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Treasury also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The move also included three payment services firms: Amawl, AL-Saqi Payment and Aqsa Payment.(Reporting by Maha El Dahan in Dubai and Ahmed Rasheed in Baghdad;Editing by David Holmes)"

That's catching up to some Americans and may snare more people, with inflation still not completely under control.Overall household debt climbed to a new high of $18.04 trillion in the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported last week. A lot of the increase came from inflating credit card balances, which increased by almost 4% to a record $1.21 trillion.Read more: The best ways to pay off credit card debtSome of those increases in debt over time can be chalked up to population growth. Others are seasonal. What's a little more concerning is the trajectory of serious delinquency rates, especially for auto loans and credit cards. The share of borrowers 90 days or more past due on those debts are at 14-year highs  which is not a coincidence.\"I really see a trend of automobile loan payments being very high and causing a lot of stress on how people pay for living expenses and [their] increasing reliance on credit,\" said Victor Russell, operations manager for Apprisen, a nonprofit credit counseling agency.Russell said those calling into his agency, which serves struggling Americans nationwide, span the earnings spectrum. The NY Fed report, too, noted that auto loan delinquencies specifically have been rising across credit score bands and income levels.Credit counselors at CCCS of the Savannah Area Inc. in Georgia are struggling to figure out a solution for one older gentleman who can no longer afford his car payment and his auto insurance premium, a category that has also surged. Motor vehicle insurance prices rose 2% in January from the month before and almost 12% from a year ago, according to the latest inflation data released this week.\"He has a decent-paying job. He cut expenses all across the way, but the car was the biggest expense,\" said Alexandra Nicosias-Kopp, director of operations at CCCS. \"That was a really tough situation that we're still figuring out.\"In general, a car payment should take up no more than 13%-14% of an individual's net income, Russell said. But with the average payment for used cars at $525 and for new cars at $734, per Experian, that rule of thumb is out the window.\"We're seeing individuals paying 21%-22% of their income toward car payments. That's almost a quarter of your income just servicing an automobile loan payment,\" Russell said. \"That's not sustainable.\"The term lengths on these loans have also increased to 78 months when they used to be 48 to 60 months long, Russell said, meaning people are stuck with unmanageable payments for more than six years. And that's why many of his clients are turning to credit cards for their basic living expenses. But with credit card rates averaging north of 20%, that just adds to their struggles.The strain could get worse.For one, credit card interest rates aren't going down anytime soon. Those rates are directly linked to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, and after this week's report showing inflation ticked back up in January, the Fed may delay any rate cuts even longer.At the same time, there's increased uncertainty over where consumer prices are going. Economists have warned that most of the tariffs the Trump administration plans to levy on imports will ultimately be paid for by consumers in the form of higher prices.That outlook alone is a good reason for Americans who are even just a little worried about their finances to reach out for advice. You don't need to wait until you're in dire straits to get in touch with a nonprofit credit counselor.\"The longer you wait and the worse things get, the fewer options you have, and it becomes more difficult to turn things around,\" McClary said. \"Act now rather than wait and see how things pan out.\"Janna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "One of fast tax tip to review before filing your 2024 federal income tax return is the IRS mileage rate.It's a much-talked-about deduction, but it's also a tax break that stalls out for plenty of drivers.Several years ago, many people could claim an itemized deduction for unreimbursed employee travel expenses. Now, though, if you work for a company who doesn't reimburse your mileage for travel, you're out of luck. The change in the tax rule is part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.However, a self-employed taxpayer who files a Schedule C can use the standard rate to deduct expenses from mileage incurred while doing business. You can only use one method  the standard mileage rate or the business portion of actual expenses  for the same vehicle.More tax season: Deductions and credits may boost your refund. Which ones are available to new filers?The 2024 standard mileage rate for business use of a vehicle is 67 cents a mile.The mileage rate is useful to know at tax time for those traveling for volunteer work and others.The 2024 mileage rate for use of your vehicle to do volunteer work for certain charitable organizations is 14 cents a mile. To claim that deduction, you must itemize your deductions, and not take the standard deduction, as the majority of taxpayers now do. This would be for unreimbursed expenses.About 90% of taxpayers claim the standard deduction now and do not itemize deductions.If you itemize, see Schedule A under the charitable deductions section.A key point from the IRS: \"The IRS will not allow deductions for volunteer travel unless there isno significant element of personal pleasure, recreation or vacation in such travel.\"The 2024 rate for operating expenses for a car when you use it for medical reasons is 21 cents a mile. The same rate of 21 cents per mile applies for specific moving purposes for qualified active-duty members of the Armed Forces.The IRS notes that under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for moving expenses, unless they are members of the Armed Forces on active duty moving under orders to a permanent change of station.Contact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Theres no need to hold back on European Central Bank interest rate cuts as the 2% price target is in sight and inflation risks are to the downside, Governing Council member Fabio Panetta said.Most Read from BloombergProgressive Portland Plots a ComebackWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltHow to Build a Neurodiverse CityA Filmmakers Surreal Journey Into His Own Private WinnipegSpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayMonetary policy continues to exert downward pressure on economic activity and on inflation, an effect that is less and less necessary with near-target inflation and persistently weak domestic demand, he said in a speech on Saturday in Turin. A less decisive easing of monetary policy could lead to excessively low inflation in the medium term.The ECB is weighing how quickly to lower borrowing costs and investors are currently pricing in more rate cuts until the deposit rate reaches 2% in the middle of this year. The central bank has lowered its key rate by 125 basis points since June. Policymakers have left little doubt on another quarter-point move in March, though its less clear what happens after that.Inflation, at 2.5% in January, is still expected to sustainably reach the 2% target in 2025. But some officials worry about upside risks from higher energy costs and trade tariffs, while others fret that the weak euro-zone economy could pull price growth below that goal.Panetta said borrowing costs are approaching the neutral rate, a level that neither restricts nor stimulates the economy. He also sees more downside than upside risks for inflation.At present, the main downside risk to inflation is weak economic activity, Panetta said. This is compounded by risks stemming from rising long-term yields in both dollars and yen.Economic ChallengesPanetta also said the European economy is facing a series of global challenges including a possible trade war with the US. To help strengthen growth, euro-area member states should invest more and better.Europe needs what I recently referred to as a European productivity compact. This does not mean creating a fiscal union, introducing an EU finance minister or establishing mechanisms for systematic transfers between countries, he said. Rather it involves setting up a common spending programme.Italys economy faltered last year, growing just 0.5%, or 0.7% if adjusting for calendar effects, Panetta said. That fell short of the governments 1% forecast. The Bank of Italy however expects the economy to resume its expansion in the coming months, he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undocumented Workers Who Helped Build Elon Musks Texas GigafactoryThe Unicorn Boom Is Over, and Startups Are Getting DesperateJapan Perfected 7-Eleven.

Read more: What is a good CD rate?When choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isnt the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Heres a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs:Bump-up CD: This type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the accounts term. However, youre usually allowed to \"bump up\" your rate just once.No-penalty CD: Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.Jumbo CD: These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In todays CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.Brokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "That old adage, Retire without debt, may be going the way of the electric typewriter and rotary phone.A new analysis from the personal finance site LendingTree finds that 97% of retirement-age adults have non-mortgage debt. The average balance: $11,349.Credit card debt is the most common type among seniors, the analysis found, with 93% carrying a balance, followed by auto loans (37%), personal loans (19%) and, surprisingly, student loans (8%). The study draws from credit reports for seniors ages 66 to 71 in the 50 largest American cities.The report comes at a time when retirement researchers are concerned about rising debt among seniors, a trend that inflation and high interest rates may have accelerated.What we found was that there are an awful lot of folks in retirement age who are carrying a fair amount of debt, said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. And when youre on a fixed income, in a time of rising prices and sky-high interest rates, thats a dicey proposition.Card debt may be more common among seniors, the report says, but auto debt is larger, accounting for one third of all debt. The average monthly car payment on a new vehicle now tops $700.Cars are so expensive now, Schulz said. And you can finance them for so long, at such a high rate, that its problematic for folks who are on a fixed income.Florida and Texas account for seven of the 10 cities with the most average debt among retirement-age seniors, the LendingTree study found. Here are the 10 metro areas where older Americans carry the most non-mortgage debt:San Antonio ($18,107 average debt)Jacksonville, Florida ($17,811)Dallas ($16,985)Houston ($16,101)Orlando, Florida ($15,945)Riverside, California ($15,727)New Orleans ($15,108)Austin, Texas ($15,046)Miami ($14,397)Memphis, Tennessee ($14,204)The cities with the least senior debt: Salt Lake City ($6,717, on average), San Jose, California ($6,731), Portland, Oregon ($6,782), Milwaukee ($6,931) and St. Louis ($7,466).The analysis examined the anonymized credit reports of 40,000 LendingTree users from 2024.Other recent reports suggest that a historically large share of retirees carry debt, especially credit card debt. Researchers see the trend as a sign of financial instability among older Americans.High interest-rate credit card debt is the most worrisome, because it can easily spiral out of control, said Catherine Collinson, CEO of the nonprofit Transamerica Institute for Retirement Studies.More than two-thirds of retirees with debt carry balances on their credit cards, according to the 2024 Spending in Retirement survey, released in November by the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI. The average credit card interest rate is 21.5%.The EBRI analysis found retirees were more likely to have credit card debt than other kinds.The share of older Americans with debt has risen over the decades. Among people 75 and older, 53% of households reported debt in the 2022 Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, up from 21% in 1989.In prior generations, common wisdom held that households should pay off their debt, including mortgage debt, before retirement.That sensibility is changing. Younger baby boomers came of age in the credit card era. Many seniors refinanced homes during a period of low interest rates that ended in 2022, restarting the clock on 15- and 30-year mortgages.Theres definitely a trend of people carrying debt in older age, which is a departure from previous generations, when paying off debt was a rite of passage and prerequisite for retirement, Collinson said.In a 2024 report, Transamerica found that more than half of baby boomers stated paying off debt as a priority, especially credit card and mortgage debt.Seniors are coping with credit card debt at a moment when retirees, along with the rest of America, face dual economic challenges of inflation and elevated interest rates. Unlike younger Americans, however, retirees tend to live on fixed incomes. They generally cannot go out and find a higher-paying job to manage their debt.The aging services professionals we work with around the country tell us that medical and credit card debt are increasingly common among the older adults they serve, said Ebony White, director of economic security and social safety net initiatives at the National Council on Aging. Too often, debt forces older adults to make difficult and potentially harmful tradeoffs, such as skipping medications or meals.The nonprofit council offers a free online Budget Checkup to help older adults with their finances.LendingTree and other sources offer these tips for older Americans struggling with debt:A higher interest rate means youre paying more interest every month on the money you borrowed. Theres a big difference, for example, between a 20% interest rate on a credit card balance and a 5% rate on a car loan.If you have high-interest debt, see if you qualify for a zero-interest credit card, and consider using it to pay down your debt more quickly.You can also call a creditor and try to negotiate a lower rate.Retirement is a good time, financial advisers say, to look for cost savings in the household budget.Do you still need that second car? Could you downsize to a smaller home? Does that summer trip have to be overseas? And what about all those streaming services?Consider setting aside an entire day, and spend it cutting costs.Collinson, at Transamerica, says she is surprised more retirement-age Americans arent actively planning for their retirement years. In one recent study, Transamerica found that fewer than two-thirds of retirees have an actual retirement plan.Were not seeing people at retirement age engaging in financial planning at the level that they should be, she said.Its never too late to meet with a financial planner, experts say, whether you are preparing for retirement or already living it.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 97% of retirement-age Americans are in debt.

This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.You can also get a quick idea of what your personalized interest rate might be based on your location, loan term, and loan amount. Enter the details here:The average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.53%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.The average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.87% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because youll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and thats 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.Lets say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.53% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,902, and youd pay $384,766 in interest over the life of your loan  on top of that original $300,000.If you get that same $300,000 mortgage but with a 15-year term and a 5.87% rate, your monthly payment would jump up to $2,511. But youd only pay $151,899 in interest over the years.With a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.An adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.Adjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, its possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.Dig deeper: Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgagesMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.Waiting for rates to drop probably isnt the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now unless you are truly in no rush and dont mind waiting until late 2025. If youre ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.To find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame  doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.When choosing a lender, dont just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR)  this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.Learn more: Best mortgage lenders for first-time home buyersAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.53%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.87%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.53% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).Mortgage rates aren't expected to drop drastically in the near future, though they may inch down here and there."

        "content": "Itsus maki-making robots are able to churn out almost 5,000 sushi pieces every single hour.Julian Metcalfe, the founder of the Asian takeaway chain, says the machines help his company do more with less at dozens of its sites across the UK.We remove repetitive, unskilled, boring jobs so we can invest more money paying trained team members to do high-quality, fresh food preparation on site, he says.Rachel Reeves wants more bosses to be like Metcalfe, investing in a way that creates a higher-skilled, more productive economy.The problem is, she has also just hit them with a 25bn tax raid that will reduce investment and, in the worst cases, lead to big job losses.Generally speaking, there is no doubt the ever-increasing costs of employing staff in the hospitality business  made worse by the recent National Insurance hikes  will reduce the likelihood of new hires being taken on, reduce opportunity and jobs, as well as raising prices for customers, says Metcalfe.That may sound devastating for the economy  but could it be part of the Chancellors grand plan?There is some speculation that the Chancellor is secretly hoping her 25bn tax raid will push companies to invest more in technology and training rather than simply relying on low-cost, low-skilled workers. Higher investment will in turn boost productivity.Higher productivity, which has been elusive since the financial crisis, is the key to unlocking higher living standards. When productivity improves, so do company profits and staff wages. This leads to stronger growth, a bigger economy, rising tax revenues and smaller borrowing bills.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Governments tax and spending watchdog, estimates that improving annual productivity growth by 0.5pc will reduce borrowing by more than 40bn by 2028-29  the exact same number as Reevess record tax raid.One of Reevess own advisers, the economist John Van Reenen, has suggested that a reliance on cheap labour is to blame for Britains economic crisis.Making labour more expensive may, therefore, be one way to fix the problem. The cost of employing someone on the minimum wage is set to rise above 24,000 this year once you take into account the rise in National Insurance.Investing in things like machinery and software can help to boost the productivity of individual workers. The maki-making robots, for example, leave Itsus workers with more time to serve customers.Not only could higher business investment boost the economy, it could also help wean Britain off a reliance on overseas workers to fill gaps in the jobs market.If this is part of the Chancellors logic, it is a high-risk gamble. The tax raid is expected to trigger potentially thousands of job losses. It could also end up leaving many unskilled workers on the scrap heap.Most economists will tell you that a bit of creative destruction is good for the economy. However, there are winners and losers.Kate Nicholls, boss of industry body UKHospitality, says: I think there was a justification to invest in productivity improvements and make the businesses more productive, but in sectors like hospitality that rely upon service and people, that seems very difficult to achieve.Nicholls argues that trying to force change by hiking National Insurance is regressive and disproportionately impacts the very sectors who cannot make the most of those kind of changes.I can see how it works  make it more expensive to employ someone in a factory or an office and automate it and make the job more productive and the factory more productive  but I dont see how that works in hospitality, she says.You can automate the ordering, the labour scheduling to free up some of the staff to do front line service rather than running between the two. But ultimately you cant take away service.Greg Thwaites, of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank, rejects the argument that Reeves had a hidden agenda to trigger creative destruction with her Budget.I think that they basically needed to raise a lot of money, and they wanted to be able to say with a straight-ish face that theyd done that without raising taxes on working people, he says.However, he says change is needed, even though it will involve job losses.In a recent report, the think tank said: If some sectors grow, others will have to shrink. Hospitality represents a higher share of consumption in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, because it is relatively cheap.Improving conditions for workers in this and other lower productivity sectors will over time change that. Better pay for low-earners in hospitality, paid for by higher prices that most affect better-off households, will create a more equal UK.Ashwin Kumar, of the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), says: The UK does have a problem with too many low paid staff not having opportunities for progression or any functional training beyond health and safety and induction.Many part-time workers have been left to languish on the sidelines because of the types of jobs that usually offer shorter hours.It means that lots and lots of women essentially who have to work part time are basically trading down in terms of the jobs they do, Kumar says. And thats manifestly a waste of our productivity.Productivity improvements may also  eventually  help to reduce Britains reliance on migration.Growth in employment within the health and social sectors, hotels and retail has almost all been entirely driven by non-EU born workers in recent years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) expects migration to drive all of Britains population growth for years to come.There are stories about people using agencies to recruit from overseas because its convenient for them, Kumar says.I think if we get to a position where employers end up having a more sustained commitment to staff, like banning zero-hours contracts, it will be a positive signal for who its worth recruiting.Because if companies are nudged to invest more in their people, they are going to want people who are also going to have more of a commitment to staying around.Not everyone agrees.Many business leaders warn that the pledge by Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, to strengthen workers rights will discourage companies from taking a chance on workers who are young or with fewer skills  the very people that Reeves says she wants to help get back into work.There is also the big question about how far we can automate. Metcalfe recently said he was reversing some of Itsus use of robots.Its a question of balance, he says. I think some business will over-automate and lose customers.The harmony between good value for money, quality handmade food and the use of modern technology is elusive. No humans should ever be left on any scrap heap. What a depressing thought.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "content": "Chinese start-up Manycore Tech, operator of the world's largest spatial design platform, has applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong, three years after its attempt to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange lapsed.Manycore's IPO filing, jointly sponsored by JPMorgan and CCB International, did not provide the amount it intends to raise in Hong Kong. A Bloomberg report last year said the company was eyeing US$200 million in potential proceeds.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Citing data from research firm Frost & Sullivan, Manycore touted its position as \"the world's largest spatial design platform, as measured by the number of average monthly active users in 2023, and also the largest software provider in China's spatial design industry as measured by revenue\" in the same year, according to the start-up's filing on Friday.Spatial design deals with a more conceptual and analytical approach to studying how spaces affect human behaviour and social interaction. By comparison, interior design focuses more on the practical and aesthetic elements that make spaces functional and visually appealing.Founded in 2011 by three Chinese graduates of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Manycore has raised funds from major investment firms including IDG Capital, Hillhouse Investment and Coatue Management. Manycore's valuation reached US$2 billion after a funding round in 2020, according to furnishing industrial media 77d.The proposed IPO of Manycore, which operates primarily under a subscription model, is likely to further burnish the credentials of Hangzhou - home to e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding - as a pre-eminent tech hub in China, along with Shenzhen in southern Guangdong province. Manycore is the first of Hangzhou's little dragons to file for public listing.

The firm's platform can automatically transform user-uploaded files, such as computer-aided design drawings, advertisement layouts and graphic designs into photorealistic images and immersive 3D design schemes.In 2024, Manycore's platform generated more than 640.6 million images including floor plan visualisations, e-commerce product images, lighting effect images and other content with optimised renderings.The company's revenue for the nine months ended September 30 last year reached 552.9 million yuan, up from 486 million yuan in the same period in 2023. Losses in the January-September period last year narrowed to 422.1 million yuan, from 489.5 million yuan in the same period in 2023.Offering both free and paid subscription, Manycore's products amassed average monthly active users of 2.7 million in 2024. Its enterprise customers reached 45,500 at the end of September last year, up 11 per cent from a year earlier. Individual users rose 6 per cent to 413,900 during the same period, according to the company's filing.In 2021, Manycore filed for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not proceed any further. At the time, the Chinese government cracked down on the country's Big Tech sector. The previous year, the dual listing of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group in Hong Kong and Shanghai was scuttled. Beijing also conducted a cybersecurity review of ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing after it went public in the US in June 2021. Didi delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2022.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "The S&P 500 may be trading near records, but investors aren't feeling totally at ease.A sense of complacency in markets may be magnifying risks, a strategist said.A crisis in China's economy and Big Tech valuations \"running on fumes\" are also threats to the market.Even with the S&P 500 trading near record highs, there's always something for investors to worry about.On Wall Street, it's called the \"wall of worry,\" and investors must continually climb it.\"Unfortunately, sometimes Mr. Market can lose his footing on the way up,\" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider.Some of the bricks the make up the wall of worry right now include the potential for a trade war following the Trump administration's tariffs, an ever-growing government spending deficit, and uncertainty around the longevity of the AI tech trade.\"If we get into a widespread and prolonged trade war, or some unexpected shock to the system were to occur, then the market could be at risk of a very large drop\" of 20% or more, Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, told BI.Then there's the fact that everyone on Wall Street seems conditioned to buy the dip.\"One of my concerns is that the longer we go without a correction, the more invulnerable investors feel, and the more emboldened that traders become about buying every dip,\" Sosnick said.\"Every so often, there is a dip that is not a buying opportunity, but instead the early stages of something more significant. That's when the problems arise,\" he added.As for what might trigger \"something more significant,\" a sudden spike in bond yields is a likely candidate.While the 10-year US Treasury yield has softened this year and dipped back below 4.50%, a swift rise toward 5% could trigger a stock sell-off.Budget concerns could send yields soaring if the Trump administration follows through with more tax cuts that aren't balanced out by cuts to spending. A trade war, meanwhile, could also put upside pressure on bond yields.\"Bear in mind that foreigners buy huge quantities of US government debt. If trade or political tensions become dire enough for them to reduce their purchases, that could push yields higher by themselves,\" Sosnick said.An \"unexpected recession\" driven entirely by outside forces could also be on the table.\"Many US investors aren't paying attention to the real estate crisis in China, but just like our real estate crisis triggered the global financial crisis, it is quite possible that a debt implosion in China could cause problems outside its borders,\" Sosnick said.China's property sector has been mired in a crisis since the default of Evergrande Group in 2021, and the country is dealing with an enormous amount of distressed debt, much of it tied to its real estate market.For Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, stocks could be due for weakness after a technical sell signal flashed in January.It's called the December Low indicator, and it occurs when the S&P 500 closes below the December low close in the first quarter.That signal flashed on January 10, when the S&P 500's close of 5,827 was 50 points below December's closing low of 5,867.Since 1950, this December Low indicator has flashed a sell signal 37 times, and the results are not pretty.\"The full year returns were plain and simple much weaker,\" Detrick said in a recent note, highlighting an average full-year return of -0.2% and a win-ratio of 48.6%.\"This is one thing that undoubtedly is in my worry column,\" he added.Finally, stock market valuations above historical levels are an ongoing concern, Charlie Ashley, portfolio manager at Catalyst Funds, said.Ashley told BI that because mega-cap tech stocks are \"running on fumes,\" investors should consider owning less expensive areas of the market, like small-cap stocks or an equally weighted S&P 500 fund.Read the original article on Business Insider"

        "source": "Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A federal judge in Washington temporarily ordered the Trump administration to halt efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Friday, barring officials from laying off staff, deleting data, or emptying its reserve funds.The ruling came in response to a union lawsuit, which alleged that the Trump administration was planning to hollow out the CFPB by firing 95% of its workers while canceling the lease on its Washington, D.C., headquarters. If successful, the mass layoffs would have left behind only the skeleton of an agency charged with policing the way large banks and other financial services companies like payday lenders and credit bureaus handle customers.The CFPB is currently shuttered after acting Director Russell Vought ordered staff to stop virtually all work and stay home from the office this week. It had also begun laying off dozens of staff and canceling contracts with vendors and expert witnesses.Administration officials have been open about their goal of eliminating the agency: After members of his DOGE team arrived at its headquarters last week, billionaire Elon Musk posted, RIP CFPB, while President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that it was very important to get rid of.It was also a waste, he said. There was a bad group of people running it. ... That was a vicious group of people. They destroyed a lot of people.The temporary order by Senior Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the US District Court for the District of Columbia will not lift Vought's work stoppage. But the plaintiffs, which include a federal employees union as well as nonprofits that work with the CFPB, nonetheless celebrated the development.\"Doing away with this critical agency would massively increase fraud, the scourge that Musk allegedly aims to curtail, along with supercharging scams, excess fees and charges, and assorted ripoffs,\" said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the progressive group Public Citizen, whose attorneys represented some of the plaintiffs. \"Today a judge halted the illegal move by the administration to stop the critical work of the CFPB.\"The lawsuit, originally filed on Thursday, argued that the mass layoffs would leave the bureau unable to perform its basic functions required by law. In an accompanying filing, the agency's former chief technologist also warned that deleting its internal data risked permanently harming its ability to regulate financial institutions and assist consumers.Trump and Voughts actions to disable the CFPB have already caused mass confusion and imposed significant and irreparable harm on consumers across the country, the lawsuit states. Absent immediate relief, the defendants will continue to upend the lives of countless civil servants.Among other tasks required by statute, the CFPB has paused all of its supervision over banks and other lenders, the lawsuit notes. The agencys portal for consumer complaints has also been severely disrupted. The agency typically receives hundreds of thousands of complaints each month.According to the suit, Vought has been planning to return the CFPBs operating reserves back to the Federal Reserve, which funds the agency. Over the weekend, he informed the Fed that the consumer watchdog would not require any new funding for the coming quarter because he planned to spend down its reserves.The lawsuit did not cite a source about the mass firings, but rumors have swirled among current and former staffers that mass firings may be imminent. It states that Trump officials have reportedly informed the General Services Administration that they are terminating the lease of the CFPBs headquarters.The clash over the CFPB is shaping up to be another key test of the Trump administrations power to unilaterally reshape the federal bureaucracy. The agency was created by Congress as part of 2010s Dodd-Frank Act, partly in order to prevent the sorts of predatory lending practices that had contributed to the 2007-2008 housing and financial crisis.The lawsuit argues that by tearing the agency down to less than its studs, the Trump administration is attempting to usurp powers reserved for Congress and failing to faithfully execute the laws as required by the Constitution. The CFPB can be eliminated only by Congress, it states.The CFPB is not the only part of the government facing mass layoffs. Agencies have begun letting go thousands of probationary employees, who have worked in the government for less than a year and are legally easier to dismiss than their colleagues with longer tenures. Department of Housing and Urban Development leaders have been told to lay off 50% of its workforce, per Bloomberg Law.But courts have already stepped in to at least temporarily stop some firings. On Thursday, a federal judge extended his order blocking the Trump administration from putting thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave as part of its efforts to wipe out the agency.A hearing for a longer preliminary injunction that could block the Trump administration's attempts to curtail the CFPB is scheduled for early next month.Jordan Weissmann is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.This post has been updated.Click here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and moreRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. When engaging in a real estate transaction, it's important to understand the details of your mortgage agreement - especially clauses that dictate how ownership can be transferred. One such provision is the alienation clause, which prevents a borrower from transferring ownership of a property without first paying off the mortgage. For homebuyers, real estate investors and sellers, knowing how an alienation clause works can help avoid unexpected complications when selling or refinancing a property.If youre planning to buy, sell or transfer property ownership, it can be a good idea to work with a financial advisor. An alienation clause - also referred to as a due-on-sale clause - requires the borrower to pay off the remaining mortgage balance before transferring ownership. It applies primarily to conventional mortgages and not government-backed loans like FHA or VA loans, which allow loan assumptions under certain conditions.The alienation clause requires new buyers to secure their own financing, allowing the lender to evaluate their creditworthiness and set appropriate mortgage rates. Without this clause, a buyer could take over a loan at a lower interest rate, potentially leading to losses for the lender and exposing them to additional risk. However, a few exceptions do exist for borrowers, the most common being transfer of ownership as part of an inheritance due to death or illness.While an alienation clause is triggered by the sale or transfer of property, an acceleration clause is activated when the borrower violates loan terms - such as failing to make payments. If an acceleration clause is enforced, the lender can demand immediate repayment of the outstanding loan balance, even if the borrower has not transferred ownership. Both clauses allow lenders to mitigate financial risks by requiring full loan repayment under specific circumstances.Alienation clauses are common in fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages, wherelenders maintain control over loan repayment and refinancing. Here's how the clause typically functions:A homeowner decides to sell. When a homeowner lists their property for sale, they must consider the mortgage terms, including the alienation clause.A buyer purchases the property. If the home sells, the seller must use the sale proceeds to pay off their remaining mortgage balance before transferring ownership to the buyer.Lender enforces the clause. If the seller attempts to transfer the property without paying off the mortgage, the lender has the right to demand immediate repayment of the loan balance.In some cases, homeowners may attempt to transfer property through a quitclaim deed to a family member or business entity. If an alienation clause is in place, the lender can still demand full repayment, preventing unauthorized transfers.Although alienation clauses are typically enforced, certain situations allow homeowners to transfer property ownership without triggering the clause. Below are six common exceptions:Inheritance transfers: When a property is inherited, many lenders allow the new owner to assume the existing mortgage repayments without requiring the full balance upon transfer.Transfers to a living trust: Some lenders permit homeowners to transfer property into a revocable living trust without triggering the alienation clause. However, the original borrower must remain the primary beneficiary and occupant of the home. This exception allows homeowners to engage in estate planning while maintaining their mortgage terms.Divorce or separation agreements: If a property is awarded to one spouse in a divorce settlement, many lenders allow the remaining spouse to assume the mortgage without requiring immediate repayment. However, refinancing may still be necessary if the departing spouse wants to remove their name from the loan.Assumable loans: Certain government-backed loans - such as FHA, VA and USDA loans - are assumable mortgages that do not contain an alienation clause. This means a new buyer may take over the seller's loan, with lender approval.Property transfers between family members: Some lenders allow homeowners to transfer property to immediate family members - such as parents, children or siblings - without enforcing the alienation clause. However, this is subject to lender discretion, and borrowers should review their loan agreements to confirm eligibility.Lender approval or waiver: In certain situations, a lender may waive the alienation clause if the borrower meets specific criteria. For example, if a buyer agrees to refinance with the same lender, they may permit the transfer without requiring immediate full repayment.An alienation clause is an important provision in mortgage agreements that prevents new buyers from assuming an existing mortgage without repayment of the original loan or approval from the lender. There are some exceptions, such as inheritance, divorce settlements and government-backed loan assumptions, so individuals navigating a home sale, transfer or refinancing, should understand how an alienation clause might impact the transaction. Working with a financial advisor or real estate advisor can provide clarity on loan terms, potential exemptions and the best financial strategies for managing real estate transactions.A financial advisor can help you buy a home by assessing their financial situation, advising on budgeting and savings strategies.

But the for-profit company is a subsidiary of a nonprofit entity that's bound to a mission  which Musk helped set  to safely build better-than-human AI for humanity's benefit. OpenAI is now seeking to more fully convert itself to a for-profit company, but would first have to buy out the nonprofit's assets.Throwing a wrench in those plans, Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a group of investment firms announced a bid Monday to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI. Musk in a court filing Wednesday further detailed the proposal to acquire the nonprofits controlling stake.Savitt's letter Friday said that court filing added new material conditions to the proposal. As a result of that filing, it is now apparent that your clients much-publicized bid is in fact not a bid at all. In any event, even as first presented, the board has unanimously rejected it, Savitt said.Musk has alleged in the lawsuit that OpenAI is violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including OpenAI's business partner Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would halt OpenAIs for-profit conversion. Musk also added xAI as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was also unfairly stifling business competition. A judge is still considering Musk's request but expressed skepticism about some of his claims in a court hearing last week.The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of APs text archives."

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. If you want to meet Wyoming residency requirements for taxes you must have a primary and permanent home in the state. Factors such as property ownership, vehicle registration, voter registration and time spent in the state also contribute to determining residency status. Additionally, individuals may need to update their drivers license and mailing address while severing ties with their previous state of residence. Establishing clear intent to reside in Wyoming can help avoid complications with tax authorities from other states that may still claim tax obligations. A financial advisor can help you learn more about state tax requirements and rates.Wyoming has no personal income tax, making it an attractive option for those looking to establish residency. But, this also means that residency requirements for tax purposes primarily involve establishing domicile  the place considered a person's permanent home. To be recognized as a legal resident for tax and other legal matters, an individual must demonstrate an intent to make Wyoming their primary residence and sever ties with their previous state.While Wyoming law does not specify a minimum number of days required to establish residency, individuals who spend more than 183 days per year in another state may still be subject to that state's tax laws.People moving from states with high taxes could face scrutiny from tax authorities in their former state. So, its important to document your intent to move. Wyoming doesnt ask for formal statements or affidavits to prove residency, but having consistent evidence that you live and work there helps establish your tax domicile. A tax consultant can also help explain what you need to do.Entrepreneurs looking to avoid taxes from their previous state need to establish their personal home and make sure that their business mainly operates in Wyoming. This involves registering the business with the Wyoming Secretary of State, keeping a local office or physical presence through yourself or a registered agent, and potentially hiring local employees.If youre moving from a high-tax state, maintaining business connections there can challenge your new residency status. For example, if you run a Wyoming LLC but still handle operations, meet clients, or earn significant income in your old state, that state may still want to tax your earnings. To reduce this risk, move your operations to Wyoming, use a Wyoming-based registered agent, and make management decisions within the state to reinforce your residency claim.Here are two examples to show how a move from a high-paying state to Wyoming can impact your taxes.First, let's take a look at a business owner from New York. They relocate to Wyoming to avoid state income taxes. Then, they buy a home in Casper, update their driver's license, register to vote, and open a Wyoming-based bank account. They also relocate their business headquarters to Wyoming, switch to a local doctor and spend most of the year there.When New York income tax authorities review their case, they confirm no remaining ties to the Empire State, as the owner has no property, bank accounts, or business interests left there and spends less than 183 days in the state, solidifying their residency in Wyoming.Now, for a second example, let's take a look at a semi-retired consultant from California. They move to Wyoming but keep a second home in Los Angeles, where they spend their summers. They continue to use a California doctor and bank with a Los Angeles branch.During an audit, Californias tax authorities discover that the consultant spent more than 183 days in the state and still maintains significant ties there. As a result, despite their Wyoming residency claim, California deems them a resident for tax purposes, requiring them to pay state income tax.Wyomings absence of state income tax and favorable business policies attracts individuals seeking lower taxes. However, moving to Wyoming for tax reasons requires more than just a new address. Previous states may still claim taxes, and Wyomings cost of living and lifestyle might not be suitable for everyone.If you plan to move to Wyoming, here are four advantages to consider:No state income tax: Wyoming stands out by not taxing personal income, retirement income, or capital gains, providing significant savings for residents compared to states with higher tax rates.Business-friendly environment: Wyoming is particularly favorable for business owners due to the absence of corporate income taxes, franchise taxes, and gross receipts taxes. This welcoming tax structure can facilitate business growth and attract entrepreneurs.Low property taxes: Property owners in Wyoming benefit from one of the lowest property tax rates in the United States. This can lead to considerable savings on real estate investments and residential properties compared to other states.Privacy protections: Wyoming offers exceptional privacy protections, including strong asset protection laws. Importantly, it maintains confidentiality by not requiring public disclosure of LLC ownership, which can be crucial for business owners seeking anonymity and security.Before you move to Wyoming, consider these four tax disadvantages:Property taxes: Although Wyoming has no state income tax, its property taxes, while generally lower than the national average, might still be a concern for those moving from states with significantly lower property tax rates.Sales tax: Wyoming imposes a state sales tax, and localities can add additional sales taxes. Depending on the specific locality, the combined sales tax can be higher than in some states with lower state-level sales taxes.Limited tax benefits for renters: Unlike some states that offer income tax credits or deductions to renters, Wyoming's lack of state income tax means there are no state tax benefits specifically for renters, which could be a disadvantage for non-homeowners.Estate tax considerations: While Wyoming does not have its own estate or inheritance tax, residents are still subject to federal estate taxes. For those with significant assets, the lack of state-level estate tax breaks or credits that might be available in other states could be a drawback.Moving to Wyoming can offer tax benefits, but you must clearly establish residency to avoid issues with tax authorities from other states. Business owners need to move their operations to Wyoming to escape tax duties from their previous states. While the lack of state income tax and a favorable business environment are attractive, consider other factors like the local climate, available amenities, and the possibility of residency audits before deciding.A financial advisor can help you create a plan to minimize your tax liability.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Decoding Retirement on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.Despite all the talk of a retirement crisis in the US, there is some encouraging news: A significant share of middle-income households  those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 per year  are setting aside roughly 8% of their income for retirement, according to a Principal Real Life Retirement Journeys survey.With an employer match, that savings rate can rise to 12%, according to Jean Chatzky, host of the Her Money podcast, putting it within the 10% to 15% range that retirement experts typically recommend.\"Would I like to see them get to 15%?\" Chatzky asked in a recent episode of Decoding Retirement (listen below). \"Absolutely. We know that if you can save 15% over a really long period of time  decades, your working career  then when you get to retirement and you combine your savings with Social Security, you will generally have enough to replace 75% to 80% of your pre-retirement income.\"This embedded content is not available in your region.Overall, the trend is going in the right direction.This savings rate \"is pretty good,\" Chatzky said, especially in light of other studies that have found that some people save only a small percentage of their income, sometimes in the low single digits, and other individuals have less than $400 set aside for emergencies.\"When we talk about a retirement savings crisis in this country ... what that number says to me is that maybe things are actually turning around,\" Chatzky said.Of course, even if you're saving 15%, it's helpful to know how much you'll need to accumulate in your nest egg to fund your desired standard of living in retirement, Chatzky said.\"Sometimes it is tough to get ourselves to save if we don't know where the goal line is,\" she said. \"But many experts will suggest that by the time you retire, you have about 10 times your salary put away for retirement.\"Read more: How much money should I have saved by 50?In other words, if your financial salary is $100,000, you'll need $1 million earmarked for retirement, and if your salary is $200,000, you'll need $2 million set aside for retirement.\"Saving that amount of money takes a really long time,\" Chatzky said.But putting your money to work through compounding can make a big difference. When people reflect on their retirement savings, Chatzky said many say they wish they had started earlier.According to Chatzky, automatic enrollment and auto-escalation have made saving in 401(k) plans easier and significantly increased retirement savings. Automatic enrollment, which enrolls employees in their employer's 401(k) plan unless they opt out, has significantly increased participation rates. And auto-escalation, which incrementally increases contributions annually, helps employees reach optimal savings levels.\"My favorite tip is to lean into technology,\" Chatzky said.She noted that, according to an AARP study, people are 15 times more likely to save for retirement when they have access to a workplace plan and 20 times more likely if their workplace savings are automatic.\"If you have a workplace plan available to you, get in it,\" she said. \"Grab all the matching dollars that you can, and take a page from auto-escalation and continue to bump up your contribution every time that you get a raise until you are maxing out. That is the very, very best thing that you can do. If you can do more, then put money into your 401(k) or whatever account you have at work.\"In the podcast, Chatzky also emphasized the importance of maximizing all available retirement savings accounts, including Roth accounts, traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, health savings accounts (HSA), nondeductible IRAs, 529 plans, and taxable accounts.Read more: Retirement planning: A step-by-step guideThe Principal study found that 78% of nonsavers still intend to save for retirement in the future. However, they cite high expenses, low income, and debt repayment as the primary barriers preventing them from saving now.\"They're real challenges,\" Chatzky said.Expenses have risen significantly in recent years due to inflation, and while inflation has moderated, prices remain higher than they were a few years ago, making everything from buying a home or car to grocery shopping more difficult.Additionally, while wages have increased, they haven't kept pace with the cost of living for some workers. At the same time, consumer debt has been rising, with many people carrying holiday debt that they may not be able to pay off until well into 2025.Read more: How to pay off credit card debt when your budget's tight\"A lot of people these days spend very quickly and often very unconsciously,\" Chatzky said. \"We have a lot of subscriptions. We tap our cards and swipe our cards and dip our cards without thinking about it. We use one-click ordering on Amazon a little bit too easily, and as a result, our money is flowing through our fingers in a very, very quick way and we are not paying that much attention.\"The way to turn this scenario around, she said, is by doing \"backwards budgeting,\" which she does in her FinanceFixx coaching program at HerMoney.\"You look at where your money is going, and you break it down into categories and you ask yourself, 'Where can I make some small but meaningful changes?'\" Chatzky said.Doing this can free up a little cash each month that can be used, for instance, to pay down debt.And as part of this exercise, you might find you are spending much more than you thought on food. Chatzky said meal planning is one trick that can make a big difference in saving money on groceries.Subscriptions are also a big culprit. \"The average household during the pandemic had 24 different subscriptions, and if you haven't looked at them in a while, chances are pretty good that you're not using at least some of them and could cancel them,\" she said.\"So pay a little bit of attention, make some changes, and that'll start taking you in the right direction,\" she said.And if you haven't checked your credit score in a while and are carrying high-interest credit card debt, Chatzky said improving your score could help you secure lower interest rates. Consider options like balance transfers or debt consolidation to reduce your interest costs and make repayment more manageable.Each Tuesday, retirement expert and financial educator Robert Powell gives you the tools to plan for your future on Decoding Retirement.

But in a court filing, lawyers for Blue Cross and Lisa Domski asked a federal judge to put her case on hold Thursday while they work with a mediator to try to reach a global resolution over similar lawsuits.Blue Cross and Noah Hurwitz, the attorney representing Domski and many other former employees, declined to comment further Friday.Domski, an IT specialist, said she was a victim of religious discrimination. Blue Cross in 2021 did not grant an exemption from its COVID-19 vaccine policy, despite her insistence that the vaccine clashed with her Catholic beliefs.Blue Cross denied any discrimination and said it believed Domski lacked a sincere religious belief.A jury in November awarded Domski about $1.7 million in lost pay, $1 million in noneconomic damages and $10 million in punitive damages.U.S. District Judge David Lawson heard arguments in January about reducing the amount. But he didn't make an immediate decision. Domski's lawyers acknowledged that punitive damages cannot exceed $300,000."

You have spent your working years building wealth, and now its time to manage and spend that money. By and large, this is true  your financial perspective will change significantly once you no longer have a normal stream of income. However, its important to remember that retirement involves many of the same concerns and focuses that youve always had with your money, from tax planning, household budgeting and even inflation.Your asset allocation and portfolio composition remain just as important in retirement as they were during your working years. And if youre 62 and planning to retire soon, structuring your portfolio appropriately is paramount to ensuring your money lasts.A financial advisor can help you build and manage your investment portfolio throughout retirement. Find and speak with a financial advisor today. Retirees in America can expect an average lifespan in their 80s. This depends on several factors, but ultimately if you are 62 you should anticipate living another 20-25 years, and hopefully significantly more.This means that you need to plan for longevity and continued portfolio growth. One of the essential issues here will be to find a good balance between risk management and accumulation. You want to keep this money safe, but you dont want it to spend the next 25 years languishing in a savings account, earning less interest than some investments can offer.One approach, for example, is to break your portfolio into sections or buckets based on your wants, needs and capacity for growth. Calculate the monthly budget you will need for necessities, then plan to generate that income through secure assets like bonds or annuities. Take another section of your portfolio and earmark it for your lifestyle  the money you want but could (literally) live without, and invest that in a more mixed collection of secure and growth assets.Take the remainder and put it into a long-term growth portfolio more focused on equities. This is your future money, the growth that will keep building your wealth against future spending and inflation.Whichever way you choose to structure your portfolio, the core issue is to balance your competing needs for security and growth. Use more secure assets to pay the bills and use more speculative assets to build ongoing wealth, because retirement is not the end of your money management. Its just the next phase of it.If you need help choosing an asset allocation and portfolio composition appropriate for your age and risk tolerance, consider speaking with a financial advisor.Thinking about retirement means thinking in longer terms than most households are used to. Instead of planning for the coming months, its time to plan for the years and decades that lie ahead. This means paying attention to long-term costs.Among other issues, youll want to anticipate inflation. Even at the Federal Reserves 2% benchmark rate, inflation will double your cost of living every 35 years or so. These costs of living increases are one reason why you should plan for growth, not just security, in your portfolio. Your money needs to keep pace with the rising costs of goods and services.While youre at it, dont forget about taxes. Unless you hold assets in a Roth portfolio, you will pay income taxes on all of your withdrawals. This is an easy asterisk to miss, so dont forget that $100,000 in distributions will mean living on more like $70,000  $80,000, depending on where you live. Based on your tax status and cash on-hand, a Roth IRA conversion might help you mitigate those taxes significantly.Finally, theres the longest-term planning of all. You dont necessarily have to begin complete estate planning at 62, at least not beyond the basic assignments all adults should have in their desk drawer. But, it is something to prepare for. Sooner rather than later you will want to create a true estate plan, and as you structure your portfolio for growth and drawdowns, make sure to anticipate it.Your portfolio is a source of income, but its important to stay on top of your spending, too. So keep an eye on your household budget.As you enter retirement, plan out your households budget. How much do you spend? What do you need? What do you want? What kind of lifestyle do you want to have? All of these issues will be important as you move to a more fixed income with fewer opportunities to give yourself a raise in the years ahead. As noted above, this kind of budgeting is also essential for portfolio management. You will need to know your needs to understand how you can invest around growth and security.While you do, dont forget to anticipate areas of new or growing costs   specifically, healthcare. You May need additional insurance, including gap insurance or long-term care insurance, and these will add new monthly costs.You may also have increased out-of-pocket health care costs as well. Hopefully, these expenses wont set in immediately, but you should budget for more medical spending as the years go on. This money will have to come from somewhere, and the sooner you plan for it the better you can afford it. A financial advisor can help you anticipate these expenses and make a plan for paying for them.As you enter retirement, its important to start planning for how your spending, budget and investments will change. Calculate your spending and what kind of investing you need to meet that budget, because the end of work doesnt mean the end of managing your money. The answers will help inform how you structure your portfolio and allocate your assets.A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard. SmartAssets free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If youre ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.We spend so much time focused on how to save and invest for retirement that its easy to forget about the importance of how you invest during retirement. This kind of investment is critical, so its important to learn how to do it.Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

        "content": "I lost my job last year and need to take care of a parent. In doing that, I must withdraw money from my retirement. I dont understand the tax implications and penalties. I would also like access to any savings I have without restrictions or penalties. When I start my new job, what should I invest in going forward? I do not want another situation that comes up where the only way I can get my money is to take a huge penalty. The bulk of my money is in a traditional IRA and theres a little in a Roth.Im sorry to hear that youre dealing with these struggles and glad you asked about the best way to manage your retirement account withdrawals. Doing this the right way can help minimize your tax burden. That is especially important when preserving resources is crucial.Most financial advisors caution against pulling money out of retirement accounts before retirement age. But when thats the only way you can meet your essential expenses, such as housing, food and medicine, without getting buried in high-interest debt, its the right move. And youll want to do it in the most tax-efficient way.Though you own the money in your retirement accounts, withdrawals before the official retirement age are restricted. The rules can be complicated but having a solid understanding of them can help you avoid paying IRS penalties.In most cases, taking early distributions from retirement accounts will result in your getting less money than you need unless you account for the taxes and penalties. For example, say you need $10,000. Between the 10% early withdrawal penalty and the average 25% for federal and state income taxes, you may end up with only $6,500 cash in hand. To end up with the full $10,000, youll need to withdraw more than that from your retirement account.I strongly advise working with a financial advisor when youre working through this. They know strategies to minimize the taxes and penalties on your withdrawals and may have suggestions for other resources you could tap into.Heres what you need to know about the consequences of premature retirement distributions and potential ways to limit the damage.Taking Money From a Traditional IRAThe general rule for traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) is this: If you take money before you reach age 59 1/2, youll pay regular income taxes on the withdrawal plus a 10% penalty. But there are some exceptions where you can avoid that extra 10% hit. Those include:Health insurance premiums you pay while youre unemployedComplete and permanent disabilityUnreimbursed medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI)Up to $10,000 for a first-time home purchaseQualified higher education expensesIf any of the exceptions apply to you, youll report them on IRS Form 5329 when you file your income tax return.If youre really strapped for cash, you can elect to not have any taxes withheld, but that could leave you with an unmanageable tax bill when you file your return.Withdrawing From Your 401(k)The process for early 401(k) withdrawals adds an extra layer to deal with: your employers rules. In most cases, if youve separated from your employer for any reason, you wont be able to access your money until you hit retirement age. Thats true unless you roll over the account into an IRA. Once you do that, the regular traditional IRA rules will apply.While youre still working at the job with the 401(k), your employer decides whether you can take early withdrawals or borrow money from your account. That information should be included in the plan documents. Alternatively, you can check in with the human resources or payroll departments to find out if either option is available. If you can take money out, youll have to decide which options make more sense for you. A financial advisor may help you understand the impacts of your investment and income decisions.Taking a Loan From Your 401(k)Borrowing from your 401(k) seems like the hands-down better option, but it does come with some drawbacks. On the plus side, a loan doesnt have any tax impact and youll pay yourself back with interest. That can help rebuild your retirement savings at least a little.On the downside:Loan repayments usually get automatically deducted from your paycheck, reducing your take-home pay.Payments usually start with the very next check, which will impact your current cash flow when youre already struggling.Most employers wont let you make any contributions while you have a loan outstanding.If you leave your job for any reason, including getting fired or laid off, you have to pay the loan back in full right away. If you cant, it will be treated like an early withdrawal, subject to taxes and the 10% penalty.Taking an Early Withdrawal From Your 401(k)If your employer allows early withdrawals, the money you take out will be subject to withholding taxes and penalties, just like an IRA withdrawal.Also, be aware that the hardship withdrawal rules are slightly different for 401(k) plans. First, you can only take out your contributions and employer matches, but not any account earnings. Second, there are fewer exceptions to the 10% penalty than there are for IRAs.Withdrawing From Your Roth IRAWith Roth IRAs, youve already paid taxes on the money you contributed, so that money is yours to withdraw at any time. But the rules for any earnings that have accumulated in your Roth  dividend income, for example  come with strings attached. If you pull out any amount more than you put in, it will be subject to taxes and penalties if youre younger than retirement age.That makes Roth IRAs your best first choice when you need to dip into retirement savings without dealing with extra taxes. Make sure you withdraw only what you put in, or you will end up with a tax and penalty situation.Consider speaking with a financial advisor to explore the tradeoffs in your situation.Next StepsAs your finances stabilize, youll want to replenish emergency savings and nonretirement resources along with retirement accounts. Thats especially important when youre dealing with an ongoing hardship situation.In that case, youll want to rebuild accessible emergency savings first. Make sure this money goes into an FDIC-insured bank account as you cannot afford to lose any of it. Keep this cash at least one step away from your regular checking account so youre not tempted to use it for nonemergencies.After that, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA. Youll miss out on the immediate tax benefit, but youll be able to withdraw that money tax and penalty-free when you need it  with the added bonus that all earnings will be tax-free once you reach retirement age.Next, contribute what you can to your employer-based retirement plan, especially if they offer matching contributions. Finally, fund non-retirement savings and investment accounts. They dont offer tax advantages but you wont face additional taxes or penalties when you use that money.Investing and Retirement Planning TipsConsider working with a financial advisor for guidance on how to handle retirement accounts. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesnt have to be hard.

One of the biggest surprises would-be retirees face when planning their retirement finances is the fact that their Social Security benefits could very well be subject to income tax.A financial advisor can help you plan for Social Security and potentially minimize your tax bill on your benefits. Connect with a fiduciary advisor today.One reason for the confusion is that they never saw their parents or grandparents pay taxes on their benefits. However, more and more retirees are likely to pay taxes on their benefits going forward. As of 2022, approximately 48% of Social Security recipients were paying federal income taxes on their benefits  a number thats expected to rise to around 56% by 2050, according to an analysis published by the Social Security Administration.Due to rule changes first signed into law by President Ronald Reagan and later expanded by President Bill Clinton, Social Security recipients can face taxes on up to 85% of their benefits depending on their other sources of income. The formula for calculating the tax is called combined income or provisional income, and its not exactly simple.You can calculate your provisional or combined income by adding half of your annual Social Security benefits to your adjusted gross income (AGI), plus any nontaxable interest paid to you. From there, income brackets determine how much your benefits are considered taxable income.Less than $25,000 as a single filerLess than $32,000 as a joint filerBetween $25,000 and $34,000 as a single filerBetween $32,000 and $44,000 as a joint filerMore than $34,00 as a single filerMore than $44,000 as a joint filerFor example, say you receive $2,800 per month in Social Security in 2025, meaning youll collect $33,600 in total benefits for the year. Now, imagine that youll also withdraw $30,000 from an IRA. As a result, your provisional income would be $46,800 ($16,800 + $30,000). As a single tax-filer, you would be taxed on up to 85% of your benefits since your provisional income exceeds the $34,000 threshold. According to this IRS calculator, youd pay income taxes on $15,380 of your benefits.Remember, a financial advisor can help you better understand your tax liability in retirement, including how much of your benefits will be taxable and strategies for mitigating these taxes.There are several strategies you can use to potentially minimize the taxes you end up paying on your Social Security benefits:Reduce or delay retirement withdrawals: Postponing or reducing withdrawals from an IRA, 401(k) or other tax-deferred account lowers or eliminates your provisional income. One strategy would be to withdraw cash from a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), which doesnt count as taxable income.Manage your RMDs: At age 73 (or 75 for those who turn 74 after Dec. 31, 2032), the IRS requires you to start taking required minimum distributions (RMD) from your IRAs, 401(k)s and other tax-deferred accounts. If youre still working and have a 401(k) at that workplace, you arent required to take RMDs from that account. If you make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) from an IRA, that amount can help satisfy your RMD but wont count as taxable income.Roth conversion: Converting an IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA means youll pay income tax at the time of conversion but qualified withdrawals in the future can be made tax-free and wont count toward your combined income. However, you will likely face taxes on your Social Security benefits in the year that you convert any tax-deferred assets. One strategy is to convert just enough money to keep your taxable Social Security benefits to 50% or 0%.Watch out for the tax torpedo: Be aware that when the taxable amount of your benefits is added to your income, it could push you into a higher tax bracket. This impact is known as the Social Security tax torpedo. Remember to consider all of your retirement income sources when it comes to tax planning. A financial advisor can also help you avoid this tax torpedo and other financial pitfalls of retirement.How to manage and minimize the taxes you pay on your Social Security benefits and other retirement income can be complicated. Take the time to estimate your retirement taxes before you start collecting pensions, Social Security and taking withdrawals from retirement accounts.Its important to understand how required minimum distributions (RMDs) work and how they can impact your tax liability in retirement. These mandatory withdrawals from tax-deferred retirement accounts add to your taxable income and potentially push you into a higher tax bracket. Luckily, SmartAsset has an RMD calculator to help you estimate how much your first RMD may be and when it will be due so that you can plan ahead.Balancing taxes and retirement income is an important element of financial planning in retirement. A knowledgeable financial advisor can help you decide how to structure and coordinate your income plan to potentially minimize taxes. Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard.

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. A bear call spread is an options strategy where you sell a call option at one strike price and buy another at a higher strike price for the same stock and expiration. This approach caps both potential profit and loss, and provides upfront credit. Traders use this method when they expect the stock price to stay below the lower strike price at expiration, typically in bearish or stable market conditions. A financial advisor can help you determine how this strategy, and other investment strategies, could fit into your portfolio.A bear call spread is an options trading strategy used when traders expect a moderate decline in a stock's price. It may be appropriate when a trader expects a stock to stay below a certain level but does not anticipate a sharp decline.The bear call spread is often employed in neutral to mildly bearish market conditions where the goal is to collect premium income rather than profit from a significant price drop. Since the strategy benefits from time decay, it can also be useful in markets with low volatility.This strategy involves selling a call option at a lower strike price while simultaneously buying another call option with the same expiration date at a higher strike price. A bear call spread generates an upfront credit, which represents the maximum profit a trader can earn if the stock price remains below the lower strike price at expiration.The sold call option carries a higher premium since it has a lower strike price, while the purchased call option costs less because it has a higher strike price. The difference between the two premiums creates the net credit received.The best-case scenario is when the stock price remains below the lower strike price at expiration and both options expire worthless. This allows the trader to keep the entire credit as profit.The maximum profit is limited to the initial credit received when opening the trade. However, the potential loss is also capped. The maximum loss is equal to the difference between the strike prices, minus the credit received. It is realized if the stock price rises above the higher strike price at expiration. The defined risk makes the strategy appealing to traders who want a bearish position with limited downside risk.Consider an investor who believes the stock of Company A, currently trading at $50, will remain below $55 over the next month. They sell a call option with a $50 strike price for $3 per contract and buy a call option with a $55 strike price for $1 per contract. This results in a net credit of $2 per contract, or $200 for one standard options contract representing 100 shares.The maximum profit for this trade is the net credit of $200. This happens if Company A's stock remains at or below $50 at expiration, causing both options to expire worthless.The maximum loss occurs if the stock rises above $55, leading to a $5 loss per share minus the $2 credit, totaling $300 per contract. The breakeven point is $52, calculated by adding the $2 net credit to the lower strike price. If the price rises toward that breakeven point, the trader may choose to close the spread early to limit losses.Because a bear call spread limits potential losses, it can offer a relatively safe way to trade on the expectation of price declines. For example, selling naked calls is another way to trade on bearish sentiment, but they carry unlimited risk if the underlying asset rises sharply.Bear call spreads also require less capital than some other bearish options strategies. The margin requirement is lower compared to shorting a stock or selling uncovered calls, making it more accessible for traders with limited capital. This lower entry cost allows traders to take advantage of bearish opportunities without tying up significant funds.However, while this strategy limits risk, it also limits upside. The maximum profit is restricted to the net premium received when entering the trade. Even if the underlying asset drops significantly, traders cannot earn more than the initial premium. That makes this strategy less attractive for those seeking large gains from bearish movements.Bear call spreads work best in flat or slightly declining markets. If the underlying asset remains flat or decreases slightly, traders can profit. However, if the decline happens too slowly or the asset rises instead, the strategy can fail. Because timing is a key factor, traders analyze trends and volatility carefully before execution.Additionally, if the underlying asset rises above the bought call's strike price, traders can face a loss. While the loss is capped, it can still be substantial if the difference between the strike prices is wide.Another strategy called a bear put spread involves buying a put option at a higher strike price while selling another put option at a lower strike price. Unlike the bear call spread, this requires an initial investment, known as a debit, since the cost of purchasing the higher strike put exceeds the premium received from selling the lower strike put.The primary difference between these strategies lies in cost and risk exposure. A bear put spread requires an upfront cost but offers a clearly defined maximum loss. A bear call spread provides an initial credit but carries the risk of larger potential losses if the asset rises unexpectedly.While both aim to profit from declining prices, a bear put spread benefits more from significant downward movement. Conversely, a bear call spread works best in a market that trends slightly downward or remains stable.A bear call spread strategy can generate income in a bearish market while limiting risk. It can be particularly useful when stock prices are expected to decline or remain stagnant. While losses are limited, they can still be significant if the stock price rises above the breakeven point. Because the maximum profit is capped at the net premium received, the potential reward may not justify the risk for some traders. Market timing and volatility play key roles in the strategys effectiveness.A financial advisor can help you analyze investments and manage risk for your portfolio.

A bull call spread is an options strategy used to profit from moderate increases in the underlying assets price while limiting risk. It involves buying a call option at a lower strike price and selling another at a higher strike price, both expiring on the same date. The cost to enter this trade is the difference between the two option premiums, which is also the maximum loss. This method is popular for maintaining a balanced risk-reward ratio in bullish markets.A financial advisor can help you set up a bull call spread strategy, or any other investment strategy, to match different investment goals.A bull call spread is an options trading strategy designed to profit from moderate increases in the price of an underlying asset. Known also as a long call spread or debit call spread, its called a debit spread because traders must pay to establish the position.The strategy involves using two call options: buying one call option at a lower strike price and selling another at a higher strike price. Both options expire on the same date but have different strike prices, which creates a spread. This spread limits both potential profit and loss.When setting up this spread, traders reduce their initial cost by selling a call option at a higher strike price, which offsets the price of the call they buy. The difference in premiums between the two options is the total cost, which is the most they can lose, but it also limits their maximum possible profit.A bull call spread seeks to create a balanced risk-reward profile. This strategy is designed for situations where a trader expects a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset but wants to manage costs and limit potential losses.To see how it might work, suppose a stock is trading at $100 per share. A trader believes the stock will rise to $110 but not much higher within the next month. In this situation, with moderately bullish expectations, a bull call spread is often the strategy of choice.To execute a bull call spread, the trader might buy a call option with a $100 strike price for $5 and sell a call option with a $110 strike price for $2. The net cost of this spread is $3 ($5  $2), which is also the maximum potential loss.The breakeven point is calculated by adding the net cost of the spread to the lower strike price. In this example, the breakeven price is $103 ($100 + $3). For the trade to be profitable, the stock must rise above this level before the options expire.The maximum profit is capped at the difference between the two strike prices minus the net cost of the spread. In this case, the difference in strike prices is $10 ($110  $100), and the net cost is $3, so the maximum profit is $7 per share ($10  $3). This profit is achieved if the stock price rises to or above the higher strike price ($110) by expiration.Using a bull call spread begins with identifying a moderately bullish market scenario. Traders should choose an underlying asset, such as a stock, they expect to increase in value but remain within a predictable range over a selected period of time. Here are six steps to help you use this strategy:Analyze market conditions: Assess the current market environment and determine if the underlying asset is likely to experience a moderate price increase. You may use technical analysis, fundamental research or market trends to support your outlook.Select strike prices: Choose a lower strike price that is near the current trading price of the asset and a higher strike price representing the target price range. The difference between these strike prices will influence the cost and profit potential of the spread.Determine expiration date: Select an expiration date that aligns with your anticipated price movement. Aim to give the asset enough time to reach the desired price range.Calculate costs and risks: Before entering the trade, calculate the net cost of the spread by subtracting the premium received for selling the higher strike call from the premium paid for the lower strike call. This amount represents your maximum potential loss.Monitor the trade: Once the position is established, monitor the underlying assets price movement. If the price approaches or exceeds the higher strike price before expiration, you'll achieve maximum profit. If it falls below the lower strike price, the trade will result in the maximum loss.Close the position if needed: You can exit the spread early by closing both legs of the trade. This can be useful if the asset's price moves unexpectedly or if you want to lock in partial profits.While a bull call spread offers defined risk and cost efficiency, its limitations can make it less suitable for certain scenarios. One key drawback is the capped profit potential, which limits gains even if the underlying asset's price significantly exceeds the higher strike price.Additionally, the strategy requires precise market timing. If the asset does not reach the expected price range within the set time frame, the options may expire worthless.Another limitation is the impact of transaction costs. The costs include the premium paid for the lower strike call option contract as well as commissions and other fees. These can reduce overall profitability, and the effect may be particularly pronounced for smaller trades.Lastly, a bull call spread is less effective in highly volatile markets. When prices are moving rapidly, it may be more desirable to avoid capping profit and instead use other strategies.The bull call spread lets traders take advantage of moderately bullish markets with controlled risk. This strategy uses two call options to balance potential profits with predetermined losses. However, it does limit the maximum profit and is sensitive to market timing, requiring careful planning and a clear understanding of the market. Its ideal for traders who prefer predictable outcomes and are okay with moderate returns for lower risk.A financial advisor can help you mitigate risk for your portfolio.

        "content": "The Construction MMI (Monthly Metals Index) held its sideways trend, budging down a slight 1.35%. Meanwhile, the U.S. construction industry faces a complex landscape shaped by recent policy changes, Trump tariffs and other economic factors.Steel remains a fundamental component of modern construction, playing a crucial role in buildings, bridges and infrastructure. Key materials such as H-beam steel and steel rebar provide essential strength and reinforcement for dozens of types of projects. But with a newly imposed 10% tariff on Chinese steel imports, contractors and developers will likely experience some price increases.In 2024, Chinas steel exports climbed to 110.72 million metric tons, reflecting a 22.7% rise from the prior year. This surge largely stemmed from declining domestic demand, which prompted Chinese manufacturers to offload surplus steel into global markets. As a result, international steelmakers faced mounting pressure to lower their prices in order to compete.Much of Chinas exported steel comprises construction-focused materials, including H-beam steel and steel rebar. With the enforcement of the 10% tariff on Chinese steel and the possibility of an even steeper 25% tariff on all steel imports, procuring these materials from China is becoming less financially viable.As the price of imported steel and aluminum rises due to the Trump tariffs, the construction industry is bracing for potential financial strain. Many firms argue that higher costs may lead to project delays, scaled-down developments or increased expenses that will ultimately be passed on to end-users.Small business owners across the construction sector, who are already grappling with tight profit margins due to persistently high interest rates, worry that these tariffs could exacerbate their financial difficulties.Despite the immediate challenges, some industry experts argue that these tariffs could benefit the domestic steel and aluminum sectors in the long term. By making foreign materials more expensive, policymakers aim to promote domestic production, potentially fostering increased investment in U.S. manufacturing and creating new jobs in these industries.For instance, the construction industry saw substantial price increases during the COVID-19 pandemic due to labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and increased demand. In addition to this, materials like steel and lumber saw price increases during the pandemic that were far higher than anticipated price increases under the new tariffs.According to this historical comparison, tariffs may have a more predictable and controllable effect than the market instability that occurred during the pandemic, even though the current Trump tariffs will still raise expenses.Industry organizations urge construction firms to be proactive in navigating these pricing fluctuations. The Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors National Association (SMACNA) recently advised companies to adjust contracts in anticipation of cost increases and to explore domestic sourcing options where practical.Price changes in the aluminum industry since aluminum tariffs were announced by the Trump Administration.

        "content": "For years, I ran my own business, and right around this time of year, I would get whipped up trying to pick mutual funds for my Individual Retirement Account (IRA).As the April 15 tax filing deadline drew near, my accountant would shoot me the maximum amount I could contribute to my IRA based on my earnings, and then it was up to me to pick a winner, or a handful of them, to stash these retirement dollars.As I was sweating this out one day in March, a buddy who is a sharp wealth adviser suggested I invest the lot of it in a target-date retirement fund  or take a crack at putting my own target-date fund together.Im not someone you would call a do-it-yourselfer. I dont repaint bedrooms or refurnish antique tables I find at a flea market. But when it comes to my investments, I like feeling in control. Not to say that Im a voracious self-manager who relishes researching stocks and timing buys and sells. I invest, for the most part, in market-tracking index mutual funds balanced across stocks, such as the S&P 500 index, and fixed-income bond funds.In other words, Im a passive investor.That has worked for me. Index funds routinely clobber funds actively managed by professional stock pickers. And its why I set up my own custom target-date fund.You might want to give it a spin too. Heres how.Read more: Retirement planning: A step-by-step guideFirst, a recap of target-date funds.When 401(k) plan sponsors and state auto-IRA programs automatically enroll workers in a retirement plan, the majority use target-date funds. These funds are typically made up of a couple of index funds.You select the year youd like to retire and buy a mutual fund with that year in its name, like Target 2035. The fund manager then splits your investment between stocks and bonds, shifting to a more conservative mix as the target date nears.Its set-and-forget investing for what can stretch to decades and a boon for folks who want a hands-off approach.And for anyone who wants to be slightly more hands-on, its replicable.Step 1. Pick a date and research. I started by choosing my target date, in other words, the year I expected to retire. Then I researched target-date fund families to find a fund with the date I wanted.Some of the biggest target-date fund families include Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard, though most financial institutions offer them.Step 2. Check out the funds holdings. Find target-date funds from a few different firms that meet your year and see what percentage of the fund is in stocks, bonds, and cash, and which particular mutual funds the target-date fund invests in. These will be the guardrails for your selections.I found the target-date fund that matched my criteria at Vanguard. Its portfolio managers invest in four index funds, holding approximately 70% of assets in equities through a total stock market index fund and a total international stock index fund. The remaining 30% is invested in a total bond fund and a total international bond fund.The expense ratio: 0.08%. More on fees shortly.Truthfully, that was a little tame for me. But I knew I could add a pinch more to my equity portion to align with my risk tolerance, or even add another equity index fund. Your allocations will depend on your target date, and the longer your time frame, the bigger the stock portion should be.The comparable target-date fund at Fidelity was a tad more aggressive than Vanguards. Its equity portion is 74%. Expense ratio: 0.69%. At T. Rowe Price, its target-date fund managers were a notch more conservative, with around 64% invested in stocks. Expense ratio: 0.56%.Step 3: Seek low expenses. You will discover that some target-date funds carry higher fees than the funds within them, and index target-date funds will be cheaper.That was one incentive for me to build my own personal target-date fund.It paid off: In total, my bespoke IRA account costs me 0.06% in fees, compared to 0.08% if I had invested via the actual target-date fund.Fees may seem a pocket-sized price to pay, but they cut into the amount you have invested and that has a significant impact on your future nest egg.Expense ratios typically vary by fund and reflect a variety of costs, including what a mutual fund or ETF pays for management advisory fees as well as the cost of marketing and selling the fund and other shareholder services, transfer-agent costs, and legal and accounting fees.In 2023, index equity mutual funds had an asset-weighted average expense ratio of 0.05%, or just $5 for every $10,000 invested, according to research by the Investment Company Institute.Compare that to 0.42%, or $42 for every $10,000, for actively managed equity mutual funds.Target-date funds, however, are a tad pricer than a single equity index fund. Their fees reflect the asset-allocation monitoring by a fund manager on top of the fund expenses.The average net expense ratio for target-date funds is 0.84%, per Morningstar Directs most recent research.Vanguard currently has an average charge of 0.08% for its target-date funds. At Fidelity, the Fidelity Freedom target-date funds expense ratios run as high as 0.75%.That is far above the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares expense ratio of 0.04%. Or Fidelitys 500 Index Fund, which clocks in even lower at 0.015%.Step 4: Add your funds. Once you open your IRA account, you simply echo your chosen target-date funds asset allocation model by dividing your investment dollars among the same funds the target fund holds, using its stock/bond/cash percentages to steer you.You can then tweak the weighting of stock and bond funds to fit what feels comfortable to you.As you contribute money throughout the year or in a lump sum, the key is to maintain those same ratios.Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.Step 5. Rebalance your holdings periodically. Once a year  say, at tax time  youll want to check in on the funds within the target date youre imitating. Then, if your overall portfolio balance has changed because one of the funds has leapt up or fallen down, you can fine-tune your DIY holdings to get back to the level you want.Financial advisers usually recommend rebalancing (adjusting your mix of stocks and bonds) whenever your portfolio gets more than 7% to 10% away from your original asset allocation, which was constructed to match your time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals.Every time I log in to my account, I can see precisely where the asset allocation stands. Ive made adjustments, but to be honest, even after a nerve-racking market slide. I typically sit on my hands. To me, this is bumper bowling.With the mutual fund pros selections as my guide, I feel secure that I wont dart into the gutter even when stocks slump.Kerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "As a new parent, there are many details to plan for. Yet saving for your childs future is an important financial responsibility that you may want to start preparing for sooner rather than later.The good news is there are many options available for starting a savings fund for your baby. And even if you only have the ability to put away a few extra dollars each month, making a consistent habit of saving for your child could produce big benefits over time.This embedded content is not available in your region.When youre ready to begin saving cash for your babys future, you may want to consider setting up a designated, separate account to hold the money. The best savings funds for babies and children feature above-average returns, low fees, and potential tax benefits.Heres a look at four smart ways to start a savings fund for a baby, depending on your goals.Opening a savings account for your baby can be an easy, low-risk way to stash away cash for your childs future. So, if you plan to open a savings account for a child, you may want to consider whether a high-yield savings account (HYSA) might be a good fit for your goals.High-yield savings accounts are deposit accounts that typically offer above-average interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts  as much as 10 times the national average. And if you open a HYSA with an FDIC-insured bank, you can trust that your deposits are safe (up to $250,000 per depositor, per account ownership category).One downside: High-yield savings accounts come with variable interest rates that can go up and down with market conditions. Plus, despite competitive rates compared to other types of deposit accounts, they still dont match the returns you can achieve by investing in the market.High-yield savings accounts are commonly found at online banks, but you should also check with traditional banks and credit unions. Its wise to compare multiple HYSA account options to make sure you find the best rates and account terms available.Read more: The 10 best high-yield savings accounts available todayAnother way to save money for your baby is to open a custodial account. These types of accounts allow you to save and invest money on your childs behalf.Custodial accounts come in the following two main varieties:Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) accounts: UGMA accounts can hold cash and financial investments. You can open these accounts on behalf of a minor family member in all 50 states.Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts: UTMA accounts can hold cash, financial investments, real estate, and other types of property. You can open these accounts on behalf of a minor family member, but they're not available in all 50 states.These custodial accounts have no annual contribution limits, but the IRS does impose a gift tax if you deposit over a certain threshold. The federal gift tax limit for 2025 is $19,000 per individual and $38,000 per married couple.Gifting a certificate of deposit (CD) is another option to consider if youre looking for ways to invest money for your babys future. A CD can be appealing because it offers a fixed interest rate for the entire term (which can range from a few months to several years), which can be particularly beneficial in a falling interest rate environment.The catch is that you must keep the money you deposit in a CD in the account until it reaches maturity. Otherwise, youll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty.If you want to gift a certificate of deposit to your child, you first need to open the CD as a custodial account  either a UTMA or UGMA (see above). This means your child wont own the CD, at least not until they reach adulthood. And since the age of adulthood varies on a state-by-state basis, the process of transferring the CD to your child once theyre old enough can differ.With a UGMA account, your child would need to withdraw the cash from their CD between the ages of 18 and 21 (depending on the state of residence). A UTMA account, by comparison, lets you, as a parent, make withdrawals for the benefit of your child at any time. Once your child (aka the beneficiary) reaches adulthood (18 to 21, depending on the state of residence), they can take control of the CD.Read more: Can you gift a certificate of deposit?As a parent, one of the biggest expenses you may need to plan for when it comes to your child is their college education. A 529 plan could be a great tool to help you accomplish that goal.A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged, flexible savings plan you can use to pay for educational expenses. Parents, grandparents, and other family members can contribute to the 529 plan as well. Plus, you can invest the money in potentially high-return stock funds on behalf of your child, who is the beneficiary. Additionally, as long as the beneficiary uses the money for qualified educational expenses, they wont have to pay taxes on any gains.You may even be able to open a 529 plan for an unborn child if you want to start saving money early. Technically, you would name yourself as the beneficiary in this situation and list your baby as the beneficiary once they receive a Social Security number.Its also possible to change the beneficiary on 529 plans, giving parents more flexibility than some other savings products. But you should also consider the limitations of 529 plans (like the fact that you can only spend the money on educational expenses) before you open this type of account.Theres no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to saving money for your child. Depending on the financial goals you want to achieve, opening more than one type of savings fund for your baby might be the best option.Keep in mind that its also fine to ask for advice if youre not sure where to start. A trusted financial advisor can help you work through your financial priorities and create a financial plan that makes sense for your familyespecially when youre undergoing a major change like adding a new child to your household.Finally, remember that you dont have to start with a huge savings goal if doing so isnt affordable right now. Even if you can only afford to save a few extra dollars per month for your baby, creating the habit of saving is what matters most."

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. A trust indenture is a legal agreement between a bond issuer and a trustee, such as a bank, that outlines the terms of a bond issue. It details the issuers responsibilities, the rights of the bondholders and how the trustee monitors the issuers compliance. This document helps maintain transparency and protect investors from potential defaults. A financial advisor can help you understand whether you need a trust indenture for your investments.A trust indenture is a formal agreement that governs the issuance of bonds, acting as a binding contract between the bond issuer and a trustee who represents the interests of the bondholders. It includes comprehensive details about the bond, like its maturity date, interest payment schedule, redemption provisions and covenants.For example, a corporate bond issuance might include a trust indenture specifying that the issuer must maintain a certain debt-to-equity ratio and allocate specific funds for interest payments. The trustee makes sure that these covenants are followed and that bondholders are notified of any breaches. Without a trust indenture, bondholders may lack the necessary protections and recourse in case of issuer non-compliance.Trust indentures are typically prepared and reviewed during the bond issuance process to clarify the rights and obligations of all parties involved.A trust indenture legally enforces the terms of a bond and assigns a trustee to oversee compliance. The trustee serves as an intermediary between the issuer and the bondholders, helping to uphold the terms of the indenture.For example, when a municipality issues bonds to fund infrastructure projects, the trust indenture might specify that certain revenues be used to repay the bonds. The trustee then verifies that these revenues are properly allocated and keeps an eye on the issuers adherence to the indenture terms. If the issuer breaches any terms, the trustee can take legal action to protect the bondholders.Additionally, the trust indenture outlines key provisions such as:Redemption terms: Whether and under what conditions the bonds can be redeemed early.Default provisions: Actions to be taken if the issuer fails to make interest or principal payments.Collateral details: For secured bonds, the indenture specifies the assets pledged as collateral.Trust indentures are most commonly associated with certain types of bonds, particularly those regulated under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Here are some examples:Corporate bonds: Most corporate bonds have trust indentures to provide protections for bondholders and ensure compliance with agreed terms.Municipal bonds: While not all municipal bonds have trust indentures, revenue bonds often include them to define how project revenues will be managed and allocated.Mortgage-backed securities (MBS): These structured financial products typically use trust indentures to detail the handling of underlying mortgage payments and investor rights.Secured bonds: Trust indentures for secured bonds outline the collateral backing the bond and the rights of bondholders in case of default.In contrast, some bonds, such as U.S. Treasury securities, typically do not have trust indentures because they are considered low-risk and are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.When evaluating trust indentures in bond investing, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:Covenants: The indenture's covenants can significantly impact the issuer's flexibility and the bond's risk profile. Positive covenants, also known as affirmative covenants, require the issuer to take specific actions, such as maintaining insurance, while negative covenants restrict activities like taking on additional debt.Trustee role: The trustee's efficacy is critical to enforcing the terms of the trust indenture. Investors should consider the reputation and capabilities of the trustee.Default provisions: Understanding the default provisions in a trust indenture is crucial for assessing the risks of a bond investment. These provisions detail the steps bondholders can take in case of issuer default, such as initiating legal action or seizing collateral.Amendments and waivers: Some trust indentures include provisions for modifying terms or waiving certain covenants under specific conditions. These clauses can affect the bond's stability and the rights of bondholders.No, not all bonds have trust indentures. U.S. Treasury securities and certain municipal bonds, for example, often do not require trust indentures due to their low-risk nature.Yes, some trust indentures allow for amendments or waivers under specific conditions, usually requiring approval from a majority of bondholders. These changes can impact the bond's terms and risks.A trust indenture is an important document for bond for bondholders because it can offer transparency and protection by detailing the terms and conditions of a bond issuance. Whether you're investing in corporate bonds, municipal securities or other debt instruments, understanding the role and provisions of trust indentures can help you assess risks and make informed decisions.A financial advisor can help you analyze investments and mitigate risk for your portfolio.

        "content": "Car insurance provides crucial protections for motorists in the event of an accident or if their cars are stolen. Car insurance isnt just a good idea  its mandated by law in 48 states and Washington, D.C. To pay for that protection, you are charged a car insurance premium.The premium you pay for car insurance will vary depending on several factors. Heres what you need to know about how car insurance premiums are calculated to help you find the best deal. Well also explore ways you can save on your premium to keep more money in your pocket.Learn more: How does car insurance work? The basics explained.This embedded content is not available in your region.A car insurance premium is the amount you pay an insurance provider for a policy. Premiums are typically paid monthly, semi-annually, or annually. Although monthly payments offer the convenience of paying as you go, premiums that are paid semi-annually or annually usually cost less overall. Insurance providers often give discounts to policyholders who pay months in advance because it decreases the risk of late payments and cancellations.A car insurance policy will have a deductible, which is different from the premium. A deductible is the amount you must pay out-of-pocket before a policy will cover a claim.For example, if your vehicle is involved in an accident, you may be required to pay a $500 deductible before your policy will cover the remaining repair costs. Policies with higher deductibles are typically more affordable because the insurance company will pay less if you file a claim. A higher deductible also reduces the number of smaller claims made.Its easy to compare sticker prices when you are car shopping. However, what you pay for your car insurance premium isnt as straightforward because different factors can affect the cost  like your driving record, location, and credit score. The specific coverage you need  liability, personal injury protection, comprehensive, or collision  also plays a major role in the cost.Car insurance coverage typically starts with the minimum required by your state, with additional coverage added for extra protection. For example, if your state requires liability coverage, you could also add comprehensive and collision to ensure you're protected from damage to your vehicle, vandalism, theft, and other liabilities.Learn more: Most common types of car insurance explainedLiability coverage is usually the most affordable because it only covers bodily injury or property damage that you cause to others. It does not cover damage to your own vehicle. This type of coverage is required in 48 states. Only New Hampshire and Virginia do not require coverage.Personal injury protection (PIP) coverage is also known as no-fault insurance and is required in 12 states. It covers medical and other costs for you and your passengers, regardless of who is at fault in an accident. It does not cover damage to vehicles, property, or injuries to drivers in other vehicles.Comprehensive insurance covers certain types of damage, such as vandalism, theft, fire, hail, glass, and hitting an animal. However, it does not cover damage from a car accident or any other type of collision, medical expenses, or personal belongings.Collision insurance can be the most expensive because it pays for damage to your own vehicle after an accident, regardless of who is at fault. It does not cover non-collision damage, medical expenses, or damage to another driver's vehicle.One of the biggest factors affecting your car insurance premium is where you live due to variations in state laws, regulations, driving conditions, and other influences. Each state has its own minimum coverage requirement, and some mandate additional protections, like uninsured motorist coverage or PIP, which increases your premium.Car insurance rates vary significantly by state. For example, North Carolina offers some of the lowest rates, with one average annual premium estimate of $1,148, while Florida ranks among the most expensive, with one average annual premium estimate of $2,923 per year. Thats a staggering difference of over $1,700 based solely on ZIP code.Learn more: How does your ZIP code affect your car insurance?In addition to the coverage you select and where you live, additional factors can influence your car insurance premium  like your age, which is a big one. Zhaneta Gechev, insurance expert and founder of One Stop Life Insurance, explains how premiums change over time.Generally, the younger you are, the more expensive your car insurance will be. As you age, your insurance costs will decrease. You will notice a significant drop at 25, again around 50, and then once you are over 75, your premiums may start increasing again.Additional factors that affect car insurance premiums include:Deductible. Selecting a policy with a lower deductible may increase your premium because your insurer will have to pay more if you file a claim.Claims. In the eyes of the insurance company, filing a claim  even a small one  increases the risk of you filing future claims, which may result in a higher premium when you renew your policy.Traffic violations. The more traffic violations you have, the riskier you are to insure, which leads to higher premiums.Credit score. A lower credit score is an indicator of risk, which may increase your premium.Vehicle make, model, and year. Newer vehicles cost more to insure because they have higher replacement values. Certain vehicle brands and models are also more expensive to insure due to the risk of theft and higher repair costs. High-performance sports cars may also be driven more aggressively.Optional insurance add-ons. Emergency roadside assistance, accident forgiveness, rental car reimbursement, and other policy add-ons provide additional protections beyond standard coverage for an additional cost.If its been a few years since you last shopped for car insurance, it would be worth your time to compare costs. Insurance rates and needs change over time, and you may be able to find a better deal.Learn more: How to find cheap car insuranceHoward Goldberg, vice president of Customer Solutions at Plymouth Rock Assurance, highlights the value of shopping around and working with an expert.When comparing premiums between companies, make sure that youre using the same coverage limits and deductibles. This way, youll have a direct comparison between actual insurance products and a more accurate look at pricing. Talking to an independent agent is a great place to start since they can guide your decision-making based on their experience and by understanding your unique insurance needs. They can also help by providing you with quotes from multiple carriers and explaining the differences between each one.Many car insurance providers also offer discounts for military personnel, being a good student, having a safe driving record, and other factors. You may also qualify for a discount if you bundle your auto policy with your homeowners insurance or other types of insurance with the same provider. Its important to make sure you are taking advantage of all available discounts.Learn more: How to get all the best car insurance discountsAdjusting your deductible and avoiding unnecessary claims are additional ways you can save. A higher deductible typically decreases your premium because you will cover a higher percentage of the repair costs in an accident. Paying for minor repairs yourself may also reduce the number of claims you file.A premium is the amount you pay for your car insurance policy, while a quote is an estimate of what you might pay for car insurance with a provider. Obtaining a quote is a good way to compare costs to make sure you get the best deal, but it doesnt obligate you to purchase a policy.A policy term is the length of time your coverage is in effect and is either six months or one year. The rate you pay for your car insurance will not change during a policy term unless you make changes during a term. If you are in an accident or you experience a DUI, your premium will not change during the policy term. However, it may result in a premium increase when your policy renews.You cant negotiate your car insurance premium. However, you may still be able to save by making sure you are taking advantage of all available discounts. If you feel like you are paying too much with your current insurance provider, you can also shop around to see if another insurer offers better rates.This article was edited by Tim Manni."

Because a marriage is a complex legal partnership, its not as easy as looking at the name on a loan or account to determine who is responsible for marital debt. So whether youre entering a marriage, managing finances with a spouse, or preparing for a divorce, its important to know how marital debt works. A financial advisor can offer valuable guidance on handling shared debt, protecting your financial future and strategizing debt division during divorce proceedings.Marital debt includes any financial obligations acquired during the course of a marriage, regardless of whether the debt is in one spouse's name or both. The key factor in determining marital debt is whether the debt was accumulated during the marriage and was used for the benefit of the household or both partners. Generally, marital debt can include loans, credit card balances and other financial obligations used to support the couple's lifestyle, purchase shared assets or cover joint expenses.Marital debt typically includes different types of liabilities that are incurred during the lifetime of a marriage. Here are eight to keep in mind:Mortgage loans: If a couple purchases a home during the marriage, the mortgage is generally considered marital debt. Even if only one spouse's name is on the mortgage, both may still be responsible for it in a divorce. Courts often decide whether the home should be sold, refinanced or assigned to one spouse, with the other receiving compensation for their share.Credit card debt: It can be difficult to determine who is responsible for credit card debt in a divorce. Generally, household expenses, vacations, or shared purchases are considered marital debt. However, if one spouse racks up excessive debt on personal luxuries without the other's knowledge, courts may classify it as separate debt.Car loans: If a vehicle was purchased during the marriage, the associated loan is considered marital debt, even if only one spouses name is on the financing agreement. Courts may assign responsibility for the car loan based on who keeps the vehicle post-divorce.Medical debt: Many states consider medical expenses incurred during a marriage as joint debt, even if only one spouse received treatment. If a couple is divorcing, courts may divide medical debt based on who received treatment, financial circumstances and whether insurance covered part of the costs.Personal loans and lines of credit: Personal loans taken out during a marriage, such as those for home renovations, major purchases or debt consolidation, are often classified as marital debt. If a loan was used for household expenses or investments that benefited both spouses, it is typically shared in a divorce.Student loans: The treatment of student loans in a divorce varies. If the loans were taken out before the marriage, they are usually considered separate debt. However, if one spouse incurred student loans during the marriage and the funds contributed to household expenses, courts may classify the debt as partially or entirely marital.Business debt: If one spouse starts a business during the marriage and takes out loans or credit lines to fund it, the debt may be considered marital, especially if joint assets were used to support the business. However, courts may look at ownership structure, financial involvement, and whether the business benefited the household when deciding debt division.Tax debt: If a couple files joint tax returns, both spouses may be equally responsible for any tax liability, including unpaid taxes, penalties or interest. In some cases, innocent spouse relief may apply if one spouse was unaware of the other's financial misconduct.When a marriage ends, the division of debt can be as contentious as dividing assets. How marital debt is split depends largely on state laws and individual circumstances. Here are some laws, factors and options to consider.Community property states: In community property states like California, Texas and Arizona, marital debt is divided equally (50/50) between spouses, regardless of income or who incurred the debt.Equitable distribution states: In equitable distribution states, debt is divided fairly but not necessarily equally, meaning courts consider factors such as income, financial needs and purpose of the debt when determining responsibility.Who incurred the debt? If one spouse took on excessive debt without the other's knowledge, courts may assign responsibility to the spender.Who benefited from the debt? If both spouses benefited (e.g., a home loan, shared credit cards), the debt is likely divided between them.Financial ability to repay: Courts consider income, assets and earning potential when assigning debt responsibility.Prenuptial or postnuptial agreements: If a couple signed a legal agreement outlining debt division, courts typically enforce it.Debt repayment agreements: Some couples negotiate debt division outside of court, agreeing to split or assign debts based on financial capability.Refinancing loans: If one spouse keeps an asset (e.g., a house, car), they may refinance the loan in their name to remove the other spouse's responsibility.Selling assets to pay off debt: In some cases, selling marital assets (e.g., a home) allows couples to settle debts before finalizing the divorce.Marital debt is typically made up of financial obligations such as mortgages, credit cards and medical bills taken on during a marriage. The division of this debt in a divorce varies based on state laws and the couples financial situation, as well as who benefited from the debt.

This highlights the importance of shopping around for the best CD rates before opening an account.Online banks and neobanks are financial institutions that operate solely via the web. That means they have lower overhead costs than traditional brick and mortar banks.

If youre looking for the best CD rates available today, an online bank is a great place to start.However, online banks arent the only financial institutions offering competitive CD rates. Its also worth checking with credit unions. As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions return their profits to customers, who are also member-owners. Although many credit unions have strict membership requirements that are limited to those who belong to certain associations or work or live in certain areas, there are also several credit unions that just about anyone can join.Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on your savings goals. CDs are considered a safe and stable savings vehicle  they dont lose money (in most cases), are backed by federal insurance, and allow you to lock in todays best rates.However, there are some drawbacks to consider. First, you must keep your money on deposit for the full term, otherwise youll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you want flexible access to your funds, a high-yield savings account or money market account might be a better choice.Additionally, although todays CD rates are high by historical standards, they dont match the returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. If youre saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, a CD wont provide the growth you need to reach your savings goal within a reasonable time frame.Read more: Short- or long-term CD: Which is best for you?This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "Borrowers who got home loans through government-backed programs are increasingly falling behind on their payments, a potentially worrying signal for how lower-income Americans are faring in todays economy.Delinquency rates on Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs loans reached 11.03% and 4.7%, respectively, at the end of last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, breaching pre-pandemic levels.While FHA and VA loans dont have income restrictions, theyre insured by the government and have looser down payment and credit score requirements than conventional mortgages, making them popular among borrowers with dinged credit or lower incomes.Learn more: Types of FHA loans: Your options and how to choose a programConventional mortgage delinquencies are creeping up too, but much more slowly. At 2.62%, they remain below pre-pandemic levels and near historical lows. The divergence in that data likely reflects the extra economic pressures lower-income borrowers have faced in recent years, in particular high home prices, inflation, and the rapidly rising interest rates designed to address it.While the Fed is cutting rates, and thats helped lift asset prices a little bit, those on the lower-income household side are not feeling any benefit, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. Their borrowing costs are not going down. If anything, theyve been going up, and we still have sticky inflation thats eating into spending power.January Consumer Price Index data showed prices up 3% from a year earlier, well above the Federal Reserves 2% goal. The Fed cut interest rates three times in late 2024 amid signs that inflation was easing and the job market was weakening, but is now on pause as inflation shows signs of persistence. Traders are now expecting a single rate cut this year.Gradual rise in delinquencies on the way?The reasons consumers fall behind on their mortgages vary. About a quarter of FHA borrowers who were seriously delinquent  meaning they were more than three months behind on their payments  cited loss of income, followed by 19% who blamed excessive debt.Private mortgage lending to subprime borrowers all but dried up after the financial crisis, and FHA loans provide the closest proxy today. Even in the best economic times, delinquency rates on these loans are typically several times higher than on conventional loans.It is a very different borrower profile, said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research strategy at ICE Mortgage Technology. It was kind of expected that this would happen in this FHA section first because those are the borrowers that are typically impacted first when the broader economy changes. I think youll see a gradual rise in delinquencies outside of that.Higher-income consumers have fared well in recent years because they're more likely to have invested in the stock market and benefited from several strong years of gains, plus they spend a smaller portion of their incomes on essentials like groceries.But what starts as a stressor for less well-off borrowers can often spread, particularly if the job market weakens generally. In a recent report, ICE said FHA and VA loan delinquencies are likely to serve as canaries in the coal mine for broader mortgage payment trends during this economic cycle.Rikard Bandebo, chief economist for VantageScore, has been eyeing growing delinquencies among the high-income group his credit-scoring company tracks. Those earners, who make over $150,000 a year, are now falling behind on their mortgages, car loans, and credit cards at a relatively faster rate than households bringing in less than $45,000 annually.The costs of inflation are really beginning to hit them now, Bandebo said, adding that while this group might not have felt the sting of higher grocery costs, theyre still getting squeezed by ballooning expenses on things like car payments, insurance, and school tuition.Even as more consumers feel squeezed, todays delinquencies among all types of borrowers remain far below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic lockdowns of 2020.Were coming up off of a really low level, said Molly Boesel, senior principal economist at data provider CoreLogic.And homeowners are generally in a far better financial position than they were during the 2008 housing crisis  stricter mortgage underwriting and strong home price appreciation in recent years mean very few borrowers are underwater on their purchases.Still, Boesel said shes monitoring where in the country borrowers are paying late. CoreLogic found that delinquencies are rising in 80% of metro areas, suggesting a more widespread problem that cant be explained by single destabilizing events like natural disasters.Right now, exactly when a borrower got their loan also matters. Those who purchased in 2021 or earlier, when mortgage rates were near all-time lows and home prices hadnt yet hockey-sticked higher, have much lower debt-to-income ratios and healthier equity positions than those who bought in 2022 or 2023, said Walden, of ICE.Read more: How do you qualify for a home equity loan?Given how much harder its become to afford a home, recent borrowers are going delinquent early in their loans at higher rates than those who bought a few years earlier, even though underwriting standards havent changed. Higher prices and mortgage rates also mean they build equity at a slower pace.Its a night-and-day difference, Walden said.

However, youre usually allowed to \"bump up\" your rate just once.No-penalty CD: Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.Jumbo CD: These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In todays CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.Brokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.This embedded content is not available in your region."

It also shows how the home price and down payment amount play into things.Our calculator includes homeowners insurance and property taxes in your monthly payment estimate. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.There are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because youre spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isnt going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.The main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest  both in the short and long term.A 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and its higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. Youll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.The pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, youll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So youll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.However, because youre paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.Dig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgagesAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.The main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what youll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though  in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)With an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.But if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.Learn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgageFirst of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to the last couple of years. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current climate.Also, mortgage rates aren't predicted to fall drastically throughout 2025 like people were expecting a few months ago. So, now could be just as good a time to buy as in a couple of months from now.Also, the best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market  buy when it's the right time for you.Read more: Which is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?According to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.53% right now, after gradually falling for a full week. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.Mortgage rates are expected to go down overall in 2025, though they probably won't significantly drop anytime soon.Mortgage rates haven't necessarily been dropping  they've been inching up and down. But most rates have fallen a little more than usual today.In many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher."

As a result, deposit interest rates are falling from their historic highs.Still, it's possible to find high-yield savings accounts paying above 4% APY. So, if youre looking for the best rates available today, heres a breakdown of where to find them.Although savings interest rates are elevated by historical standards, the national average rate for savings accounts is still just 0.41%, according to the FDIC. The good news: Top high-yield savings accounts offer more than 10 times the national average.As of February 14, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners today is 4.50% APY.

Interest rates vary widely, but there are several banks (in particular, online banks) and credit unions with highly competitive offers.Related: 10 best high-yield savings accounts>>Online banks operate exclusively via the web. This significantly reduces their overhead costs, so theyre able to pass those savings onto customers in the form of high deposit rates and low fees. In fact, many of the best high-yield savings accounts also come with zero monthly fees or minimum opening deposit requirements. If youre searching for the best savings interest rates, online banks are a great place to start.That said, online banks arent the only place you can find savings accounts with rates that range between 4% and 5% APY. Credit unions are not-for-profit financial cooperatives and are also known for providing competitive rates and fewer fees. Many credit unions have certain requirements that must be met in order to become a member, though there are some that allow just about anyone to join.Read more: Heres why online banks offer the highest savings interest ratesSavings accounts are one of the safest places you can put your money. Theyre insured by the FDIC (or the NCUA in the case of credit unions), which means your deposits are protected up to $250,000 if your financial institution fails. They also cant lose money due to market fluctuations.However, a savings account isnt always the right choice. Although todays savings interest rates are high by historical standards, they still dont offer the same returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. For long-term savings goals such as retirement, you need to invest a bulk of your savings in higher risk (but higher reward) market investments such as stocks, index funds, and mutual funds to reach your target.But if youre saving for a shorter-term goal such as a down payment on a home, vacation, or even an emergency fund, a high-yield savings account is one of the best options. Thats especially true if you want to access your money as needed; other types of high-yield deposit accounts, including money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) place more restrictions on how often you can make withdrawals.This embedded content is not available in your region."

However, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM rates have similar to (or even higher than) 30-year fixed rates recently.

        "content": "By Elizabeth HowcroftPARIS (Reuters) - Fake news generated by artificial intelligence and spread on social media is heightening the risks of bank runs, according to a new British study that says lenders must improve monitoring to detect when disinformation risks impacting customer behaviour.Generative AI can be used to create fake news stories saying that customer money is not safe, or memes appearing to joke about security issues, which can be spread on social media using paid adverts, said the study, published by UK research company Say No to Disinfo and communications firm Fenimore Harper.Banks and regulators are increasingly concerned about the risks of bank runs fuelled by social media, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, in which depositors withdrew $42 billion in 24 hours.Advances in AI have supercharged these risks. The G20's Financial Stability Board warned in November that generative AI \"could enable malicious actors to generate and spread disinformation that causes acute crises\", including flash crashes and bank runs.Say No to Disinfo showed sample AI-generated content to UK bank customers and found that a third were \"extremely likely\" to move their money after seeing it, with a further 27% \"somewhat likely\".\"As AI is making disinformation campaigns easier, cheaper, quicker and more effective than ever before, the emerging risk to the financial sector is rapidly growing but often overlooked,\" the report said, noting that online and mobile banking meant people can move money in seconds.The study estimated that for every 10 pounds ($12.48) spent on social media adverts to amplify the fake content, as much as 1 million pounds of customer deposits could be moved.The estimate was calculated by using average deposits held by UK customers, the cost of social media adverts, and estimates for how many people would see them.Banks need to monitor media and social media mentions, and such monitoring must be integrated with withdrawal monitoring systems to identify when malicious information is affecting customer behaviour, the researchers said.Asked about the study, Revolut's head of financial crime, Woody Malouf, said the London-based fintech conducts real-time monitoring for emerging threats among its customers and \"across the broader ecosystem\".\"Whilst we believe an industry event like this is unlikely, it is still possible, so it's essential that financial institutions are prepared,\" he said, adding that social media platforms must play a bigger role in stopping threats.Other financial institutions contacted by Reuters, including NatWest and Barclays, declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.While regulators have expressed concern about AI's overall impact on financial stability, banks are broadly optimistic about the technology's impact.\"Banks are working hard to manage and mitigate risks around AI and the regulatory authorities are looking at the potential financial stability challenges the technology poses,\" industry body UK Finance said.The report's release was unrelated to an AI Summit in France this week, at which politicians and industry executives focused on promoting the spread of AI, a marked shift from the previous summit's focus on managing its risks.($1 = 0.8013 pounds)(Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft in Paris; Editing by Tommy Reggiori Wilkes and David Gregorio)"

        "content": "As the president and CEO of IHG Hotels & Resorts, Elie Maalouf has his hands on the levers of an industry being reshaped by technology, loyalty economics, and the gravitational pull of big brands.Theres always been a mix of local and global in hospitality, but the game has changed, Maalouf said. Today, the regional players that want to go further need access to capital, technology, and distribution networks that only global brands can provide.One clear example is IHG's April 2024 deal with Novum Hospitality. A homegrown German group decided it made more sense to hitch its future to IHG than to go it alone with its own brands.That decisionturning over 119 properties for franchising to the IHG machinetells a bigger story about whats happening across Europes fiercely independent hospitality scene.A year and a half into the role, Maalouf sat down with Skift for an exclusive interview at the Americas Lodging Investment Summit (ALIS) in Los Angeles. The CEO covered the dynamics he sees driving more independents to IHG, how tech investments could give IHG a competitive edge, and why he's excited about Japan's potential for hotel development (from midscale to luxury).Europe is a key market for a global hotel group like IHG. Only about 40% of hotel inventory there is branded, according to CoStar's STR.We see tremendous opportunity for growth in Europe, where independent hotels and regional chains are realizing that competing in todays digital landscape is incredibly expensive, Maalouf said.Rather than trying to buy IHG's way in with hard assets, the group is relying on a franchise-heavy model that emphasizes conversions, such as the Novum deal.Novum's decision wasn't just about gaining access to IHG's global distribution network. It was also about tapping into a technological ecosystem that would have been prohibitively expensive to build independently.In other words, Europe's hotel landscape requires massive investment in digital infrastructure. \"It's the kind of investment that's becoming increasingly difficult for regional hotel groups to shoulder alone,\" Maalouf said.\"How you interact with the travel experience from beginning to end is now very digital,\" Maalouf explained. \"You expect to research and book digitally. You expect to be able to check in and out digitally, to ask for services in the hotel digitally, and so on.\"Software investment is one of the ways IHG has sought to be an attractive partner for independent hotel owners who are feeling the squeeze of rising tech costs and changing consumer expectations.Its multi-year shift to a cloud-based Amadeus-run central reservation system was well-documented pre-pandemic. Since then, the hotel group has continued revamping its tech stack.Worldwide, IHG has rolled out what Maalouf calls the \"industry's leading guest reservation system.\" The software lets all its hotels sell rooms as well as specific \"attributes\"  floors, views, experiences  before a guest even walks through the lobby.Maalouf said it has been rolling out AI-driven systems that flag potential guest issues and provide real-time assessment of guest feedback before they become Tripadvisor fodder.If you wait for a survey after checkout, youve already lost your chance to turn a stay around, he said. The key is fixing problems while the guest is still in-house.A new AI-powered revenue management system, already deployed in nearly 3,500 properties, helps optimize pricing in real-time. The company has even re-platformed its content management system to enable multi-language translation and rich-media content delivery.IHG has also been nudging franchisees toward renovations by offering data on what updates will have the biggest impact on guest satisfaction and revenue.Maintaining consistent quality across properties is crucial for a company hosting approximately one million guests per night.\"Even if we're 99.9% precise in delivering customer service, that's still a thousand people that weren't exactly satisfied,\" Maalouf notes.In China, IHG is even experimenting with robots in hundreds of its hotels by using them for towel and drink delivery. Maalouf was quick to position this as a practical solution to labor shortages.IHG One Rewards, the company's loyalty program, is another pillar of Maaloufs vision. When he took over, IHG had fallen behind competitors in the points wars.Skift noted that, a decade ago, IHG had the most members in a loyalty program of any group, but since then (and before Maalouf's tenure) had fallen to third place after Marriott and Hilton. As of late 2024, the company was on track to have approximately 145 million members by year-end, while Marriott and Hilton each had over 200 million.\"What really matters is the number of members per room,\" Maalouf said. \"Some hotel companies have fewer rooms than we do. Some companies have more rooms. For fair comparisons, you have to look at the proportion of members per room. On that, IHG One Rewards is right up there with everybody and growing quickly.\"What also matters isnt just how many members you haveits how many of them actually stay with you, the CEO said.Nearly 70% of IHGs room nights in \"the Americas\" now come from loyalty members, up 10 percentage points from 2019. (Globally, the figure is 60%.) The levels are roughly comparable to what its peer companies report. The proportion is important. Direct bookings by loyalty members avoid the commissions that online travel agencies charge.According to Maalouf, IHG's loyalty program's recent membership gains are owed to personalization powered by tech. The program lets guests tweak their perks in a way that others don't.The renewal this year of IHGs credit card deals with JPMorgan Chase, set to run through 2036, cements the strategy. Credit card fees recognized within IHGs operating profit will more than triple by 2028, IHG said.IHGs growth engine isnt all high-thread-count luxury. Among its 19 brands, Holiday Inn Express remains the companys golden goose. The brand has conquered the upper-midscale segment with ruthless efficiency. With over 3,200 hotels worldwide, its a reliable, no-frills bet for travelers and a moneymaker for franchisees.Its a brand that resonates across markets because it delivers a consistent, high-quality experience at a price point that works, Maalouf said.That said, IHGs luxury and lifestyle brands have surged in prominence, accounting for 20% of the group's pipelinenearly double what it was five years ago. The companys Six Senses, Regent, and Kimpton brands continue to set a high bar, with new projects in sought-after destinations like Santa Monica, Telluride, and the Maldives.Regent Santa Monica Beach, with its high-end dining and oceanfront spa, is a prime example of IHGs push into the ultra-luxury space, Maalouf said.Meanwhile, Six Senses is expanding in the Americas and Europe, capitalizing on growing demand for sustainable, experience-driven luxury.Weve doubled down on luxury and lifestyle, knowing that guests today want more than just a hotelthey want a full-scale immersive experience, Maalouf said.Exhibit A: If the U.S. is IHGs biggest market playground, Japan is a sleeping giant for expansion. The countrys hotel industry has been historically independent, with only a very small percentage of its total inventory tied to global brands.However, international travel to Japan is booming40 million visitors last year, with a target of 60 million. So, Maalouf sees a major opportunity to introduce IHG brands into the mix.Japan has been a domestic-driven market for a long time, but thats changing, Maalouf said. Theres a ton of room for branded growth, and were ready to bring our solutions to the table.The company recently expanded its Garner brand into Japan, tapping into a midscale niche that international players have underserved.Maalouf starts his days at 5am with a workout (twice-weekly outdoor runs when his schedule permits). He joked that health maintenance is much like brand management  consistency is key.Running IHG is no desk job, so he tries to exercise even while on the road. In recent weeks, he has traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Singapore, inspecting properties, meeting with regional teams, and speaking at events.Maalouf said he's still learning, given that he has only been in the hotel industry for a decade. He previously worked at Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company and as an advisor with McKinsey.\"I learn something every day in this business  multiple things a day,\" Maalouf reflected. \"It's just something to learn from our colleagues, from owners, from journalists. And I get a lot of life and stimulation from it  the process of getting to know everything in this business.\"Maalouf's goal for IHG is similar. He expects his team to evolve in response to the latest trends and intelligence.Our job is to create long-term valuefor guests, for owners, and for our partners, Maalouf said. The industry is changing, and we plan to lead that change.

        "content": "By Karen BrettellNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar jumped to a one-week high against the Japanese yen on Wednesday after data showed that consumer prices rose more than economists expected in January, raising the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates higher for longer as it battles to bring down price pressures.U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years, with Americans facing higher costs for a range of goods and services.The headline consumer price index rose by 0.5% in January, while the core index rose by 0.4%. Both were expected to rise by 0.3%.That puts headline consumer price gains at 3.0% for the year, above expectations for a 2.9% increase, while core prices rose at an annual pace of 3.3%, above expectations for a 3.1% rise.\"The takeaway is no matter what the reason was for the upside surprise, the Fed has been very clear that it won't cut rates until inflation is close to 2%,\" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive in Toronto.\"Whether it's one-offs due to eggs or the fire in California, the prospect of hitting 2% inflation this year when we start the year with 0.5% is greatly diminished, Button said.Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in 27 basis points of cuts by December, down from around 37 basis points before the data, implying a larger chance of only one 25-basis-point cut for the year.The dollar jumped 1.29% to 154.44 Japanese yen. The Japanese currency is highly sensitive to the interest rate gap between the United States and Japan.The dollar index was last up 0.02% on the day at 107.95, after earlier reaching a one-week high of 108.52.The greenback pared gains as traders took profits and evaluated whether January's inflation report was an anomaly and unlikely to signal a larger trend towards higher prices.\"January is a tricky month because a lot of annual price increases are announced for all sorts of things, and sometimes they are chunky,\" Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, said in a note. \"We are not inclined to expect a repeat next month.\"Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday repeated that the central bank is in no rush to cut interest rates during a second congressional hearing this week, but said that there has been \"great progress\" on inflation.The euro was also boosted after Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said the European Central Bank should ease policy only gradually and not target a difficult-to-define \"neutral\" level for interest rates.The single currency was last was last up 0.27% at $1.0388.Meanwhile, traders are also focused on tariffs from the Donald Trump administration, which some analysts fear could add to price pressures if implemented.\"Potential tariffs add upside risk to inflation in coming quarters,\" James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note on Wednesday.\"But there are some encouraging signs that housing costs will slow meaningfully later in 2025 and keep the door open to the second half of the year cuts we are forecasting,\" he added.The Trump administration will announce reciprocal tariffs on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports by Thursday, the White House said.Trump is also planning to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 25% effective on March 4.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 0.80% to $97,162.44.(Reporting by Karen Brettell; Editing by Alex Richardson, Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Angus MacSwan and Nick Zieminski)"

        "content": "The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would tender central bank bills totalling 60 billion yuan (US$8.2 billion) in Hong Kong on Friday, marking the second time this year it has used the policy tool to stabilise the yuan amid tariff tensions with the US.The PBOC said it would tender 40 billion yuan in three-month bills and 20 billion yuan in one-year notes through the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on a fixed-rate, interest-bearing basis.The issuances aimed to \"enrich Hong Kong's high-credit-rating yuan financial products and improve Hong Kong's yuan yield curve\", the PBOC said as it unveiled the move on Wednesday.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.China's central bank has made a series of moves since January to support Hong Kong's status as a global hub for the offshore yuan, including a 100 billion yuan trade financing facility for banks and a new programme for offshore yuan repurchase agreements (repos).PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said last month that he would work with the HKMA, the city's de facto central bank, to encourage \"more high-quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in Hong Kong\", as well as issue yuan-denominated government bonds and central bank bills regularly.\"The issuance of yuan-denominated bills by PBOC, cleared through Hong Kong's CMU, enables international investors to access [mainland China's] government credit under market infrastructure governed by common law,\" said Terry Yang, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance. The Chinese government was using the city's unique features to enable continued international usage of the yuan, including the ability to use onshore Chinese bonds for collateral and repo-financing purposes, he added.PBOC issued 60 billion yuan worth of bills in Hong Kong last month. That offering was the largest-ever single issuance of offshore yuan bills tendered by the PBOC in the city and marked the first time it had issued bills in January. It was oversubscribed by 2.16 times.China was determined to prevent excessive depreciation pressure on the yuan, according to a senior Natixis economist. Photo: DPA alt=China was determined to prevent excessive depreciation pressure on the yuan, according to a senior Natixis economist. Photo: DPA>The PBOC has issued central bank bills several times when the yuan faced greater depreciation pressure to signal the stability of the exchange rate. Last year, it issued 12 offshore central bank bills in Hong Kong totalling 275 billion yuan, according to central bank data.\"China is determined to prevent excessive depreciation pressure amid an uncertain Federal Reserve rate path and geopolitical risks\", said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. \"However, it does not mean the yuan will not be allowed to depreciate, as long as its movement is in line with other non-dollar major currencies.\"US President Donald Trump applied an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese goods earlier this month, sending the yuan to record lows. The PBOC has adjusted its approach to setting the daily midpoint and issued offshore central bank bills to raise the cost of shorting the yuan.Meanwhile, China's Ministry of Finance planned to sell yuan-denominated bonds worth 12.5 billion yuan next week with tenors ranging from two to 30 years, according to an HKMA statement on Thursday.The yuan's prevailing interest rates had recently been lower than those of other major currencies, boosting the appeal of yuan financing, HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue Wai-man said in a blog post last week.In the first three quarters of 2024, issuance of yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong surged 35 per cent to HK$776.8 billion (US$99.7 billion), according to HKMA data.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

State Farm, for example, canceled thousands of policies in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles months before it was devastated by wildfires.Because mortgage lenders typically require homeowners insurance as a condition of making a loan, prospective buyers with few alternatives are increasingly purchasing coverage from state-designed insurers of last resort, which can have higher premiums and skimpier coverage than traditional alternatives.Banks and insurers wont keep making loans or providing coverage when faced with evidence of disasters, Powell said in response to a question from Minnesota Sen.

Theres a short-term problem that will go away in the coming years, but theres a longer-term problem with housing affordability, and thats going to be something thats not within our authorities or powers to affect, Powell said in response to a question from Sen. Ruben Gallego.Even if rates do fall, Powell said its not obvious that lower rates would slow housing inflation because demand would likely rise.It would unlock peoples low mortgages, but that creates both a buyer and a seller, Powell said. Its not clear that that would be something that would drive down housing inflation.When asked about the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Powell said that the governments backing of the mortgage giants does hold down mortgage rates. He said releasing them from conservatorship was ultimately a question for Congress, adding that putting housing finance back in the private sector has some appeal over the longer run.Claire Boston is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering housing, mortgages, and home insurance.Click here for real estate and housing market news, reports, and analysis to inform your investing decisionsClick here for more information and tools to help you handle your finances"

        "content": "By Karen BrettellNEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar was on track for a weekly loss against the euro on Friday as a delay in the introduction of trade tariffs planned by U.S. President Donald Trump raised hopes that they may not be as bad as feared, while optimism about a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine helped the single currency rally.The dollar index also fell to a nine-week low after data showed that retail sales fell more than expected in January, leading traders to raise bets that the Federal Reserve may cut rates two times this year.Markets are still hoping that tariff headwinds are not going to be as significant as perhaps previously feared, then probably the bigger element this week is enthusiasm about potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire and to what extent that might be positive for European growth in particular, said Vassili Serebriakov, an FX strategist at UBS in New York.The retail sales are probably a tertiary factor, but it's kept the dollar on the back foot, Serebriakov said.The euro rose 0.32% to $1.0497 and got as high as $1.0514, the highest since January 27. It is on pace for a weekly gain of 1.7%.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37% against the greenback to 152.22 per dollar.The dollar index was last down 0.35% at 106.72 and on track for a weekly loss of 1.3%. It reached 106.56, the lowest since December 12.Trump on Thursday tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports. Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick for commerce secretary, said the administration would address each affected country one by one and said studies on the issue would be completed by April 1.The broad announcement appeared designed at least in part to trigger talks with other countries, with a White House official saying Trump would gladly lower tariffs if other countries lowered theirs.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on Friday that the Trump administration is looking beyond tariffs and non-tariff barriers to examine currency manipulation as it studies the issue.Analysts say that tariffs could add to inflation, keeping the dollar higher as the Fed holds rates higher for longer.Trump also said on Friday he plans to impose tariffs on imported cars around April 2.The euro and other European currencies have been supported this week by optimism that Russia and Ukraine will reach a peace deal.Trump discussed the war in Ukraine on Wednesday in phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.Fridays retail sales data, meanwhile, comes after Thursdays producer price report for January pointed towards lower than previously thought core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index later this month, which is the Feds preferred inflation measure.Futures traders are now pricing in 41 basis points of cuts for the year, fully reversing a move towards reduced rate cut expectations after consumer price data came in hotter than expected on Wednesday.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 1.32% to $97,781.23.(Editing by Toby Chopra; editing by Diane Craft)"

        "content": "Fraud has been a hot-button issue across all facets of the transportation industry over the past several years, and the insurance sector is no exception. There has been an alarming rise in fraudulent and frivolous insurance claims, according to Demotech President Joseph Petrelli.Opportunistic plaintiff firms and adjusters are embedding themselves in these sectors, targeting insurance companies with increasingly sophisticated strategies, Petrelli said.Bad actors are drawn to the industry because of its ubiquitous nature and high insurance payouts, making trucking companies and their insurers prime targets. The impact of these schemes extends beyond financial losses; they disrupt operations, increase premiums and strain relationships between insurers and their clients.Demotech, known for its pioneering work in rating smaller insurance companies, initiated a research project in March 2022 to uncover the scale and tactics of fraudulent activity. According to Petrelli, the companys findings revealed alarming trends, such as the proliferation of online platforms encouraging lawsuits against trucking companies and insurers.Demotech works to protect its carriers by utilizing 4Warn, a cutting-edge solution designed to track and analyze potential threats. Using 4Warn, companies can identify plaintiff attorneys targeting their business, monitor the language used in lawsuits and even gauge how much these firms are spending to fuel their campaigns. This level of insight empowers insurers to anticipate and counteract fraudulent claims before they escalate.While the transportation industry is often a target of these tactics, the overall trend toward excessive litigation transcends the boundaries of any one industry.Petrelli also cited the recent rise of websites urging claimants to sue their insurance companies over incidents like the recent Los Angeles fire outbreak. These platforms not only exploit genuine tragedies but also create an open door for frivolous claims.While the scale of the fraud crisis is daunting, industry leaders like TIE are adopting innovative technologies to stay ahead.Steven Munro, managing partner at TIE, emphasized the importance of connectivity in preventing fraud. This push for greater collaboration between trucking companies and insurance companies comes at a time when transparency is being championed across the industry as a whole.Once known for their rugged individualism, companies across the transportation industry are seeing the value in banding together in the digital age. This is especially true when it comes to addressing fraud.The more connected we can be with our insurers, the better we can monitor, manage and assist, Munro said.A critical strategy involves integrating high-tech solutions, like cameras, into fleet operations.With ELD connections and cameras, insurance claims can be reported in as little as 10 minutes automatically, and video evidence can be reviewed almost instantly, Munro said.This rapid response capability not only deters fraudsters but also streamlines legitimate claims, fostering a sense of trust between insurers and their clients.The rise in insurance fraud underscores the need for a proactive approach. Industry leaders must embrace technology, enhance collaboration and stay vigilant against emerging threats.By investing in the right technologies and fostering stronger connections between insurers and policyholders, the transportation and supply chain sectors can protect themselves from opportunistic attacks. Moreover, initiatives like Demotechs research project serve as a vital resource in understanding and combating these challenges.As the landscape evolves, staying ahead requires not only innovation but also a shared commitment to safeguarding the industrys integrity.Click here to learn more about TIE.Click here to learn more about Demotech.The post Insurance fraud: The growing threat and the tech solutions fighting back appeared first on FreightWaves."

Some merchants and commodities traders have felt the strain. They are exposed if farmers are unable to deliver contracted volumes, and they also have financial exposure to rising prices in coffee futures.Brazilian coffee traders Atlantica and Cafebras won a grace period in courts late last year to renegotiate debts with clients after the firms said they were impacted by defaults from farmers.Central do Cafe is based in Muzambinho, in the South Minas Gerais region, where most of the coffee farms are located in the state. It buys coffee from local producers and sells it to roasters or exporters. Minas Gerais is the top coffee producing state in Brazil, the world's top coffee supplier.A notice from the company to its clients shared by a farmer with Reuters said the firm would be closed for an undetermined period while it evaluates its financial situation.\"We will soon call employees and business partners for meetings,\" Central do Cafe said in the notice, adding that the pause on its operations was necessary while it tries to renegotiate some of its debts.A local newspaper in the town also published the statement from the company.

Longer-term CD rates are not quite as high, but the top offers still hover around 3.00%-4.00% APY for terms of three years and longer.Today, the highest CD rate 4.35% APY, offered by two banks: Synchrony Bank (13-month CD) and LendingClub (10-month CD).Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners.This embedded content is not available in your region.See our picks for the best CD accounts available today>>If you're considering a CD, these rates are some of the highest available, especially when compared to the national average rates, which are significantly lower. It's also worth noting that online banks and credit unions generally offer more competitive rates compared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks.Read more: What is a good CD rate?Heres a look at the average CD rate by term as of January 2025 (the most recent data available from the FDIC):The highest national average interest rate for CDs stands at 1.82% for a 1-year term. However, in general, todays average CD rates represent some of the highest seen in nearly two decades, largely due to the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation by keeping interest rates elevated.If youre thinking about opening a CD, its important to choose one with a high APY and term length that matches your financial goals. Here are some tips for finding the best CD rates and accounts that match your needs:Shop around: Its a good idea to evaluate CD rates from a variety of financial institutions and compare your options before settling on an account. You can easily compare CD rates online.Consider online banks: Online banks tend to have lower overhead costs, which allows them to offer higher interest rates on CDs. In fact, online banks often have the most competitive rates available.Check minimum deposit requirements: Higher CD rates might come with higher minimum deposit requirements, so make sure the amount you plan to deposit aligns with the requirements to get the best rate.Review account terms and conditions: Beyond the CDs rate, look at terms for early withdrawal penalties and auto-renewal policies. Some CDs offer better terms for flexibility, such as no-penalty CDs, which allow you to withdraw your funds without a fee before the maturity date."

But a professional educational program seems well-timed, given ETFs' rising popularity and growing use by financial advisors.In 2024, ETF assets in the United States crested the $10 trillion mark, representing a fivefold increase over the past decade. Even though that increase in total assets includes market appreciation, the growth trajectory is like nothing the financial services industry has seen.According to etf.com data, there are now more than 4,000 ETFs trading in the U.S., a total bolstered by a record 650 ETF debuts last year, which beat the previous years record for launches by 150 ETFs.But the number of ETFs and swelling assets only show partly how and why ETF investing is evolving well past commonplace portfolio allocations.Product complexity has exploded, said Aniket Ullal, ETF analyst at CFRA.In 2024, over 40% of the ETFs listed in the U.S. used derivatives, he added. We have seen new categories like buffer ETFs and single-stock leveraged products emerge.The new certificate program is designed to equip financial advisors with resources and tools to have more informed conversations around the opportunity that ETFs might bring to their clients' portfolios, according to the announcement.The program covers an understanding of ETF fundamentals, highlights the global trends transforming the industry, and how ETFs can be used to develop a broad range of diversified investment portfolios that pursue client needs. The on-demand course is available through the Colleges learning platform. Students have up to 120 days to complete it.ETFs have revolutionized how investors build portfolios and have increasingly become the preferred vehicle for many, said Daniel Prince, U.S. head of iShares product consulting at BlackRock in a statement.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

He posted them less than an hour before new data showed underlying US inflation rose 0.4% in January, more than forecast, dimming the likelihood of immediate rate cuts.Trump in a subsequent post sought to blame the persistent inflation on his predecessor former President Joe Biden.The central bank chief told senators Tuesday there is no need to rush to adjust interest rates, a further signal that the Fed will be patient before lower borrowing costs again. The Federal Open Market Committee lowered rates at each of its last three meetings in 2024 but policymakers held the banks key policy rate steady in January.Powell has repeatedly declined to comment on how the Fed would respond to the presidents policy changes, emphasizing that it depends on what is actually enacted and how the mix of proposals interact to affect the economy.David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management Inc., predicted Powell would avoid responding to Trumps remarks during his testimony, and said the Fed should not rush to cut rates, citing uncertainty over tariffs, Trumps efforts to deport undocumented migrants and a massive tax package being negotiated in Congress.The Fed has to think about all of those things. So I think when theyve got clarity on immigration, tariffs and taxes this year, then they can take a look at, do we need to make any further adjustment, but right now they shouldnt do it, Kelly said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.Trumps comments mark a shift from remarks earlier this month, when he indicated that the Federal Reserve had made the correct decision, saying that holding the rates at this point was the right thing to do.While presidents traditionally refrain from commenting on the banks policymaking, Trump has regularly weighed in on the central banks handling of interest rates, frequently jabbing at Powell during his first term in the White House.In a virtual address to financial, business and political leaders at Davos last month, Trump had said he would demand an immediate drop in interest rates, which he blamed for increasing deficits. During the presidential campaign, Trump told Bloomberg News that he should be able to tell Powell how he thinks interest rates should change, and he has suggested that as a businessman he knows the issue well.Trumps policy proposals have added uncertainty to the US economic outlook as he ramps up tariffs on imports from China and on steel and aluminum. Trump has also delayed tariffs against Canada and Mexico and has promised to unveil reciprocal trade levies on countries as soon as this week.Most mainstream economists say those measures threaten to raise pressure on inflation, a major worry for voters and one which helped propel Trumps return to the White House.--With assistance from Jordan Fabian, Annmarie Hordern and Jonathan Ferro.(Updates with core consumer price index data in third paragraph, Trump post in the fourth paragaph, analyst comment)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Game Changer: How Ely Callaway Remade GolfWhy Fast Food Could Be MAHAs Next TargetElon Musks DOGE Is a Force Americans Cant Afford to IgnoreHow Ouras Smart Ring Bridged the Gap From Tech Bros to NormiesTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of Decline2025 Bloomberg L.P."

Those figures are just a portion of total outlays as they exclude debit card or digital wallet transactions, which have surged in popularity in recent years.The spending trend stems from efforts by Mileis team to keep the pesos value relative to the greenback steady, partly by letting the peso weaken at a pace of 1% per month. And with wages and prices outpacing the currencys slide, Argentina has become much more expensive.Januarys credit-card tally represents a strong appreciation of the exchange rate, since it reflects how cheap it has become to consume in dollars, said Juan Pedro Mazza, a strategist with Buenos Aires-based brokerage Grupo Cohen SA. It points to a potential significant current account deficit in the first month of 2025.Argentines are now spending their money in relatively cheaper neighbors like Uruguay, Brazil and Chile, chipping away at the countrys trade and investment flows. Argentina lost $2.1 billion last year, Mileis first in office, from tourism based on how much its nationals spent abroad versus how much foreigners consumed in Buenos Aires and beyond, according to the countrys statistics agency.Argentine governments on both sides of the aisle have long tried to discourage tourism spending abroad as the cash-strapped country needs all the dollars it can get.Milei inherited and has maintained a series of taxes on foreign purchases so that the implied exchange rate is more expensive than if Argentines were to use their debit cards or cash. But the effectiveness of that effort has dwindled as authorities have pared back some of those taxes. Argentina also has multiple exchange rates because of currency controls and the gap between them has collapsed as Milei has propped up the peso.--With assistance from Ignacio Olivera Doll.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of DeclineTrump Promised to Run the Economy Hotter.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in January, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's message that it was in no rush to resume cutting interest rates amid growing uncertainty over the economy.The consumer price index jumped 0.5% last month after gaining 0.4% in December, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Wednesday.In the 12 months through January, the CPI increased 3.0% after advancing 2.9% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3% and rising 2.9% year-on-year.The BLS updated weights and seasonal adjustment factors, the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data to reflect price movements in 2024.Some of the rise in the CPI last month probably reflected businesses pushing through price increases at the start of the year. Businesses could also have pre-emptively raised prices in anticipation of higher and broad tariffs on imported goods.President Donald Trump early this month suspended a highly telegraphed 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico until March. But a 10% additional tariff on Chinese goods went into effect this month. Economists expect that those tariffs, when they are eventually enforced, will lift inflation.Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that \"inflation moderated a little further last year,\" adding that \"recent progress has been bumpy.\"Inflation remains above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Chances of a rate cut this year are diminishing amid rising uncertainty over the economic impact of the Trump administration's trade, immigration and fiscal policies.Consumers' one-year inflation expectations surged to a 15-month high in early February as households perceived that \"it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy,\" a University of Michigan survey of consumers showed last week.Combined with a stable labor market, Bank of America Securities continues to believe that the Fed policy easing cycle is over. The central bank left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range in January, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September, when it embarked on its policy easing cycle.The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.4% in January. The so-called core CPI increased 0.2% in December. The core CPI has tended to print higher in January, which economists said suggested that seasonal effects lingered in the data even after seasonal adjustment.In the 12 months through January, the core CPI rose 3.3% after advancing a 3.2% in December.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

We will come up with a proposal after the election.The debt brake  introduced in the aftermath of the 2007 financial crisis  is one of the most fundamental fault lines in German politics and was the primary reason for the collapse of the governing alliance in November.It limits structural budget deficits to 0.35% of gross domestic product. And while it allows for exceptions during national emergencies or recessions, its increasingly seen as unfit for purpose given the countrys vast investment needs.Nagel has repeatedly called for a revamp, with the Bundesbank suggesting as early as 2022 that Germany should adopt the more flexible EU limits.Those rules allow governments to run structural deficits as high as 0.5% if their debt load is above 60%  and twice as much if debt is below that threshold.Speaking at an OMFIF event in the UK capital, Nagel reiterated that stance, saying that a reform of the debt break should be a 100% in line with what is necessary and what we ask for when it comes to the EU, to European law.The Feb. 23 snap election is likely to see Chancellor Olaf Scholz ousted by Friedrich Merz, who heads the conservative CDU/CSU bloc.

        "content": "By Michael S. Derby(Reuters) - Overall debt levels held by Americans rose modestly in the final quarter of last year on a healthy consumer sector, even as borrowing for automobiles faced some signs of stress, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday.Consumers are in pretty good shape in terms of the household debt landscape, largely driven by stable balances and solid performance in mortgage loans, the bank said in a posting detailing the findings on its latest report on the state of household debt, this time for the fourth quarter of 2024.However, for auto loans, higher car prices combined with higher interest rates have driven monthly payments upward and have put pressure on consumers across the income and credit score spectrum, New York Fed economists wrote.New York Fed researchers said that borrowing levels relative to income are pretty stable and still below levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic, even as some sectors like car lending face some trouble. The banks borrowing data details conditions for an economy with solid growth and low unemployment, even as inflation pressures remain elevated and short-term interest rates are high. The Feds current monetary policy stance has increased borrowing costs broadly, most notably chilling activity in the housing market.In the report, the bank said total household debt at the end of the year rose by 0.5% to $18.04 trillion. Credit card balances where up by $45 billion from the prior quarter to $1.21 trillion, while mortgage balances ticked up $11 billion to $12.61 trillion amid a rise in mortgage creation during the quarter. The report said that auto loan balances rose by $11 billion to $1.66 trillion versus the prior quarter.The New York Fed report also detected some ongoing fraying on the credit front, with 3.6% of debt in some form of trouble during the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarters 3.5% rate. The report said debt moving into troubled status was steady across all borrowing types with the exception of credit cards, which saw a small uptick in the transition into delinquency.Borrowing transitioning into serious delinquency, which means past due for three months or longer, edged up for auto loans, credit cards, home credit lines but was stable for mortgages, the report said.The New York Fed report zeroed in on issues with lending for automobiles. There, issues with rising prices and high borrowing rates have hit borrowers differently at different income levels, notably for those who bought expensive used cars during the pandemic and who may be underwater on loans now.But things may improve. The decline in auto prices could imply that the more recently originated vintages of auto loans may fare better as those loans age, New York Fed economists wrote.More broadly, bank data showed that around 123,000 consumers had a bankruptcy notation added to their credit record, down from the third quarter. Consumers with a thirdparty collection noted on their credit record was relatively stable in the fourth quarter, the bank said.(Reporting by Michael S. Derby; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

Now a fast-growing business, it unveiled plans last year to formally change its corporate structure.Musk and his own AI startup, xAI, and a consortium of investment firms want to acquire OpenAI so they can revert it back to its original charitable mission as a nonprofit research lab.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman quickly rejected the unsolicited bid in a post on social media and told questioners at a Paris summit on AI that the company is not for sale.Musk and Altman helped start OpenAI in 2015 and later competed over who should lead it. They've been in a long-running feud over the startups direction since Musk resigned from its board in 2018."

        "content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP)  The executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Ricos finances said that it is impossible for the U.S. territory to pay the $8.5 billion bondholders are demanding in a bankruptcy case involving the island's power company.Robert Mujica Jr. unveiled a new fiscal plan for Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority on Tuesday, stating that the government can pay creditors $2.6 billion. The plan, requested by a federal judge overseeing the case, does not call for any rate increases to help pay off the company's debt of more than $9 billion and the projected expenses are higher than those in the previous fiscal plan.The board remains in contentious mediation with creditors as it tries to restructure the only outstanding debt that remains since Puerto Rico declared in 2015 that it could not afford to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and then filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history two years later.Its gone on for too long, Mujica said of the case. Its important for us to get out of this one.Economists have said that the unresolved case has spooked potential investors and hampered economic development on the island.Mujica noted that officials dont yet know where they would obtain funding for the $2.6 billion theyre offering, but warned it shouldnt come from an increase in electric rates given already high power bills and the fragile state of Puerto Ricos grid.The system needs investment, Mujica said, adding that all revenue should go into fortifying and improving the grid. Puerto Ricans deserve to have a utility that is performing and that is reliable.The island suffers from chronic power outages that worsened after Hurricane Maria razed the grid when it slammed into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm in September 2017. However, the grid was already crumbling given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.Mujica said that if the government agreed to bondholder demands, which total $12 billion including interest, it would mean an electric rate increase of up to eight cents that he says Puerto Ricans cannot afford.The current offering of $2.6 billion, which represents an 80% reduction of the power companys debt, has been accepted by 44% of creditors and a third of all bondholders.Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, says the grid needs up to $25 billion in federal funding through fiscal year 2034 to fully rebuild and maintain the system.Of the $17 billion expected in funding from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, only $3.2 billion has been disbursed, Mujica said.The system right now is deteriorating faster than the investments are being made, he said.___Follow APs coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america"

        "content": "Most of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in a state of frozen animation this week after Trump administration officials ordered a halt to its work.But one of the agencys most popular tools for the public  its online consumer complaint portal  is still very much up and running. If youre struggling with problems at a bank or credit reporting agency, submitting a report may still be worth your while, freeze or no freeze.The system is designed to clear away customer service hoops by allowing Americans to send in complaints about their financial institutions directly to the CFPBs searchable database. Cases are then routed back to the company responsible for the issue, which is supposed to respond within about 15 days  though they have up to 60 to offer a final resolution.Crucially, the back end of the portal is automated, so it shouldnt be affected by the Trump administrations work stoppage. Send in a gripe, and it will still be forwarded on to Bank of America, Experian, or whatever debt collector has been lighting up your phone. According to one former CFPB official who spoke with Yahoo Finance, turning off the form would take a bit of work by the new administration.The portal has become an increasingly popular tool since it was launched in 2012, with the number of complaints submitted through it rising from a few hundred thousand each year to 2.7 million in 2024. In the process, its developed a fan base on sites like Reddit, where its common to find users recommending it to one another as a shortcut to deal with financial services headaches.About 80% of submissions these days involve problems with credit reports, while complaints about debt collectors and bank accounts make up the next two largest buckets, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report.The vast majority of complaints  99.6% of them last year  get a timely response, according to the bureau. In about 41% of cases, consumers get some sort of formal relief, while in another 53% they at least get an explanation for the companys action.One reason the system seems to work fairly well is that banks and credit bureaus know regulators  and the public  are watching. The complaints are made public on the CFPB website, and agency officials scrutinize them as part of the formal supervision process. When companies dont offer a reasonable response to a complaint, a regulator can order them to go back and fix the problem. They can also refer the issue to the CFPBs enforcement arm, which scans the database on its own for potential cases, as well.Even when the bureau is fully operational, its staff dont typically handle individual submissions as case workers. But there are exceptions: The student loan ombudsman, for instance, will sometimes take up consumer complaints directly with debt servicing companies.Americans can submit consumer complaints to other regulators, such as the Federal Trade Commission  but it essentially amounts to a tip for enforcement officials, who may or may not act on it. The CFPB portal is unique in that its designed to both alert regulators and help customers fix their problems on their own through a formalized process.CFPB officials arent the only ones watching over the complaint data, either. State consumer protection regulators can also plug into it, as can members of Congress.Still, one major concern at the moment is that, despite the automated process, companies will feel less pressure to respond seriously to formal complaints if CFPBs staff remains sidelined for a long period.If Elon Musk and other billionaires are successful at stopping the work of the bureau, the quality of the companys responses will degrade, the former official said. If youre a company and nobody is enforcing the law, why would you do the right thing?Jordan Weissmann is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance."

        "content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., on top of existing metals duties. He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday.Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The dollar rose and U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher.Here is what market participants are saying:KELVIN WONG, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, OANDA, SINGAPORE\"Trade War 2.0 is different in scope and implementation from Trade War 1.0 in 2018 as it involves more countries ... (and)includes all U.S. major trading partners that have significant trade surpluses with the U.S.\"All in all, Trade War 2.0 may upend global trade flows that in turn dampen global economic growth prospects, which may lead to a stagflation environment.\"Investors and short-term traders are now in flux in terms of playbook positioning as the global economy has not faced a stagflation environment in the last 15 years since the Great Financial Crisis of 2009.\"VASU MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OCBC, SINGAPORE\"It is unclear if Trump's latest steel and aluminium tariffs is a negotiation strategy which he may dial down on later. After all if implemented it will also hurt the U.S. given its dependence on imported steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico which are major suppliers of these metals to the U.S.Markets will be on edge and volatile with the escalating trade war and investors need to tread with caution for now and brace for possibly more market turbulence.\"KYLE RODDA, SENIOR MARKETS ANALYST, CAPITAL.COM, MELBOURNE\"It adds to the potential looming price shock from Trump's trade policy. In the short term that's inflationary. In the longer-run and in the aggregate, it's going to be a drag on growth. There's now also the issue of a tit-for-tat dynamic emerging in the global economy as competitors like China respond with counter measures. Currently, markets are mostly responding to the uncertainty. But as the odds of an all out trade war increases, they will have to increasingly discount marginally weaker economic activity.\"TOMO KINOSHITA, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, INVESCO ASSET MANAGEMENT JAPAN, TOKYO\"Although the details (of 25% tariff on steel and aluminum) have not been released, considering that the United States imports over $100 billion annually for steel and aluminum combined, the annual additional tariff resulting from this new tariff is likely to be around $25 billion. That would be less than 0.1% of U.S. GDP. The inflationary effect on the U.S. economy ... is expected to emerge slowly, but I think it would be at most around 0.1%, so the impact would be pretty limited.\"CHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE\"These threats appear legitimate and within Trump's power to implement on the basis of national security. The old playbook can't be used because China is no longer a significant supplier of steel to the U.S. after the 2018 tariffs. Instead, the impact will be more pronounced on countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil.\"The immediate concern, however, might not be inflation, as there could be counter effects such as demand slowdown. The bigger concern is the uncertainty and the shift towards a more protectionist world.\"TONY SYCAMORE, MARKET ANALYST, IG, SYDNEY\"It's been a very different reaction. This week started like last week did - we've seen tariff headlines, but the reaction has been somewhat different across asset classes ... U.S. equity futures are trading higher, and in fact, even the ASX 200 has bounced somewhat off its early lows. The Aussie dollar is still struggling a little bit, but my feel is that ... after the whipsaw ride we saw last week, there's going to be less of a temptation now to shoot first and ask questions later.\"DANIEL HYNES, SENIOR COMMODITY STRATEGIST, ANZ, SYDNEY\"I suspect U.S. manufacturers will have to wear higher prices as a result of these 25% tariffs. Its import reliance is high, around 40%-45% for aluminium and 12%-15% for steel.\"I suspect we see regional pricing react first. U.S. prices are likely to be big higher, with traders anxious to secure metal before the tariffs are applied. \"(Reporting by Asia markets team; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Edwina Gibbs)"

        "content": "As interest rates begin to fall following the Feds recent rate cuts, its more important than ever to ensure youre earning a competitive rate on your savings. One option you may want to consider is a money market account (MMA).These accounts are similar to savings accounts  they offer interest on your balance, but may also include a debit card and/or check-writing capabilities.Wondering where the top money market account rates can be found today? Heres what you need to know.From a historical perspective, money market account interest rates have been quite high. The national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.64%, according to the FDIC, but the top money market account rates often pay above 4% APY or even more  similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts.Heres a look at some of the highest MMA rates available today:See our picks for the 10 best money market accounts available today>>Additionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.This embedded content is not available in your region.Deposit account rates  including money market rates  are tied to the federal funds rate. This is an interest rate range set by the Federal Reserve and is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. When the Fed increases the federal funds rate, deposit account rates usually increase. And conversely, when the Fed lowers its rate, deposit rates fall.Between July 2023 and September 2024, the Fed maintained a target range of 5.25%5.50%. However, as inflation cooled and the economy improved, the Fed slashed the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024. It then cut an additional 25 bps in November, and another 25 bps in December. As a result, money market rates have begun to decline.Further rate cuts are expected in 2025, which means now might be the last chance for savers to take advantage of todays higher rates.Read more: Can you lose money in a money market account?Considering that money market account rates are still elevated, these accounts are an attractive option for savers. Even so, deciding whether its the right time to put money in a money market account also depends on your financial goals and the broader economic conditions. Here are some key factors to consider:Liquidity needs: Money market accounts offer easy access to your money since they often come with check-writing capabilities or debit card access (though there may be a cap on monthly withdrawals). If you need to keep your money accessible while still earning a decent yield, a money market account could be ideal.Savings goals: If you have short-term savings goals or want to build an emergency fund, a money market account can provide a safer place for your cash, with returns that are better than most traditional savings accounts.Risk tolerance: For conservative savers who prefer to avoid the ups and downs of the stock market, money market accounts are appealing because they are backed by FDIC insurance and cant lose principal. However, if youre saving for a long-term goal like retirement, riskier investments are necessary to generate higher returns that will get you to your savings target.Given that interest rates are still elevated, now could be a good time to consider a money market account, especially if youre seeking a balance of safety, liquidity, and better returns than traditional savings accounts. Comparing rates from different institutions will help you find the best options available.Today, the highest money market account rate is offered by Quontic Bank. It's MMA pays 4.75%, which is more than seven times the national average.In today's falling interest rate environment, it's quite difficult to find a deposit account that pays 5%. Some promotional checking accounts have rates above 5% APY, though checking accounts aren't a great place to store cash savings long-term. Instead, you may want to investigate market investments, which come with more risk than money market accounts and other types of deposit accounts, but also provide much higher returns, on average.Yes. As long as you open an account with a federally insured bank or credit union, your money market account is safe from market risk. The only way your account can lose money is if you incur fees.This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "Want to be successful in the stock market? Sound portfolio management rules are a crucial step.In particular, you need to make sure that one trade doesn't take on so much risk that it sinks your portfolio.But what happens when a logical level for your stop loss is larger than you would like? Adjust your position size. That way the larger risk for the trade doesn't turn into a larger risk for your portfolio.First, you need to have a set amount you are willing to risk per trade. Say you're willing to risk 1% of your portfolio on each trade. For a $100,000 portfolio that works out to $1,000 of portfolio risk. Sure, an unforeseen gap down in price could make you lose more. But for the most part, being disciplined in your portfolio management means those cases will be rare.Then, consider the risk percentage for the trade. Investor's Business Daily often suggests a 7% automatic sell from your purchase price. It's an easy portfolio management tool for reducing risk. If you buy a stock at 50, your stop triggers at 46.50.Next, determine your position size. Simply divide your dollars risked by your risk percentage. That gives you a position size of $12,500 ($1,000 divided by 0.08). In terms of a weight for your portfolio, that's 12.5% for a full position. This is our logic behind using eight positions for a fully invested portfolio and the model used for IBD Leaderboard. It's simply the way the math works out.Not all markets are created equal, nor is each trade. In a strong uptrend, you might consider getting more aggressive. You might be willing to risk more dollars per trade because the reward potential is greater. You may even use margin to juice up your returns. When things are weak, you may adopt a conservative stance. Consider reducing the portfolio risk to just half a percent per trade or less. It's also smart to do less trading in an unfavorable environment.There are also situations where allowing for a larger loss on the trade makes sense. What if you identify a strong stock that typically gets support at its 10-week moving average and at your entry, the 10-week line is 10% away? What do you do? You can adjust your position size.In this case, $1,000 risked will lead to a $10,000 position size ($1000/0.10). You're taking on a little extra risk for the trade, so you adjust your position size down from 12.5% of the entire portfolio to 10%.Of course, as with any portfolio management decision, consider the trade-offs. If the stock is truly a big winner, you will have less invested. But that might be better than passing up the trade entirely. Or even worse, your 8% loss triggers and then you watch the stock bounce off the 10-week line and go on a winning streak without you.Let's consider an example for practice. Alteryx is in the computer software database field. In a world of data and the necessary analysis that comes with it, Alteryx offers platforms that ease the process. (The company was acquired by Clearlake Capital Group in March 2024, and the stock is not trading any longer.)In 2019, MarketSurge pattern recognition identified a base breakout (1) on Jan. 7 at 67.50. If you got in right at the buy point your 8% stop was at 62.10. In its 119% run over the next nine months, it never triggered your stop.But what if you bought it above that buy point? We often use a 5% buy range above the buy point. Let's say you bought Alteryx stock at 70.88 the next week (2) right at the edge of the buy zone. That would put your 8% stop at 65.21, just 3.3% below the breakout. A little tight.And if you wanted to use the 10-week line as your stop, that was 14% away at 60.88. Why use the 10-week line? Many of the best performing stocks will find support at that level during their moves. Taking a step back to the weekly chart, you can end up riding a big winner for the bulk of its move if you hold it as long as it closes above the line.So if you decide to use the larger risk percentage of 14%, how do you adjust the position size? A little math ($1000/0.14) brings the position down to $7,143. Even if you take the larger percentage loss on the trade, your portfolio will only take the same hit of $1,000.A larger risk percentage made a big difference if you bought at the top of the 5% buy range. You might have survived the test down to 65.34 in February (3). But an 8% stop would have knocked you out at the beginning of March (4). If you were using a looser stop of 60.88, it didn't trigger. And while Alteryx stock fell below the 10-week line, if you waited until the close of the week, it got support and was right back above it.Another test of the 10-week line occurred in June (5) and by that time a sizable cushion was in place. When the decisive close below the 10-week line did happen (6), the move was truly over. A base of over 40% followed and a brief attempt at overtaking the old highs in February didn't last. Even selling at the close of the week, left you with nearly a 60% gain.However, there is a warning on the other side. You might come up with a risk percentage that is very small, 1% or so. The math will tell you that you can have an outsize position of 30% or more. Don't do it as a starting point. If you are going to have a concentrated position bigger than 20% or more, it's usually something to achieve through appreciation in your stock and possibly adds along the way. Not as a starting point.Proper risk management is the foundation of any successful trading plan. IBD traditionally uses a maximum stop loss of 8% on any given trade.An alternative is to determine the portion of your overall account you want to risk on any given trade and then place a stop near a reasonable area, such as the 10-week moving average. A decisive weekly close below the 10-week line is one of the best sell signals for intermediate-term trading.Risk no more than 1% of your portfolio on a single trade and even less in volatile markets. Your position size as a percentage of your portfolio can range from 10% to 15% in healthy markets. Avoid excessive position sizes when your stop is close to the entry price by reducing the dollars risked.This means given a $100,000 account, your maximum loss for any single trade would be $1,000. In difficult times, you would want to risk much less.There are two versions of the calculator: The first requires you to input the dollars risked, current stock price and stop-loss price. The second requires dollars risked, current stock price and the stop-loss percentage as a positive value. Both determine the dollar size of the position and number of shares to purchase.This article was originally published May 7, 2020, and has been updated.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:SwingTrader Has A Position Size Calculator: Here's How It WorksStart Building Your Watch List Now: Top Stocks In Leaderboard TodaySwing Trader Strategy Basics For Short-term TradesHow To Select, Buy And Sell Top Growth Stocks: The 7 Most Important Words On Wall Street"

        "content": "(Reuters) -The U.S. consumer price index increased more than expected in January, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's message that it was in no rush to resume cutting interest rates amid growing uncertainty over the economy.The CPI jumped 0.5% last month after gaining 0.4% in December, the Labor said on Wednesday. In the 12 months through January, it increased 3.0% after advancing 2.9% in December.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3% and rising 2.9% year-on-year.Fed funds futures show traders do not expect another Fed ease until at least September, having shown before the report expectations for a 25 basis point cut in June.MARKET REACTION:STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures turned 0.9% lower, pointing to a weak open on Wall StreetBONDS: The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.631%, while the two-year yield jumped to 4.37%FOREX: The dollar index extended to 0.43% higher, and the euro fell 0.3%COMMENTS:BEN VASKE, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ORION, OMAHA, NEBRASKAInflation has boiled back to the top of headlines as market and sentiment-based inflation expectations have been on the rise. This mornings report gave those expectations merit, with the MoM CPI reading ticking up once again, this month by 0.5%, and YoY CPI growth back to a 3-handle. The path forward for Powell and the Fed is getting murkier as investors are likely to continue questioning the rapid initial pace of rate cuts in Q4 and the economy grapples with tariff implications going forward.GENE GOLDMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT CETERA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, EL SEGUNDO, CA\"Today's number came in much hotter than expected. This further affirms that the Fed won't be cutting rates any time soon.\"\"This news is consistent with what Powell and all the other Fed speakers said yesterday, that we need to see lower inflation in order to cut rates.\"\"PPI comes out tomorrow and PPI is much more important than CPI because PPI should reflect should reflect producers going in and purchasing items in advance of the tariffs.\"\"Bond yield are higher. Futures are down and the dollar is higher. All this things suggest the Fed isn't likely to cut rates any time soon.\"ADAM BUTTON, CHIEF CURRENCY ANALYST, FOREXLIVE, TORONTOIt's very straightforward. The dollar is hot, responding to a higher CPI report, weve priced out about 10 basis points for this year. We're down to one cut priced in for all of the year. A lot of people were flagging the potential for a hot January reading, including us. This is the fourth year in a row with a surprisingly hot January reading. There are many types of price increases that occur at year end in sticky and non-services inflation categories that economists have been struggling to forecast. I guess probably the takeaway is no matter what the reason was for the upside surprise, the Fed has been very clear that it won't cut rates until inflation is close to 2%. So, whether it's one-offs due to eggs or the fire in California, the prospect of hitting 2% inflation this year when we start the year with 0.5%, is greatly diminished.CHARLIE WISE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, TRANSUNION IN CHICAGO (email)Todays CPI report shows that while well down from its recent peak in 2022, the inflation rate remains elevated above the stated goal of 2% year-over-year. This lends credence to the decision of the FOMC to pause further interest rate cuts at their January meeting. If similar elevated CPI readings present in future months, the Fed may continue their pause at the next meeting and potentially later, particularly if the employment situation remains solid. This could continue the cascading effect of stubbornly elevated interest rates impacting a range of credit products, directly or indirectly, including credit cards, mortgages, unsecured personal loans, and auto loans. BEN MCMILLAN, PRINCIPAL AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, IDX INSIGHHTS, TAMPA, FLORIDATo see CPI come in like this, especially given how strong energy has been in the recent months, isnt terribly surprising. Equities in the markets are selling off pretty hard last night. I think Powells comments yesterday were basically: were content to stay put as the economy is doing well and were kind of close to the neutral rate. I think hes going to reiterate the message that dont get your hopes up for more than one or if any rate cuts this year. The market was discounting two rate cuts this year. I wouldnt be surprised if that starts to go closer to zero.PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORKToday's data confirms that inflation is still a problem, and obviously it upholds the Fed's stand on being cautious in lowering interest rates.Coupled with the prospects of the tariffs, it adds to inflation worries.Its negative all the way around, and it certainly means that the yields are likely to move higher. Metals are under pressure because of the stronger dollar and the rising yields and stocks are basically falling out of bed.If it keeps up like this another month or two of these kinds of numbers, that probably means that the Fed is likely to stay on hold for the remainder of the year.(Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell made it clear that they're going to stick to their dual mandate, and that they're not going to be bullied by any politician.Trump has his hands tied. Will he pressure the Fed? Yes. Will the will the Fed blink? No.WHITNEY WATSON, GLOBAL CO-HEAD AND CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF FIXED INCOME AND LIQUIDITY SOLUTIONS, GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT (by email)Todays stronger than expected CPI release is likely to further cement the FOMCs cautious approach to easing. A resilient labor market also provides scope for patience. We think the Fed is likely to remain in wait and see mode for the time being and anticipate the Fed staying on hold at next months meeting.(Compiled by the Global Finance & Markets Breaking News team)"

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.Artificial intelligence has quickly become a tool many companies are looking to utilize in the coming years. According to Forbes, 64% of businesses believe that AI can help increase productivity  though many workers are afraid that its rising prevalence in the workplace could reduce the number of available jobs.In late January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Yahoo Finances Executive Editor Brian Sozzi asked a variety of economic leaders for their perspectives on AIs place in the workforce  and they shared their wide-ranging takes on the Opening Bid podcast.Here are some of the highlights.Morgan Stanley CEO and chairman Ted Pick sees AI as a tool to take care of routine tasks, such as taking notes. But ultimately, it will not replace the human aspect that makes many businesses thrive.Yes, the AI is super important,\" he said on Opening Bid. \"It brings a ton of efficiency to the cost structure and [is] disruptive to the mainframe and that type of thing. You don't need to write your notes because someone will spit it out. 20 hours of certain note debriefs is taken down by 80% ... [but] we still need the human orderly. That's never going to change.This embedded content is not available in your region.While AI may make certain day-to-day tasks easier to complete, he insisted that much of his business is relationship-driven.We talk about rigor, humility, and partnership, and if you don't have a timeline of a relationship, nobody's going to be all that impressed, Pick said. You worry about the little details. You may be off  you get a question wrong, you give advice [that] is not quite right  but you correct [it]. And you're focused on that client over time.Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also felt that AIs biggest pull is going to be its ability to take care of more mundane tasks.AI can write those reports, she said. So you give them the facts and the AI can write the report. That just is a massive time savings. Same with other regulatory reporting. So there's a lot ... where the technology can be used to take out a lot of very boring, rote work.This embedded content is not available in your region.She also predicted that AI will be a particularly useful tool in curating recommendations for an individuals investment portfolio and answering client questions.AI [will continue] to drive interesting ways to engage with investors using algorithm AI to make predictive decisions, she said.Economist Nouriel Roubini: AI will eventually replace many jobsEconomist Nouriel Roubini, also known as \"Dr. Doom,\" has a less optimistic outlook on AIs future in business. Though many view it as a useful tool to help eliminate more mundane tasks, he believes AIs rapid growth will quickly outpace job availability.There are two views, Roubini, who is a professor emeritus at NYUs Stern School of Business, said on Opening Bid. One is that AI is going to be complementary to existing jobs, replacing some, but creating many new ones  jobs of the future. But then the other view is that over time, eventually many jobs are going to be replaced by AI. We're not going to have enough jobs, and I think that over time, the latter view is going to be the correct one.This embedded content is not available in your region.He elaborated, saying that the breakthrough integration between software and hardware has made it so blue-collar and white-collar jobs will be easily replaced as AI progresses in its capability to learn and infer knowledge at a PhD level.It's terrifying, but it's happening in the next  literally  year or two, Roubini said. And that's going to be even a bigger revolution, I think, than [generative] AI.These technologies are capital intensive, high skill bias, and labor-saving, he continued. So if you own the machine or the capital that owns the machine, you're going to do well. But if you're a low-skilled or medium-skilled white-collar [or] blue-collar [worker], increasingly your job and income is going to be threatened by AI, and theres not going to be enough jobs in the future.The extent to which AI will disrupt work will ultimately depend on how it's implemented in the workforce.For investors and those watching key technological developments, Opportunities in AI will come in applications ... and who will use it, investor and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio said. Its very much like the internet and the dot-com period.This embedded content is not available in your region.While Dalio didn't comment directly on whether AI would disrupt the labor force, he reflected on some leadership lessons for creating effective organizations.The most important thing is understanding how to bring together workers' values, abilities, and skills, Dalio said.I want an idea meritocracy in which there is meaningful work and near meaningful relationships through radical truthfulness and radical transparency, he said. In other words, can I share with you what I think in a non-hierarchical way? Can you share with me what [you] think?

        "content": "Three weeks into his second presidential term, Donald Trump is largely getting his way on Cabinet nominees, deregulation, deportation and Elon Musks dismantling of the federal bureaucracy. His biggest priority, a huge set of tax cuts requiring Congressional legislation, is coming into focus.One thing, however, is not going according to plan: Interest rates. And its already getting under Trumps skin.Interest rates should be lowered, Trump posted on social media on February 12. Something which should go hand in hand with tariffs.Markets dont see it that wayand unlike the many politicians Trump is steamrolling in Washington, markets cant be bullied. Stubbornly high interest rates, in fact, could end up the bane of Trumps second term.The Federal Reserve sets short-term interest rates that mostly affect banks, and Trump has already trained his guns on Fed chair Jay Powell. Trump blames the Fed for failing to head off the high inflation that raged for two years starting in 2022, and he blasted the Fed when it chose forego a rate cut at its last meeting, in January.What most consumers and businesses care about is longer-term rates such as those on mortgages, car financing and business loans.Short- and long-term rates normally move in the same direction, which means the Fed has some influence over the borrowing rates most people pay. But markets have a say, too. And since last September, long-term rates, represented by the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, have gone up by roughly a percentage point even though the Fed has cut short-term rates by a like amount.The bond market doesnt explain itself, but investors take the rise in 10-year rates to reflect concerns about higher future inflation. Those concerns are showing up in other data too, such as the University of Michigans monthly consumer surveys, which shows that consumers increasingly think inflation will be higher one year and five years from now.There are two main reasons inflation could worsen.One is that price hikes in some spending categories, such as housing, insurance and child care, remain persistently high, along with egg-sploding egg prices caused by avian flu. Theres not much Trump can do about that. The other reason is that businesses and consumers expect Trumps tariffs to raise prices by more than theyd ordinarily go up. There is something Trump can do about that. But so far, hes choosing not to.Tariffs are one of Trumps favorite policy tools, and hes applying them lavishly. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on most Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on most imported steel and aluminum. He has threatened 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports along with customized reciprocal tariffs on a host of trading partners that put higher barriers of purchases of American goods than we do on theirs.Trump says he will demand lower interest rates, and through some unexplained logic he seems to think that would complement his tariffs. If Trump had total control of the Federal Reserve, he could force it to lower short-term rates. The likely result would be even worse inflation, as history has shown. Lucky for investors, Trump doesnt control the Fed, and chair Powell has indicated hell remain impervious to political pressure.Theres almost nothing Trump can or could do to control long-term rates, which may make him increasingly irascible. If inflation does go higher, as some expect, rates would likely to higher, too. Thats because the eroding value of money compels investors to seek a higher return to commit their cash.Mainstream forecasters think the 10-year Treasury rate will stay near its current level, around 4.5%, for the next year or two. That equates with mortgage rates of around 7%.Capital Economics says the 10-year Treasury could hit 4.75% if Trumps tariff war ends up being worse than markets expect. Some strategists think it could top 5%, with most other consumer and business rates rising accordingly.Theres nothing wrong with interest rates at those levelsexcept they'll probably infuriate Trump.During his first term (prior to Covid), the 10-year Treasury averaged just 2.42%and even then Trump complained that rates were too high. Rates are now nearly double those levels. Mortgage rates, currently around 7%, are near historical averages, yet nearly three points higher than during Trumps first term. Housing affordability is far worse now than during Trump 1.0.Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter.Trump promotes himself as the fixer who can solve all problems other politicians cant, through superior dealmaking ability and other unique talents. So political analysts are beginning to game out what Trump might do when interest rates disobey his command to decline.Jaret Seiberg of TD Cowen suggests that Trump might push for a greater government role in capping interest rates, starting with the rates on credit card balances, which are often double-digits. We worry the door is starting to open on giving the federal government stronger usury authority, Seiberg wrote in a February 12 analysis.One reason that could be worrisome is it could dent bank profits. That may not bother ordinary folks, except that banks unable to set rates high enough to price in risks would lend less money,and possibly stop lending to higher-risk borrowers altogether. A credit crunch would hurt some consumers and possibly slow the whole economy.Peter Orszag, CEO of investing firm Lazard, argues that other countries seeking to retaliate amid Trump's trade wars could even use higher rates as a kind of economic weapon. If foreign holders of US debt such as Japan and China wanted to retaliate against Trumps tariffs, they could sell some of their Treasury holdings, which would push US rates up and force the whole US economy to deal with higher borrowing costs.This makes Treasury markets a ripe target if negotiations result in prolonged conflict, Orszag wrote recently in the Washington Post.It might all sound a bit fantastical, but so does hiring a tech oligarch with no government experience to right-size a federal bureaucracy that is multiples larger than the biggest corporation. If rates come down and Trump seems satisfied, then it might be a false alarm.But nobody can be sure what Trump, growing used to getting his way, will do when he meets the resistance of an unmoving market.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Michael S. DerbyNEW YORK (Reuters) - Over two days of testimony this week before Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated there's no imminent end to the central bank's balance sheet wind down process, as some banks have moved to push back their own end date for a process commonly referred to as quantitative tightening.I think we have a ways to go on reducing the size of central bank bond holdings and there are no signs yet that market liquidity has shrunk enough to affect the Fed's reduction in holdings of Treasury and mortgage bonds, Powell told a House panel Wednesday.Powell's observations on quantitative tightening, or QT, comes as the Fed has shed just over $2 trillion from its holdings. The Fed is seeking to extinguish liquidity it added to markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it bought trillions in bonds to stabilize markets and goose economic growth by lowering longer term borrowing costs.Since the Fed began QT it has been seeking to reduce overall market liquidity, most clearly measured in the level of bank reserves, to levels that allow for normal levels of money market interest rate volatility, while allowing the Fed firm control over the federal funds rate, its main tool to influence the momentum of the economy.The Fed is also trying to avoid a replay of the events of September 2019 when, during its last chapter of QT, too much liquidity got taken out of the system, requiring the Fed to start adding it back in aggressively.The Fed has taken a number of steps to avoid this happening again, like slowing the pace of its drawdown and setting up new liquidity facilities, while providing more guidance about the factors it is watching. But it has struggled to offer much guidance about when it can stop QT, except to say that day doesn't appear imminent.Over recent days, some banks have pushed back their QT endgame estimates relative to the most recent consensus, which eyed a June stop date.\"Recent communication suggests that the Fed is content to let QT continue to run despite the potential for low visibility into reserve demand over the coming months due to debt limit dynamics,\" economists at Goldman Sachs said in a report Friday.Bank forecasters said that while they'd expected the Fed to wind up the drawdown at the end of the second quarter, now they see that happening at the close of the third quarter, with Treasury bond run off stopping at the end of the second quarter and mortgage run off ended by the third quarter.Morgan Stanley economists also kicked the QT can down the road.\"Still-abundant reserves and lack of significant pressures in money markets at month-end make it unlikely the Fed will change its balance sheet normalization plans in March as we previously expected,\" they wrote to clients. \"We adjust our baseline view for an end to QT in June,\" which would take Fed holdings to $6.33 trillion.(Reporting by Michael S.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US wholesale prices rose in January by more than forecast on higher food and energy costs, highlighting only limited progress on inflation ahead of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.The producer price index for final demand climbed 0.4% from a month earlier following an upwardly revised 0.5% increase in December, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3% gain. Compared with a year ago, the PPI increased 3.5%.Economists pay close attention to the report because several of its components feed into the Federal Reserves preferred inflation measure  the personal consumption expenditures price index. Those categories were more favorable in January, registering declines in most health care items and in airfares.Stock futures climbed while Treasury yields and the dollar fell after the report.The data on wholesale prices follow a surprising consumer price index report Wednesday that showed underlying inflation at the start of the year was highest since March. The figures sharply reduced odds that Fed policymakers will lower interest rates more than once in 2025, with some economists expecting no rate cuts due to the fallout from higher duties on imported goods.The components that feed into the Feds preferred PCE price measure were, on the whole, very tame, Paul Ashworth, the chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. Overall, better news than yesterday on price inflation, but core PCE still comes in well above the 2% target.Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored and central bankers have scope to be patient with rate adjustments. Still, President Donald Trumps policy proposals, including tariffs, have introduced some uncertainty to the economic outlook.The PPI report showed a 1.1% increase in food prices, including a 44% jump in egg prices from a month earlier amid an ongoing influenza outbreak among US poultry flocks. Energy prices rose 1.7%. Excluding food and energy, the PPI climbed 0.3%, and 3.6% from January of last year.Overall goods prices increased 0.6%, marking a third straight month of outsize advances. The cost of goods excluding food and energy was up a more modest 0.1% for a second month.Prices of commodities more generally have been marching higher this year. The Bloomberg Commodity Index is near its highest level since May, in part reflecting higher prices for metals, corn and coffee.Meanwhile, the PPI report showed services prices rose 0.3%. The BLS said a third of the increase was accounted for by a surge in the cost of traveler accommodation services. Portfolio management services costs, a category that feeds into the PCE index and largely tracks movements in the stock market, rose for a second month.A separate report released Thursday by the Labor Department showed initial applications for US unemployment benefits declined last week by 7,000 to 213,000. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, declined to 1.85 million in the week ended Feb. 1.--With assistance from Mark Niquette.(Updates with chart.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com2025 Bloomberg L.P."

        "content": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Californias plan that provides insurance to homeowners who cant get private coverage needs $1 billion more to pay out claims related to the Los Angeles wildfires, the state Insurance Department said Tuesday.The FAIR Plan is an insurance pool that all the major private insurers pay into, and the plan then issues policies to people who cant get private insurance because their properties are deemed too risky to insure. The plan, with high premiums and basic coverage, is designed as a temporary option until homeowners can find permanent coverage, but more Californians are relying on it than ever. There were more than 452,000 policies on the Fair Plan in 2024, more than double the number in 2020.The plan says it's expecting a loss of roughly $4 billion from the Eaton and Palisades Fires, which sparked Jan. 7, destroyed nearly 17,000 structures and killed at least 29 people. Roughly 4,700 claims have been filed as of this week, and the plan has already paid out more than $914 million.Under a FAIR Plan request approved by the state Tuesday, all insurers doing business in California will have to bear half the cost and can pass on the rest to all policyholders in the form of a one-time fee. Insurers can collect that cost in the next two years. The state Insurance Department must approve those costs.State officials didn't immediately have details on how large the fee would be. In approving the request, the state allowed the plan to send out notices and collect funding from marketplace insurers within 30 days.Its the first time the Fair Plan has sought approval for additional money in more than 30 years, the department said.I took this necessary consumer protection action with one goal in mind: the FAIR Plan must pay claims just like any other insurance company, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement.I reject those who are hoping for the failure of our insurance market by spreading fear and doubt,\" Lara said. \"Wildfire survivors cant cash what ifs to pay for food and rent, but they can cash FAIR Plan checks.The plan also expects to receive $1.45 billion in reinsurance to help pay out claims. It anticipates it will have roughly $400 million left by July.According to the plan, 45% of the wildfire claims filed so far are reported as total losses, 45% as partial losses and 10% as fair rental value.Insurers on Tuesday said theyre committed to helping the recovery process after the fires and that the ability to recoup some of the cost from ratepayers will prevent companies from leaving the state.This is essential to prevent even greater strain on Californias already unbalanced insurance market and avoiding widespread policy cancellations that would jeopardize coverage for millions of Californians, said Mark Sektnan of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the largest national trade association for home, auto and business insurers.But a consumer watchdog group, which opposed a rule that allows insurers to pass off costs to policyholders, said it will challenge the effort.\"Consumer Watchdog is exploring every legal option to stop a bailout if any insurance company seeks to make consumers pay, Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement.California is undergoing a yearslong effort to stabilize its insurance market after several major insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in the state in 2023, which pushed hundreds of thousands of homeowners onto the FAIR Plan. Wildfires are becoming more common and destructive in California due to climate change, and insurers say thats making it difficult to truly price the risk on properties.Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 15 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The state now gives insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing more policies in high-risk areas. That includes regulations allowing insurers to consider climate change when setting their prices and allowing them pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers."

Despite lower approval odds, Dogecoin ETF markets lead in trading volume with $450,000 in combined bets.Market activity shows distinct patterns across different cryptocurrency categories, with an unexpected twistwhile traders assign higher approval odds to established blockchain platforms, the memecoin Dogecoin has attracted the highest trading volume. This suggests a disconnect between predicted outcomes and trader interest, particularly in more speculative assets.The stark contrast between July and year-end odds suggests traders expect most approvals to come in the latter half of 2025, with probabilities nearly doubling when extending beyond the summer deadline.Permalink |  Copyright 2025 etf.com.

There may be a reprieve, like there was with the Mexico and Canada tariffs recently, but if not, many Asian economies are vulnerable.This will only deepen the nervous sentiment following the bruising day on Friday, where the big three U.S. indices lost 1% or more. Australian and Japanese stock futures are pointing to lower opens on Monday.The negative tone is mostly down to Friday's U.S. employment report which showed slowing job growth, but a fall in the unemployment rate and surprisingly strong wage growth. Rates traders are now fully pricing in only one Fed rate cut this year, and not until October.The 'risk off' reaction shows inflationary pressures and the impact on interest rates weighed more on investors' minds than any positivity from the strong growth signals. A closely-watched U.S. consumer inflation expectations survey on Friday was particularly strong too.That said, the dollar and U.S. yields have been on a downward path in recent weeks, as a few key indicators have suggested U.S. growth may be slowing. That has loosened financial conditions, which has helped offset some of the tech- and earnings-related selling on Wall Street.If inflationary pressures in the United States are bubbling up, they are pointing in the opposite direction in China - figures on Sunday showed that the battle against deflation is far from over.Consumer price inflation rose 0.7% in January on a month-on-month basis, slightly slower than expected, and rose 0.5% annually, the highest since August. Producer prices fell at a 2.5% annual rate, however, a much faster decline than the -2.3% consensus view in a Reuters poll.Annual producer inflation has been negative since October 2022. Little wonder Chinese government bond yields have slumped to their lowest on record.It's a completely different story in Japan, where bond yields and the currency are rising. The two-year government bond yield is the highest since 2008, and the yen has appreciated 5% in a month.According to Goldman Sachs, financial conditions in Japan are now the tightest in five months, and if the latest signals from the Bank of Japan are to be believed, they are likely to get even tighter.Financial conditions across emerging markets have loosened in recent weeks thanks to the fall in U.S. yields and the dollar. But not much, and tariff-related concerns loom large.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Monday:- Taiwan's TSMC monthly sales (January)- Japan trade (December)- Japan current account (December)(By Jamie McGeever, editing by Diane Craft)"

        "content": "The Federal Reserve reduced its target interest rate three times in 2024. As a result, high-yield savings account rates have been falling. That said, some of the best accounts still pay above 4% APY.In order to get the highest interest rate possible on your savings, its important to do your research and find competitive offers. Not sure where to start? Heres a closer look at savings interest rates today and where you can find the best ones.The average interest rate on a traditional savings account is only 0.41%, according to the FDIC. However, the best savings rates can be found on high-yield accounts, which often pay much more.As of February 10, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.46% APY. This rate is offered by Vio Bank and there is no minimum opening deposit.Read our full review of Vio BankHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:This embedded content is not available in your region.Related: 10 best high-yield savings accounts available today>>Over the last decade, savings account interest rates have fluctuated quite a bit. From 2010 to about 2015, rates were rock-bottom, hovering at around 0.06% to 0.10%. This was largely due to the 2008 financial crisis and the Federal Reserves decision to lower its target rate to near-zero in order to spur economic growth.From 2015 to 2018, interest rates began to gradually increase. However, they remained low by historical standards. Then the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to another sharp decrease in rates as the Fed once again cut rates to stimulate the economy. This brought average savings interest rates down to new lows, around 0.05% to 0.06% by mid-2021.Since then, savings account rates have recovered considerably, largely driven by the Fed's interest rate hikes in response to skyrocketing inflation. However, the Fed finally lowered the federal funds rate in September, November, and December 2024, and as a result, deposit rates are beginning to fall as well.The following is a look at how savings interest rates have changed over the past decade:Despite the fact that interest rates have risen substantially since 2021, the average savings account rate is still fairly low, especially compared to market investments. If youre saving for a long-term goal such as a childs education or retirement, a savings account probably wont generate the returns needed to reach your goal.On the other hand, if youre saving for an emergency fund, home down payment, vacation, or other short-term goal, a high-yield savings account is ideal  especially if you want to access the funds as needed. Other types of deposit accounts, including money markets and CDs, may offer similar or even better rates, but restrict how often you can make withdrawals. The key is to shop around and find an account that provides a competitive rate with low or no fees.This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesInflation rose unexpectedly in January, with the Consumer Price Index rising 3% over the last 12 months, up from 2.9% in December.Forecasters had expected inflation to slow down, but prices for food, gas, and housing pushed the inflation rate out of the 2% range for the first time since May.Higher inflation means the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates anytime soon.Inflation was supposed to be slowing down by now. Instead, it's hitting the gas.The cost of living rose 3% over 12 months ending in January as measured by the Consumer Price Index, up from a 2.9% increase in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday. It was the highest annual rate since May and blew past the expectations of forecasters, who had expected it to slow down to 2.8%, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.The fourth month of rising inflation in a row highlighted how progress against the post-pandemic burst of inflation has stalled. Prices for necessities are still rising faster than the typical 2% annual rate before the pandemic. Increases in prices for housing, food, and gas drove the overall inflation rate upward.The unexpected January jump in inflation has implications for the Federal Reserve, which manipulates short-term lending rates to influence the economy and keep price increases under control.Fed officials held the fed funds rate steady at their last meeting in January, keeping rates higher than normal in hopes of slowing the economy and pushing inflation down to 2%.Higher inflation reduces the chances the Fed will cut rates (which would give some relief to borrowers on credit card and auto loans) anytime soon. According to the CME Groups FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data, the majority of traders don't expect the Fed to make a rate cut until at least September. Those majorities strengthened after the report's release.The Fed's policy committee meets again to set interest rates in March.\"We think the Fed is likely to remain in wait and see mode for the time being and anticipate the Fed staying on hold at next months meeting,\" Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, wrote in a commentary.Prices rose 0.5% in January from December, the highest monthly inflation rate since August 2023.Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, rose 3.3% over the year, up from 3.2% in December. Economists and policymakers look at \"core\" inflation measures when gauging the direction of inflation since food and energy prices can swing up and down from month to month. Rising prices for car insurance, recreation, used vehicles, medical care, communication, and airline fares all pushed core inflation up.Price increases could get worse before they get better. Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump could push up prices for items from China. Further tariffs against Mexico and Canada could raise prices for goods from those countries if they go into effect in March, as Trump has said they will. And most things made of metal could get get more expensive once Trump's tariffs against steel and aluminum imports go into effect in March.Read the original article on Investopedia"

Trump has said the government is bloated and too much money is lost to waste and fraud. Firings had also begun elsewhere in the federal government, including at the Department of Education and the Small Business Administration.But the Trump administration's actions are increasingly being challenged. Critics have questioned the administration's approach and experts have flagged concerns about the legality of the firings, as most civil service employees can be fired only for bad performance or misconduct.Earlier on Thursday, a CFPB employee union and organizations including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a federal lawsuit asking a court to block the Trump administration's efforts to kill the agency.TERM EMPLOYEESThe latest termination letters to CFPB employees, dated February 13, were sent by Adam Martinez, acting chief human capital officer at the agency.Term employees have contracts of more than one year and up to four years, which can be extended, according to federal regulations. Their first year of service is a trial period, when they can be terminated by the agency at any point. The two notices reviewed by Reuters were for employees who had been at the agency for more than one year.\"The purpose of this memorandum is to notify you that your employment will be terminated effective at the close of business on February 13, 2025,\" Martinez wrote.The memos told employees they could seek recourse if they believed their firings were the result of discrimination based on race, religion, sex or other factors, or the result of whistleblower activities.The latest round of notices came after CFPB fired scores of probationary staff on Tuesday as part of a larger effort to gut the agency.The CFPB, which has been a lightning rod for conservatives and the industry since it was established by Congress in 2010, was hobbled over the weekend, when Vought ordered staff to cease all \"supervision and examination activity.\"On the social media platform X, Erie Meyer, the CFPB's chief technologist, said that a group of private-sector technologists she had hired were now gone.\"They were looking into big tech. Trump just fired them. All of them,\" she wrote.(Reporting by Chris Prentice, Douglas Gillison, Nupur Anand and Pete Schroeder; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Michael Perry)"

He reached out via direct message, inviting me to speak at the FreightWaves F3 Future of Freight Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee. What began as a simple tweet turned into a 15-minute conversation on stage, one that resonated so deeply that when we stepped off, we both knew it couldnt end there.A few weeks later, we met on Zoom, and as we started talking, the first thing that came to our minds was The Playbook.Why The Playbook?Because for as long as Ive been in this industry  25 years and counting  there has never been a truly comprehensive resource for small carriers, owner-operators or those looking to become one.Back when I got started, there was nothing  no centralized information, no real roadmap for success. You learned by trial and error, often at a high cost. Today, while information is easier to find, its fragmented. More importantly, its often flat-out wrong.Social media has made it easier than ever for misinformation to spread, and truckers are paying the price for bad advice. Ive seen it firsthand  people losing their businesses because they followed the wrong guidance, overpaying for services they didnt need or failing to build sustainable operations because they never had the right playbook to follow.Thats why we built The Playbook  to give small carriers the right information, in the right way, at the right time.What Is The Playbook?The Playbook isnt just a website. Its not a course. Its not just another content hub. Its a one-stop resource designed to give trucking business owners and aspiring ones the exact tools they need to succeed in an industry thats only getting more competitive.The Playbook is built on education, data and community. It provides clear, fact-based guidance on the key areas of running a trucking business: compliance, finance, operations and sales. But more than that, its a structured, ongoing resource that ensures small carriers have everything they need to build and scale their business the right way.The Playbook includes:A digital learning hub with structured courses and training on critical trucking business topics. This isnt scattered, outdated information  its a step-by-step roadmap built on real-world experience.A biweekly Masterclass designed to go deep into essential topics such as pricing strategies, compliance updates, shipper outreach and more.A monthly Small Carrier Market Update, providing insight into freight trends, rate shifts and industry changes that directly impact small carriers and independent owner-operators.Industry-specific data and insights backed by FreightWaves, ensuring Playbook members get access to real-time market intelligence that larger carriers have relied on for years.The Long Haul podcast, bringing real conversations about the industry, business growth and the challenges that small carriers face. This will feature deep-dive discussions with industry leaders, successful carriers and subject matter experts.A partner portal connecting small carriers with vetted, reliable industry partners offering services designed to help them grow and operate more efficiently.Special Playbook events, including in-person workshops, networking sessions, and exclusive access to FreightWaves conferences and discussions tailored to small carriers.Real case studies and expert interviews showcasing successful small carriers that have built sustainable, profitable trucking businesses.Tools and templates, including spreadsheets, calculators, contract templates and other essential business resources that help small carriers run their operations without having to start from scratch.Why FreightWaves?Because FreightWaves is the pulse of the industry.FreightWaves isnt just a news source  its a powerhouse of data, analytics and insights that the biggest players in the industry rely on every day. But for too long, small carriers have been left out of the conversation. Theyve had to piece together information from unreliable sources, trying to compete in an industry where knowledge is power  and where, too often, that knowledge hasnt been accessible to the very people who need it most.The Playbook is changing that.By partnering with FreightWaves, were ensuring that small carriers, independent owner-operators and those just getting started finally have access to the same level of insight and strategy that larger carriers have used to dominate the industry for years.Why Me?Because Ive been exactly where you are. From day one. As soon as I was old enough to get my CDL, I had it.I started in this industry behind the wheel, grinding it out as a driver with nothing but a truck and a Yellow Pages to find loads. I built a fleet from scratch, navigated the ups and downs, and made every mistake in the book  mistakes that cost me money, time and opportunities.But I learned. I adapted. And most importantly, I found better ways to do things.For years, Ive dedicated my journey to helping small carriers not just survive, but thrive. Through coaching, mentorship and training, Ive helped countless trucking business owners build sustainable, profitable companies. Now, with The Playbook, Im bringing that mission to an even bigger audience.This is more than just content. This is the real playbook for success in trucking.The Future Starts NowThe Playbook isnt just a project. Its a movement.Its the start of something that should have existed a long time ago  a structured, trusted, fact-based resource for small carriers and owner-operators who are tired of sifting through bad advice and misinformation.And this is just the beginning.The Playbook will grow. It will evolve. It will become the go-to resource for small carriers looking to gain an edge in an increasingly complex industry.Because at the end of the day, my mission remains the same:I want to leave the industry in a better place than I found it.BioAdam Wingfield is the founder and managing director of Innovative Logistics Group, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based trucking consulting and carrier services firm that focuses on providing resources and success guidance to small carriers.

        "content": "By Davide BarbusciaNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration's pledge to contain long-term U.S. Treasury yields has strengthened bond market expectations that a long-desired regulatory shift on bank leverage requirements could be finally looming.Some traders are betting regulators may soon focus on a review of the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), a rule requiring big U.S. banks to hold an extra layer of loss-absorbing capital against U.S. government debt and central bank deposits.The possible policy change would mean banks would not need to set aside as much extra money when they hold safe assets like Treasuries.This could eventually help push U.S. Treasury yields lower, some investors and analysts said, by giving banks more leeway to hold Treasuries and likely boosting demand.The anticipation comes after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that President Donald Trump's administration was focused on containing 10-year Treasury yields, a building block of global financial markets and a benchmark for consumers' borrowing costs.The White House and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Ryan O'Malley, head of portfolio management at Ducenta Squared Asset Management, said a potential review of the SLR would be positive for the Treasury market and other debt assets, which would benefit from banks freeing up their balance sheets.\"It will increase their demand for Treasuries and other assets. It will also probably strengthen banks' credit profile,\" he said.The SLR was introduced as part of regulatory efforts following the 2008 global financial crisis. Over time, however, many Treasury market participants have come to see it as a major obstacle to banks providing liquidity to traders, particularly at times of heightened volatility.The Bank Policy Institute (BPI), a trade association representing large U.S. banks, said in a recent paper that a recalibration of the ratio would be crucial to preserving market functioning, particularly given the prospect of rising government debt issuance due to large budget deficits.\"We think changes to the SLR could be made relatively quickly,\" Francisco Covas, executive vice president and head of research at BPI, told Reuters in an interview.The SLR should be near the top of the list of capital priorities for U.S. regulators, Covas added, referring to the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Spreads of swap rates over Treasury yields have widened in recent days, a sign that investors are starting to anticipate a review of the rule. Interest rate swaps allow traders to hedge interest rate risk by exchanging a floating rate for a fixed rate, or vice versa.Swap spreads, which have been deeply negative over the last few years, widened - or become less negative - following Bessent's comments on the 10-year yield, and after recent Fed policymakers' hints at SLR revisions.The 10-year and 30-year swap spreads have gone up by about five and 10 basis points over the past week, hitting their widest since June 2024 and December 2023, respectively.TREASURY MARKET RESILIENCEThe Fed in April 2020 temporarily excluded Treasuries and central bank deposits from the SLR to boost liquidity as Covid-19 pandemic fears gripped investors. But it let that exclusion expire the following year.Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress this week he was supportive of reducing the ratio, saying it would help Treasury market liquidity. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman also addressed the SLR in a speech last week, saying the Fed should \"take action to address the unintended consequences of bank regulation.\"Travis Hill, acting chairman of the FDIC, mentioned the SLR in remarks last month in which he called for an overhaul of other U.S. capital rules.The renewed focus on the SLR comes amid broader regulatory efforts to improve liquidity in the Treasury market.One key reform is a rule adopted by the SEC in December 2023 which will force more trades through clearing houses. It will be implemented in phases by June 2026, even though Wall Street associations have recently asked regulators for more time to implement it.\"In light of the U.S. Treasury clearing mandate ... we want to make sure that the SLR is not one of the areas that could impede the ability of banks to support the U.S. Treasury market,\" said Lisa Galletta, head of U.S. prudential risk at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. ISDA has advocated for a reform of the rule.Changes to the SLR, however, may only have a marginal impact on reducing risk premiums demanded by investors, which influence yields, and could carry some risk, said Deutsche Bank in a recent note.\"By lowering the resilience of the banking system, it increases the probability of banking stress that would require a fiscal response,\" analysts said.(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia; editing by Megan Davies and Nia Williams)"

It was followed by five U.S. peers -- Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan.In Canada, TD Bank, Bank of Montreal, National Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) withdrew from the coalition last month ahead of Trump being inaugurated as president.Macquarie did not say why it was leaving the NZBA but said it would give an update on its climate activities in its annual report in May 2025.\"After years of touting itself as a green bank, Macquarie is showing its true colours following the big U.S. banks into undermining global climate goals,\" said Kyle Robertson, a senior banking analyst at Market Forces.However, Australia's big four banks -- Westpac, ANZ Group Holdings, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank -- are still part of the alliance.HSBC, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Singapore's DBS Bank, among others, also remain members.(Reporting by Adwitiya Srivastava in Bengaluru; Editing by Varun H K and Savio D'Souza)"

As a result, its results for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 will exceed market expectations, the Sedgefield, England-based company said.The shares rallied as much as 15% on Monday to the highest since May 2008. The stock has soared almost 700% in the past two years, giving it a market capitalization of 229 million ($284 million) and making it the best performer on Londons FTSE AIM All Share Index over that period.Filtronic signed a five-year strategic partnership with SpaceX in April last year, providing the Starlink constellation of satellites with ground-based modules that amplify radio frequency signals.Satellite internet services like Starlink are becoming more important as they can provide high-speed connectivity to places that are underserved by traditional internet providers, such as rural communities, conflict zones or areas where infrastructure has been damaged by natural disasters.Before Monday, Filtronic had already received three batches of orders from SpaceX, totaling $37.1 million. It has also issued warrants for the space technology company to take a maximum 10% stake.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Filtronic provided parts to cellular phone makers including Nokia Oyj and Motorola Inc. Once a FTSE 250 company, Filtronics market value peaked at 1.63 billion ($2 billion) in 2000. But in the two decades following the dotcom crash, the stock struggled to regain its footing, with market capitalization falling as low as 6.3 million at one point in 2015.

        "source": "Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "A version of this post first appeared on TKer.coDespite the looming threat of tariffs, the stock market continues to trade near record highs.This is a bit confounding since tariffs would be bad for earnings, and earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.Perhaps the market is betting that any tariffs will either be short-lived or less burdensome than feared.As we discussed on Monday, the effects of new tariffs on goods imported from Mexico, Canada, and China have not been factored into a lot of companies earnings guidance.While the tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been delayed for a month, they very much remain on the table. So investors should be aware of their potential consequences.Unfortunately, their consequences go beyond just the direct effects of higher costs on production and higher prices on demand. This makes estimating their full impact on earnings difficult to pinpoint.\"We estimate that every 5pp increase in the U.S. tariff rate would reduce S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1-2%,\" Goldmans Kostin said. \"As a result, if sustained, the tariffs announced [on February 1] would reduce our S&P 500 EPS forecasts by roughly 2-3%, not taking into account any additional impact from major financial conditions tightening or a larger-than-expected effect of policy uncertainty on corporate or consumer behavior.\"BofAs Savita Subramanian estimates: \"China+Canada+Mexico tariffs could be as much as an 8% hit to EPS.\"According to FactSet, analysts estimate S&P 500 EPS will grow 13.0% to $272 in 2025 and 13.8% to $309 in 2026. So the announced tariffs could have a meaningful impact on earnings. And keep in mind that President Trump has discussed imposing tariffs beyond whats been announced.\"We estimate that the current tariffs explicitly mentioned could result in an EPS headwind from first order effects of $7.50, $6.10 and $2.60 from Mexico, Canada and China tariffs, respectively,\" JPMorgans Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote. \"If we were to presume that Europe would face a 10% tariff, that would be another $3.60. In short, this could impact up to 2/3 of S&P 500 EPS growth this year from just the currently announced tariffs.\"Even if tariffs ultimately arent imposed, the uncertainty and volatility caused by the threat of tariffs could prove costly. Among other things, its already affecting how importers time their purchases, which can come with higher storage costs and increased risk of inventory held or sold at a loss.For now, earnings continue to perform remarkably well.Nearly two thirds of the S&P 500 companies have reported Q4 earnings. According to FactSet, EPS growth is on track to grow by 16.4% year-over-year, the highest growth rate since Q4 2021. This is significantly higher than the 11.8% growth expected by analysts at the beginning of the year.If this pattern of better-than-expected earnings were to continue  which by the way is one of the most consistent trends in stock market history  then its possible that the downside of any tariffs could be at least partially offset by what would be upside surprises in reported earnings.As I laid out in TKer Stock Market Truth No. 5: \"News about the economy or policy moves markets to the degree they are expected to impact earnings. Earnings (a.k.a. profits) are why you invest in companies.\"As TKer readers understand, earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. Earnings and prices have one of the tightest correlations of any two variables in markets.Goldman Sachs explained: \"The close relationship between the economy and market performance is largely driven by earnings. Because corporations are paid in nominal dollars, their sales and earnings tend to track nominal GDP growth over time. Rising sales typically boost profit margins as well, since companies often have some fixed costs that do not scale with higher revenues. As a result, margins historically expanded about two-thirds of the time during past periods with positive sales growth. ... Given these linkages, the S&P 500 has closely followed the path of earnings over time. Even with significant expansion in the P/E ratio over the last decade, earnings and dividends still contributed three-fourths of the S&P 500s total return.\"That last point is an important one. As much as we all obsess over P/E ratios, the dominant driver of prices has been earnings not valuations. (Indeed, in the Feb. 07, 2024 TKer, I said that moves in the P/E ratio just reflect the margin of error in what is a very tight relationship between prices and earnings.)And by the way, earnings explain why U.S. stocks have smoked non-U.S. stocks.\"The growing dominance of the US equity market has simply mirrored its relative profit growth since the financial crisis,\" Goldman Sachs Peter Oppenheimer wrote.Its worth stating that tariffs also hurt the countries on which tariffs are being imposed.If the trajectory of earnings were to shift due to tariffs, we should expect prices to follow.Because tariffs are almost universally considered negative for all of the economies involved, their implementation would mean earnings estimates will come down.For now, most companies and analysts appear to be waiting for something firm before they make any revisions.The stock market, meanwhile, continues to trade near all-time highs. This seems to reflect investors and traders wagering that new tariffs either wont come to fruition or they will be benign.Maybe the market is right to be trading high, and maybe companies and analysts wont have to cut their earnings estimates. After all, theres a case to be made that policymakers dont want to tank the stock market.In any case: Investing in the stock market would be a whole lot easier if we knew what was to come.There were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:The labor market continues to add jobs. According to the BLSs Employment Situation report released Friday, U.S. employers added 143,000 jobs in January. The report reflected the 49th straight month of gains, reaffirming an economy with growing demand for labor.Total payroll employment is at a record 159.1 million jobs, up 6.8 million from the prepandemic high.The unemployment rate  that is, the number of workers who identify as unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force  ticked down to 4.0% during the month. While it continues to hover near 50-year lows, the metric is near its highest level since October 2021.While the major metrics continue to reflect job growth and low unemployment, the labor market isnt as hot as it used to be.Wage growth ticks higher. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.48% month-over-month in January, up from the 0.25% pace in December. On a year-over-year basis, this metric is up 4.1%.Job openings fall. According to the BLSs Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, employers had 7.6 million job openings in December, down from 8.16 million in November.During the period, there were 6.88 million unemployed people  meaning there were 1.1 job openings per unemployed person. This continues to be one of the more obvious signs of excess demand for labor. However, this metric has returned to prepandemic levels.Layoffs remain depressed, hiring remains firm. Employers laid off 1.77 million people in December. While challenging for all those affected, this figure represents just 1.1% of total employment. This metric remains at pre-pandemic levels.Hiring activity continues to be much higher than layoff activity. During the month, employers hired 5.46 million people.That said, the hiring rate  the number of hires as a percentage of the employed workforce  has been trending lower, which could be a sign of trouble to come in the labor market.People are quitting less. In December, 3.2 million workers quit their jobs. This represents 2% of the workforce. While the rate ticked up last month, it continues to trend below prepandemic levels.A low quits rate could mean a number of things: more people are satisfied with their job; workers have fewer outside job opportunities; wage growth is cooling; productivity will improve as fewer people are entering new unfamiliar roles.Labor productivity inches up. From the BLS: \"Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024 ... as output increased 2.3% and hours worked increased 1.0%. (All quarterly percent changes in this release are seasonally adjusted annualized rates.) From the same quarter a year ago, nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Annual average productivity increased 2.3% from 2023 to 2024.\"Unemployment claims tick up. Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 219,000 during the week ending February 1, up from 208,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth.Job switchers still get better pay. According to ADP, which tracks private payrolls and employs a different methodology than the BLS, annual pay growth in January for people who changed jobs was up 6.8% from a year ago. For those who stayed at their job, pay growth was 4.7%Consumer vibes deteriorate. From the University of Michigans February Surveys of Consumers: \"Consumer sentiment fell for the second straight month, dropping about 5% to reach its lowest reading since July 2024. The decrease was pervasive, with Republicans, Independents, and Democrats all posting sentiment declines from January, along with consumers across age and wealth groups. Furthermore, all five index components deteriorated this month, led by a 12% slide in buying conditions for durables, in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy.\"Relatively weak consumer sentiment readings appear to contradict resilient consumer spending data.Politics clearly plays a role in peoples perception of the economy. Notably, expectations for inflation appear to be a partisan matter.Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: \"As of 31 Jan 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 2.7% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 31 Jan 2025, our estimate of the US Census January control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.54%.\"From BofA: \"Total card spending per HH was up 0.9% y/y in the week ending Feb 1, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Spending in the South seems to have recovered from the snowstorms driven decline we saw in the last month. Within sectors we report, online electronics saw the biggest y/y rise since last week & lodging saw the biggest decline.\"Gas prices tick up. From AAA: \"Amid the threat of tariffs, the national average for a gallon of gas ticked up two cents from last week to $3.13. According to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), gasoline demand increased from 8.30 million b/d last week to 8.32. Total domestic gasoline supply rose from 248.9 million barrels to 251.1, while gasoline production decreased last week, averaging 9.2 million barrels per day.\"Supply chain pressures remain loose. The New York Feds Global Supply Chain Pressure Index  a composite of various supply chain indicators  ticked lower in January and remains near historically normal levels. It's way down from its December 2021 supply chain crisis high.Business investment activity trends at record levels. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft  a.k.a. core capex or business investment  increased 0.4% to $74.7 billion in December.Core capex orders are a leading indicator, meaning they foretell economic activity down the road. While the growth rate has leveled off a bit, they continue to signal economic strength in the months to come.Services surveys signal growth. From S&P Globals January U.S. Service PMI: \"Service sector businesses reported a slowdown at the start of 2025, with activity levels growing at a reduced pace compared to the robust gains seen late last year. ... However, at least some of this cooling off seems to be related to disruptions caused by unusually adverse weather, hinting that growth in the services sector could revive in February. A marked upturn in hiring further supports the view that robust growth should resume.\"The ISMs January Services PMI made a similar move.Manufacturing surveys improved. From S&P Globals January U.S. Manufacturing PMI: \"A new year and a new President has brought new optimism in the US manufacturing sector. Business confidence about prospects for the year ahead has leaped to the highest for nearly three years after one of the largest monthly gains yet recorded by the survey. Over the past decade, only two months during the reopening of the economy from pandemic lockdowns have seen business sentiment improve as markedly as recorded in January.\"The ISM Manufacturing PMI improved and signaled growth in January for the first time since 2022.Keep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.Construction spending ticks higher. Construction spending increased 0.5% to an annual rate of $2.19 trillion in December.Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.89% from 6.95% last week. From Freddie Mac: \"Mortgage rates have been stable over the last month and incoming data suggest the economy remains on firm footing. Even though rates are higher compared to last year, the last two weeks of purchase applications are modestly above what was seen a year ago, indicating some latent demand in the market.\"There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million (or 40%) of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates.Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: \"Peak day office occupancy was 63.4% on Tuesday last week, up 18 points from the previous week as many workers returned to the office. Houston and Austin experienced the greatest increases, rising more than 70 points to 74.8% and more than 50 points to 68.3%, respectively. Other significant changes included Chicago, up nearly 28 points to 70.4%, and Washington, D.C., up more than 10 points to 61.7%. The average low was on Friday at 36.7%, up 2.3 points from last week.\"Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Feds GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.9% rate in Q1.The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.Demand for goods and services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less \"coiled\" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded.To be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve  having resolved the inflation crisis  has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investors perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth  in the cooling economy  is translating to robust earnings growth.Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about  such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.Theres also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.For now, theres no reason to believe therell be a challenge that the economy and the markets wont be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and its a streak long-term investors can expect to continue."

Read on for a snapshot of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.CD rates have remained high by historical standards, especially for shorter terms. For example, it's possible to find rates of 4.00% APY or higher for terms of about one year and under. Although interest rates for longer-term CDs aren't quite as high, the best available rates still hover near 3%-4% APY for terms of three years or more.Today, the highest CD rate 4.35% APY, offered by LendingClub on its 10-month CD. A minimum opening deposit of $2,500 is required.Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:This embedded content is not available in your region.See our picks for the best CD accounts available today>>CD rates are tied to the federal funds rate; when the Fed increases its target rate, deposit account rates usually follow suit, and vice versa.The Fed held interest rates steady for most of 2024, with a target rate of 5.25%-5.50%. However, as inflation cooled and economic growth improved, it finally slashed the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September, and another 25 basis points in November and December. Today, the federal funds rate stands at 4.25%-4.75%. Experts believe there will be additional rate cuts in 2025.As a result, CD rates have begun falling. That means now might be the last chance for savers to lock in todays higher CD rates.Read more: APY vs. interest rate: Whats the difference?Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on several factors. Earning a competitive interest rate is important, but its not the only consideration to keep in mind. Heres a closer look at some of these key factors to think about:Interest rates: CDs make for a more attractive investment option when interest rates are high or trending downward since they lock in the current rate for the entire term. Considering the recent trends in interest rates, it could be a good time to put your money in a CD and secure a guaranteed rate of return.Financial goals: CDs are a safe investment choice if you're looking to preserve capital and earn a steady return. They are insured by the FDIC up to the federal limit and cant lose money in most cases, making them a low-risk option. That said, if youre saving for a long-term goal like retirement, a CD may not be the best choice since market investments tend to provide higher returns, on average.Liquidity needs: CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term. If you think youll need to access your money before the term ends, you may want to avoid CDs, as they come with early withdrawal penalties. A high-yield savings account or other type of deposit account may be a better option.Read more: How much do you need to open a CD?CDs are available from most banks. However, if youre interested in opening a CD, its important to look beyond your current bank. Not all CDs offer competitive rates, even in a high interest rate environment. Thats why comparing multiple CD account options is important, especially among financial institutions that are known for offering higher rates.Online banks: One of the best places to find high-yield CDs is online banks. Since they are less expensive to operate than traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks can pass on those savings to customers in the form of lower fees and higher rates on deposits. So, if youre interested in opening a CD with a high rate, online institutions are a great place to start.Credit unions: As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions tend to offer better rates and lower fees than for-profit banks. Research the local credit unions in your area, as well as online credit unions, and find out if you qualify to join any.Community banks: Local banks strive to serve their communities and often provide more affordable and personalized service than large, national banks. They also typically offer more competitive interest rates on deposits.Read more: Can you gift a CD?This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "Are you looking to invest at least six figures in a certificate of deposit (CD)? Your search for the right CD might lead you to consider jumbo CDs or a similar  but less common  product called negotiable CDs (NCDs).While a negotiable CD can look like an attractive option for large deposits, it's not likely to be your best choice. Why? First, you'll be hard-pressed to find a bank that still offers NCDs to individuals. Second, these CDs are often sold in denominations of $1 million, so they're mainly for institutions.If you have the money to invest in an NCD, you might appreciate two features: You can sell these CDs before they mature and potentially negotiate your rate and other terms.This embedded content is not available in your region.Negotiable CDs have a few characteristics in common with traditional, nonnegotiable CDs, but they're also distinct. With both types of CDs, you agree to deposit a set amount of money in return for guaranteed interest. Both are also low risk and come with FDIC insurance up to $250,000.But when you look beyond the basics, NCDs have quite a few of their own unique features:Issuance: They're only issued by certain types of financial institutions, including national and state-chartered banks, savings associations, and state and federal credit unions.Rates: Interest can be fixed or variable, and rates are close to what you might earn on a Treasury bill. Rates are mainly determined by market forces, but sometimes, you can negotiate them with the issuer.Negotiation: You can potentially negotiate the CD term and the frequency you receive interest payments. You may also be able to negotiate a higher interest rate based on competitor's rates or by promising to make additional deposits with the issuer.Terms: The terms usually range from one month to one year, with the average maturity currently at just two weeks. You can't cash out an NCD before maturity, but you can sell it to other investors on the secondary market.Amounts: The minimum amount you need to deposit in order to open an NCD is $100,000.Payments: Interest is usually paid out at maturity; if the term is longer than one year, it's paid semi-annually. If you sell the CD, payment is due when the order is made.Read more: CDs vs. Treasury bills: Maximizing your savingsVery few retail banks offer negotiable CDs to individual investors, but you may be able to find an NCD at a national or state-chartered bank, a savings association, or a state or federal credit union.For example, the only negotiable CD we could find was from Ascend Federal Credit Union, which offers negotiable rates on six- to 24-month CDs when you deposit a minimum of $500,000.Even if you can find an NCD to invest in, it's not likely to be your best choice.Unlike traditional CDs, the rates on NCDs can be variable, meaning they fluctuate with the market. If your rate increases, the issuer may be able to \"call\" the CD, meaning they can terminate the account early. If rates decrease, you might be tempted to sell on the secondary market, but you'll have to list the CD at a discount and take a loss.On top of that, FDIC insurance is limited to $250,000, so it's risky to invest more than that dollar amount into an NCD.Read more: What is a callable CD?Fortunately, NCDs aren't the only investment accounts that let you earn competitive interest rates on your short- and mid-term savings. Instead of investing in an NCD, consider one of these alternatives:Treasury bills: Investing in T-bills is safer than CDs since every dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. That means you don't have to worry about losing money if the bank fails, and you don't have to worry about being insured past $250,000.Jumbo CD: Look for a jumbo CD that comes with a fixed interest rate and isn't callable. With this option, you lock in a guaranteed rate for the full term of the CD.Brokered CDs: If you want the opportunity to sell your CD before it matures, look into brokered CDs, which can be bought and potentially sold on the secondary market. They do have several drawbacks, however, including the fact that they earn simple interest instead of compound interest and they're not always FDIC-insured.Not all jumbo CDs are negotiable, but most of them are.There aren't many banks that offer negotiable CDs for individual investors. You may be able to find one at a national or state-chartered bank or at a state or federal credit union.You might be able to negotiate a higher interest rate on a negotiable CD by showing the issuer that their competitor offers higher rates.Read more: Can you negotiate a higher savings account rate with your bank?"

Sovereign bonds are debt securities issued by national governments and are typically seen as safe investments, especially those from economically stable countries. They provide fixed income returns, making them attractive for conservative investors looking to diversify their portfolios. If youre considering sovereign bonds, a financial advisor can help you choose options that align with your financial objectives.Sovereign bonds are government-issued debt instruments used to fund infrastructure projects, public services or debt refinancing. These bonds are backed by the creditworthiness of the issuing government, and their reliability often depends on the country's economic and political stability. Investors purchase sovereign bonds in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of their principal at maturity.For example, U.S. Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and are considered one of the safest investments due to the backing of the U.S. government. Similarly, countries like Germany and Japan also issue sovereign bonds like Bunds and JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds), respectively. Sovereign bonds are available in various maturities, ranging from short-term bills to long-term bonds.Sovereign bonds operate on a simple principle: The government borrows money from investors and agrees to pay it back with interest over a specified period. Here's how they typically work:Issuance: Governments issue sovereign bonds in domestic or international markets. Bonds sold in the domestic market are usually denominated in the local currency, while those sold internationally may be denominated in major currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro.Coupon payments: Investors receive periodic interest payments, known as coupons, based on a fixed or floating rate specified at issuance. These payments provide a steady income stream for the bondholder.Maturity: At the bond's maturity date, the government repays the principal amount to the investor.For example, suppose the U.K. government issues a 10-year sovereign bond with a 3% annual coupon rate. An investor purchasing 10,000 worth of these bonds would receive 300 annually in interest payments. Upon maturity, the investor would receive the original 10,000 principal.Sovereign bonds are typically issued in different denominations, depending on the market and the investor base that the government aims to target. These denominations can influence accessibility and investment preferences. Here are four to consider:Local currency bonds: These are denominated in the currency of the issuing country. For instance, India issues sovereign bonds in Indian rupees, primarily targeting domestic investors.Foreign currency bonds: Some governments issue bonds in major foreign currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro or yen. These foreign bonds are often aimed at international investors seeking exposure to the issuing country's credit without local currency risk.Panda and Samurai bonds: These are specific examples of foreign currency bonds. Panda bonds are issued in Chinese yuan by foreign entities, while Samurai bonds are issued in Japanese yen.Retail bonds: Some governments offer smaller-denomination bonds to attract individual investors. For example, U.S. Treasury savings bonds are designed for retail investors, with lower minimum purchase requirements.If you want to invest in sovereign bonds, here are five general steps to help you get started:Research the issuer: Evaluate the creditworthiness of the issuing government by reviewing its credit rating and economic stability. Agencies like Moody's, S&P and Fitch provide sovereign credit ratings.Choose the market: Decide whether to invest in domestic or international sovereign bonds. International bonds may offer higher yields but come with currency risks.Select the type of bond: Determine whether you prefer long-term bonds for stable returns or short-term bills for liquidity. Consider coupon rates and maturity periods.Open an investment account: Use a brokerage account or work with a financial advisor to access sovereign bonds. Some bonds, like U.S. Treasuries, can be purchased directly through government websites.Monitor your investments: Keep track of interest payments, maturity dates and market conditions to ensure your investment aligns with your financial goals.There are several ways to invest in sovereign bonds. Whether you're buying directly, through funds, or on the secondary market, here are three common options to help you make a choice:Direct purchases: You can buy sovereign bonds directly from the issuing government or through a primary dealer. This method allows you to purchase bonds right at their initial offering.Bond funds: Consider investing in bond funds like ETFs or mutual funds that contain a mix of sovereign bonds. This option provides diversification, spreading out potential risks across various bonds.Secondary market: Another way to invest is by buying sovereign bonds from other investors on the secondary market. This allows you to purchase bonds that are already in circulation.Sovereign bonds are key to conservative investment strategies, providing stable returns and diversification. By learning about their structure, denominations, and risks, you can make choices that fit your financial goals.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds three times in 2024. As a result, deposit account rates are on the decline.The good news: You can lock in a competitive return on a certificate of deposit (CD) today and preserve your earning power. In fact, the best CDs still pay rates above 4%. Read on for a snapshot of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.CDs today typically offer rates significantly higher than traditional savings accounts. As of February, the best short-term CDs (six to 12 months) generally offer rates around 4.00% to 4.50% APY.Today, the highest CD rate 4.35% APY, offered by two banks: Synchrony Bank (13-month CD) and LendingClub (10-month CD).The following is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners.This embedded content is not available in your region.See our picks for the best CD accounts and rates>>The 2000s were marked by the dot-com bubble and later, the global financial crisis of 2008. Though the early 2000s saw relatively higher CD rates, they began to fall as the economy slowed and the Federal Reserve cut its target rate to stimulate growth. By 2009, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the average one-year CD paid around 1% APY, with five-year CDs at less than 2% APY.The trend of falling CD rates continued into the 2010s, especially after the Great Recession of 2007-2009. The Fed's policies to stimulate the economy (in particular, its decision to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero) led banks to offer very low rates on CDs. By 2013, average rates on 6-month CDs fell to about 0.1% APY, while 5-year CDs returned an average of 0.8% APY.However, things changed between 2015 and 2018, when the Fed started gradually increasing rates again. At this point, there was a slight improvement in CD rates as the economy expanded, marking the end of nearly a decade of ultra-low rates. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led to emergency rate cuts by the Fed, causing CD rates to fall to new record lows.The situation reversed following the pandemic as inflation began to spiral out of control. This prompted the Fed to hike rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023. In turn, this led to higher rates on loans and higher APYs on savings products, including CDs.Fast forward to September 2024  the Fed finally decided to start cutting the federal funds rate after it determined that inflation was essentially under control. Today, we're beginning to see CD rates come down from their peak. Even so, CD rates remain high by historical standards.Take a look at how CD rates have changed since 2009:Traditionally, longer-term CDs have offered higher interest rates compared to shorter-term CDs. This is because locking in money for a longer period typically carries more risk (namely, missing out on higher rates in the future), which banks compensate for with higher rates.However, this pattern doesnt necessarily hold today; the highest average CD rate is for a 12-month term. This indicates a flattening or inversion of the yield curve, which can happen in uncertain economic times or when investors expect future interest rates to decline.Read more: Short- or long-term CD: Which is best for you?When opening a CD, choosing one with a high APY is just one piece of the puzzle. There are other factors that can impact whether a particular CD is best for your needs and your overall return. Consider the following when choosing a CD:Your goals: Decide how long you're willing to lock away your funds. CDs come with fixed terms, and withdrawing your money before the term ends can result in penalties. Common terms range from a few months up to several years. The right term for you depends on when you anticipate needing access to your money.Type of financial institution: Rates can vary significantly among financial institutions. Don't just check with your current bank; research CD rates from online banks, local banks, and credit unions. Online banks, in particular, often offer higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks because they have lower overhead costs. However, make sure any online bank you consider is FDIC-insured (or NCUA-insured for credit unions).Account terms: Beyond the interest rate, understand the terms of the CD, including the maturity date and withdrawal penalties. Also, check if there's a minimum deposit requirement and if so, that fits your budget.Inflation: While CDs can offer safe, fixed returns, they might not always keep pace with inflation, especially for longer terms. Consider this when deciding on the term and amount to invest."

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. An employer match is one of the most valuable features of many 401(k) plans. Even without an employer match of your contributions, however, a 401(k) can still be useful for retirement savings. The tax-deferred growth and the potential for disciplined, automatic contributions make it an option worth considering. If your 401(k) plan doesn't match your contributions, deciding whether to contribute involves weighing factors such as alternative investment opportunities and the broader role your 401(k) might play in your overall retirement strategy.Talk your financial objectives over with a financial advisor to develop a retirement savings strategy.An employer 401(k) match is a financial contribution made by the employer to an employees retirement account. It is typically based on the employee's own contributions. Employer matching can be a powerful incentive to save because it effectively offers free money to employees who elect to participate.Matches are often structured as a percentage of the employee's salary, with a cap. For example, an employer might match 50% of the first 6% of the employee's salary that the employee contributes. This means if you contribute 6% of your salary, the employer adds an amount equal to 3% of your salary to your 401(k). If you contribute more than 6%, there will be no matching contribution, however.In addition to matching only a portion of the employee contributions, these contributions often come with other limitations. For example, employees often don't immediately have full ownership of employer matching contributions. Vesting schedules determine when employees gain full ownership of matched funds. Vesting periods can range from immediate to several years and understanding the match formula and vesting requirements is key to maximizing the value of an employer-sponsored 401(k).Another benefit of employer matching is that employer contributions don't count against the cap on 401(k) contributions by the employee. For 2025, this limit is $23,500. The cap on total 401(k) contributions including employee and employer contributions still applies, however. For 2025, this cap is $70,000.These plans also offer other benefits, such as tax benefits and long-term investment growth. These advantages can still make it worthwhile to contribute without additional employer contributions.Even without an employer match, a 401(k) can still be a valuable tool for retirement savings, offering tax advantages, convenience and opportunities for disciplined investing. Here are seven key reasons to consider contributing regardless of whether your employer offers matching contributions:Tax-deferred growth: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, and investment earnings grow tax-free until withdrawal.Automatic payroll deductions: Consistent, automated contributions help establish disciplined saving habits with minimal effort.Diverse investment options: 401(k) plans often provide access to professionally managed funds, such as low-cost index funds and target-date funds, simplifying investment choices.Tax planning benefits: For higher earners, contributing can help reduce taxable income, potentially keeping you in a lower tax bracket.Long-term savings strategy: Even without matching, the tax advantages and compounding growth of a 401(k) can significantly boost your retirement savings over time.Higher contribution limits: Even without a company match, a 401(k) offers higher contribution limits when compared with individual retirement accounts (IRAs). The IRS lets you contribute up to $23,500 to a 401(k) in 2025, plus another $7,500 if you're 50 or older.Super catch-up contributions: Savers between ages 60 and 63 can save an extra $11,250 in a 401(k)  for a total of $34,750  thanks to a provision of SECURE Act 2.0.If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k) match, exploring alternative retirement savings options can help you maximize your investment potential. Here are three common alternatives and their benefits compared with making contributions to a non-matching 401(k):Individual retirement accounts (IRAs): Traditional and Roth IRAs provide tax advantages and often come with more investment choices than a 401(k). A Roth IRA, for example, allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a compelling option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. For 2025, you can contribute up to $7,000 to an IRA if you are younger than 50, and up to $8,000 if you are 50 or older.Health savings accounts (HSAs): If you have a high-deductible health plan, an HSA offers triple tax benefits: tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. Unused funds can even be used for retirement after age 65. For 2025, you can contribute up to $4,300 to an HSA and $8,550 as a family.Taxable investment accounts: While these accounts don't offer tax advantages, they provide unlimited contribution amounts and complete flexibility in investment choices and withdrawal timing, making them a useful supplement to retirement savings.While some companies may choose to temporarily curtail or eliminate their 401(k) matching contributions in response to economic uncertainty or lagging performance, the overall data does not seem to support a significant trend toward eliminating 401(k) matches.According to the most recently published \"BrightScope/ICI Defined Contribution Plan Profile: A Close Look at 401(k) Plans report from 2021, nearly nine out of 10 large 401(k) plans  those with at least 100 participants  offered employer contributions in 2021. This figure hasn't changed much in recent years.The percentage of all 401(k) plans with employer contributions did decline noticeably from 78% in 2008 to 72% in 2011. However, that number has since rebounded, reaching 81% in 2021, according to the BrightScope/ICI report released in August 2024.Furthermore, 90% of all 401(k) participants in 2021 were enrolled in a plan that included company contributions. Meanwhile, 97% of the largest 401(k) plans (those with more than $1 billion in assets) included employer contributions in 2021  up from 91% in 2007, the same report found.This consistency suggests that the 401(k) no matching trend is not widespread among large employers. In fact, a large majority of participants in these plans continue to benefit from employer contributions, indicating that matching remains a common feature in 401(k) offerings.Choosing whether to contribute to a 401(k) without a matching benefit depends on individual financial goals and circumstances, but the plan's tax advantages and simplicity often make it a compelling option. Alternatives like IRAs, HSAs and taxable investment accounts can complement or replace a 401(k) in certain scenarios, offering flexibility and unique benefits. While employer matching remains prevalent, exploring a diverse range of savings strategies ensures a well-rounded approach to building retirement wealth.A financial advisor can help you mitigate risk for your portfolio.

        "content": "Managing cash flow is one of the biggest challenges for owner-operators and fleets. Between fuel, maintenance, insurance, and payroll, expenses can pile up quickly, often before the revenue from completed load invoices comes in. Thats where net 30 fleet fuel cards come into play. These cards provide structured fuel expense management by giving fleets and fleet owners 30 days to pay their fuel bill in full  basically, short-term financing to bridge the gap between operating costs and receivables.A fuel card with net 30 terms can be a game changer for operators running on tight margins, but understanding how it works and its advantages and risks is crucial to using it effectively.Net 30 terms mean payment is due in full 30 days after the invoice date. For fuel cards, owner-operators and fleet managers can purchase fuel throughout a billing cycle, receive a consolidated invoice at the end, and then have 30 days to pay the balance.Not all net 30 fuel cards are the same in how they operate or in the benefits they provide. Some count the 30 days from the date of each purchase, whereas others start the clock from the invoice date at the end of the billing cycle. Understanding terms is key to making timely payments to avoid penalties or negative impacts on credit.Billing cycles can also vary. Some fleet cards operate on a calendar-month cycle, meaning all purchases made from the first to the last day of the month are included in one invoice. Others use a mid-month cycle, such as running from the 15th of one month to the 15th of the next. Reviewing a cards specific terms before signing up ensures no surprises when payments come due.Net 30 terms count all calendar days, not just business days. This means weekends and holidays are included in the 30 days. Most fleet fuel cards outline the specific due date on the invoice, so theres no guesswork. If the due date lands on a holiday or weekend, check the card providers policy because some may extend the deadline to the next business day, and others may not.When Should You Pay Your Net 30 Account? The best strategy is to pay as soon as possible, especially if theres a risk of missing the deadline. Many owner-operators and small fleet owners wait for customer payments to roll in before covering fuel costs, but waiting too long can be risky.Missing a payment can damage business credit, making it harder to secure future financing or other credit lines. Fleet cards also charge hefty late fees if payments arent made on time. To avoid issues, many owner-operators set reminders for payment deadlines or automate payments through their accounting system.That said, strategic credit use can help build a business credit profile. Keeping a net 30 account in good standing shows lenders and credit bureaus that a trucking business can manage financial obligations, which may help secure better financing options in the future.Still unclear how a net 30 fuel card works? Heres a real-world example:July 16  A driver uses a fleet fuel card for fuel.July 31  The driver receives an invoice for all fuel purchases made during July.Aug. 30  The payment is due in full (30 days after the invoice date).New transactions made between July 31 and Aug. 30 wont be due until the next billing cycle, meaning those purchases will be due on Sept. 30. This rolling structure allows fleet owners to align expenses with incoming revenue, creating more flexibility in cash flow.Advantages of net 30 Fleet Fuel CardsA fuel card with net 30 terms can provide numerous benefits, including:Better cash flow management  allows time to receive payments before paying for fuel expenses.Simplified bookkeeping  consolidates fuel expenses into a single payment.Business credit building  on-time payments can improve creditworthiness and lead to better financing opportunities.Flexible payment timing  helps owner-operators align payments with their invoicing cycles, especially if customers pay on net 10 or net 15 terms.Reduced financial strain  provides a cushion between operating costs and revenue collection.For growing trucking businesses, these benefits might mean the difference between keeping trucks moving and scrambling to cover fuel costs at the last minute.Disadvantages of net 30 Fleet Fuel CardsWhile these cards offer flexibility, they also come with some potential downsides:Longer payment periods require discipline. If this is not properly managed, losing track of upcoming due dates can be easy.Late payments come with fees. Many providers charge penalties for missed or late payments, which reduces profitability.Cards can complicate accounting. Businesses using multiple cards with different terms may find it challenging to keep track of payment cycles.Owner-operators and fleet owners must adhere to their payment schedules to avoid unnecessary fees and maintain financial stability.Key Considerations When Choosing a net 30 Fleet CardBefore committing to a fleet card with net 30 terms, there are a few important factors to think about:1. Meeting Payment Due DatesWhile net 30 cards offer a buffer, consistent on-time payments are a must. Failure to pay on time can negatively impact business credit and lead to even more costs. Before signing up for a card, look at your cash flow to ensure you can meet due dates.2. Late Payment FeesEvery fleet card vendor has different late fee terms. Some charge a percentage of the overdue balance, while others impose flat-rate penalties. Fees can be as high as 10% per month on overdue balances, making understanding the financial consequences of missing a payment critical.3. Minimum Payment RequirementsSome fuel cards require a minimum monthly payment, even if the balance isnt due. Failure to meet the minimum might result in additional fees and penalties. Reviewing these terms before applying can prevent unexpected financial burdens down the road.A Smart Cash Flow Tool for Owner-operatorsFor owner-operators and fleet managers, a net 30 fuel card is a financial tool for managing operating expenses while waiting for payments. By giving fleets a predictable payment structure, these cards ensure that fuel costs dont become a financial burden.Like any credit tool, net 30 terms require careful management. Late payments can be costly, and missing due dates can hurt business credit. Owner-operators who use these cards, make timely payments and align expenses with invoicing cycles can take full advantage of the benefits without falling into the debt trap.Whether you run a single truck or manage a small fleet, its essential to select the right fuel card with terms that align with your business cash flow needs. Understanding the fine print, setting up payment reminders and staying proactive with financial planning will ensure that your net 30 fuel cards remain an asset rather than a liability.The post Understanding Net 30 Terms for Fleet Fuel Cards appeared first on FreightWaves."

State insurers and mutual funds have been asked to pump billions of dollars that could prop up the stock market.\"I understand why they're doing this right now,\" said Francis Tan, chief Asia strategist at CA Indosuez.\"If you can fix the asset prices, confidence will be up and when the confidence will be up, there'll be real economic demand and then we'll see economic growth. So they're coming in from the asset price angle to fix sentiment. They are now trying to start a virtuous cycle,\" he said.The world's second-largest economy is in desperate need of a feel-good factor as deepening deflation, a slump in property values, government debt problems and, more recently, a fresh trade war with the United States sap sentiment.Regulators have touted the idea of luring more long-term investors into the retail-dominated stock market for more than a decade. But this time they have set specific targets.China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) head Wu Qing has said big state insurers are to invest 30% of their new policy premiums in China-listed shares and mutual funds to grow stock holdings by 10% a year for the next three years.Wu also expects insurers to channel at least 100 billion yuan ($13.8 billion) into stocks via a pilot scheme in the first half of this year.Mutual funds are scurrying to launch more equity investment offerings to comply with that directive. More than 100 equity funds are being marketed or in the sales pipeline, according to data provider East Money Information Co.The new rules are estimated to attract at least 1 trillion yuan ($138.1 billion) from insurers and mutual funds into domestic stocks each year, although that's a pittance for a $12 trillion market.BALLAST AND STABILISERWhile the measures have not yet spurred a market rally, they may over time attract more professional investors that become the 'ballast' and 'stabiliser' that CSRC's Wu hopes for.Four years into a bear market, the CSI 300 index trades where it did a decade ago. The total value of the market, dominated by small-cap firms favoured by retail investors and rife with pump-and-dump speculation, has not changed since 2015.Sat Duhra, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, believes China needs to address underlying macroeconomic issues for these efforts to have a lasting impact.\"If you go back over history and look at what was important for consumption in China, it was household income ... and that's employment. It was not equity market creating wealth effect and it was not interest rates,\" he said.Institutional investors own around 19% of tradable shares in China, dwarfed by retail traders who own 30%, according to Huaxi Securities. Individuals constitute 70% of daily turnover.Dong Baozhen, chairman of Beijing-based asset manager Lingtong Shengtai, says the measures are a \"way out\" for the fragile stock market.\"The cyclical boom and bust of Chinese shares over the past three decades was the result of pricing power resting in the wrong hands\", so the government has a strong political will to seize that power from speculators, he said.He reckons Beijing's carrot-and-stick approach will boost the clout of risk-averse insurers currently under-represented in the market, potentially benefiting stocks with high dividends, such as banks.Stock investments by insurers have already jumped by a third over the past four months to 4.4 trillion yuan under the government's push. That compares with roughly 7 trillion yuan of equity holdings by mutual funds.Still, some analysts question the wisdom of making long-term bets on a slowing economy facing persistent deflation, an aging population and geopolitical tensions.\"The core issue is not really the nature of the capital, it's the market environment,\" said Zhang Jianan, a self-employed stock trader.\"You've got public funds as potatoes, you've got insurance funds as roses. You sprinkle it in the soil and it will grow, but you sprinkle it in a shit hole and they will all die.\"($1 = 7.2440 Chinese yuan)(Reporting by Samuel Shen in Shanghai and Summer Zhen, Jiaxin Li in Hong Kong, Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)"

        "content": "If you were invested in stocks and stock mutual funds, 2024 was a charm.A strong economy, sliding inflation, and the Federal Reserves interest-rate cuts totalling one percentage point resulted in higher balances for many retirees investments.The S&P 500 ended the year with a gain of 23%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 13%, and the Nasdaq ballooned close to 29%.But how much of that will you get to keep? The dividends and capital gains you get from these investments do come with a tax bite.Meanwhile, Social Security recipients received a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 3.2% for 2024. That bump might just push you over the income threshold that makes your benefits taxable.Keeping more of your money in retirement is paramount, and tax time provides ways to protect and maximize your nest egg. Here are some basic ways to lower your tax liability for your 2024 return.Investing money in an individual retirement account reduces your taxable income, which in turn can mean a lower tax bill.If youre already taking your Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), new contributions can whittle down your taxable income.Even though youre retired, you or your spouse might have earned some money from a consulting, contract, or part-time gig last year. That means you may be able to make IRA contributions.Traditional IRA contributions are not limited by how much you make annually, meaning that anyone with earned income is eligible to participate, though your contribution may not be fully deductible. If you (or your spouse) are contributing to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the tax-deductible portion of your IRA contribution may be further trimmed.Meanwhile, there's no age restriction on making regular contributions to traditional IRAs.In general, you can continue contributing to a health savings account (HSA) as long as youre not yet enrolled in Medicare and are covered by a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). You can also open an account as a self-employed freelancer or business owner if you have a qualified HDHP.An HSA is the only account that allows you to put in money on a tax-free basis, builds that money up tax-free, and lets you take it out tax-free for qualified healthcare expenses.Just like IRAs, you can contribute to an HSA up until the April 15 tax deadline, and doing so reduces your taxable income.Most tax filers opt for the simplicity of taking the standard dedication and sparing themselves the headache of itemizing.For tax year 2024, the standard deduction is $29,200 for married couples filing jointly ($14,600 for single filers), so any itemized deductions above that amount would deliver a tax benefit. If youre 65 or older at the end of the tax year, you can save a hair more on your 2024 taxes by taking the extra standard deduction of $1,950 if you're single or file as head of household. If you file jointly, the bonus deduction is $1,550 for each spouse if youre both 65 or older.But taking the standard deduction is not always the best move. Common itemized deductions, such as charitable contributions, state taxes, and mortgage interest, can quickly add up. Take a look at your medical spending, Isaac Bradley, director of financial planning at Homrich Berg, told Yahoo Finance. Unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) can also be deducted.In fact, one of the most common sources of itemized expenses that exceed the standard deduction for retirees is unreimbursed healthcare expenses, he said.Learn more: Standardized vs. itemized: Which tax filing approach is right for you? You may qualify for a state tax deduction for contributions made to a 529 education account by April 15 in a few states  Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin, Bradley added.This could save a retiree a little in state taxes if you want to help kids or grandkids with school expenses, he said.For other states you need to get those accounts funded by Dec. 21 of the applicable tax year. For example, if youre the 529 account owner or a contributor, you can subtract up to $2,500 per beneficiary from your Maryland state income for contributions in that calendar year.Your state, county, or city might also offer income tax breaks or credits if youre 65 or older. Property tax breaks for older adults are available in some states.For example, in the District of Columbia, if you're 65 or older, the Senior Citizen Tax Relief reduces your annual real property taxes by 50%. You need to apply for this tax break and can contact your states tax agency or local tax office.If youre already retired, there are several ways to reduce your 2025 tax bill, but these strategies require planning throughout the year and now is the best time to start, Tamara Telesko, director of Wealth Planning Strategies at TIAA, told Yahoo Finance.If you turn 73 in 2025, you have until April 1, 2026, to take your first RMD. While deferring your first RMD to 2026 could lower your taxable income for 2025, it would mean taking two RMDs in 2026, potentially increasing your tax bill that year, she said.If youre 70 12 or older, dont have enough deductions to itemize, and are charitably inclined, a QCD could be a tax-efficient solution.This allows you to keep the benefits of the standard deduction while lowering taxable income  which could also potentially reduce taxes on your Social Security benefits and lower your Medicare premiums. A real win-win, Telesko said.For tax year 2025, a QCD allows you to donate up to $108,000 from your IRA directly to a qualified charity. The upside of this strategy is that while the amount you donate is not deductible as an itemized deduction, you dont have to pay federal taxes on the amount distributed to the charity. That donation counts toward the year's RMD. A number of states also permit taxpayers to deduct or receive a tax credit for qualified gifts to charity.One of the big things we see retirees miss tax opportunity-wise is choosing the right way to make a charitable donation, Howard Hook, senior wealth advisor at EKS Associates in Princeton, NJ, told Yahoo Finance. If done correctly, you can save a significant amount of taxes, he added.Kerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Questioning where to keep your retirement savings? With a volatile stock market, you may be wary of putting your hard-earned money into investments that can lose value. Meanwhile, a high-yield savings account (HYSA) can offer a safe, reliable return. Today, the best HYSAs pay above 4%.However, you could lose out in a big way if you go with a bank account over an employer-sponsored retirement account. Why? Even if you contribute to an HYSA with a competitive interest rate, your earnings won't match the average returns you get on a 401(k). Plus, you miss out on other benefits like the ability to reduce your tax bill.This embedded content is not available in your region.High-yield savings accounts and 401(k)s have very little in common since they're built to serve very different purposes. HYSAs are not built to hold retirement savings, but they are great for emergency savings since they give you:Quick access to your money when you need it.Higher interest rates than most other types of deposit accounts.FDIC insurance to protect you from losses.The main downside to keeping your long-term savings in an HYSA is that interest rates are variable. That means even if you start out with a rate as high as 4% to 5%, your rate could drop at any time. And historically speaking, HYSA rates don't keep pace with inflation.Read more: Are HYSAs less favorable when interest rates are low?For spare cash that you don't need access to in the next few years, a 401(k) is a much better choice. These accounts are specifically built to help you save for retirement, and average returns are much higher than savings accounts (which are further compounded by a long-term investing horizon).Yes, your 401(k) can lose money in a volatile year, but if you spread the money across different companies and sectors (also known as diversification) and you invest for the long term, your returns will easily beat what you earn on a savings account.Read more: What is a 401(k)? A guide to the rules and how it works.According to a 2024 report from Vanguard, 401(k)s and other defined contribution plans earned average returns of 9.7% from December 2019 to December 2023. By comparison, the best rates you could find on a HYSA in 2018 and 2019 were near 2% APY, and in 2020 it was near 1% APY.A high-yield savings account is not a substitute for a 401(k). Yes, you may be able to find accounts with 4% APY or more right now, but your rate can drop at any point in the future. And even if it remains high for a while, you can still earn more from a 401(k).Read more: 15 savings accounts with interest rates of 4% APY and higherFor example, let's say you contribute $200 a month to both types of accounts. If your HYSA consistently earns 4% APY, your account balance will hit $29,508 in 10 years.By comparison, a 401(k) that earns 7% will be worth $34,753 in 10 years. That's a difference of $5,245, and it doesn't take into consideration the other financial benefits you get from investing in a 401(k), like deferred taxes.Here are the main benefits you get from choosing a 401(k) over a high-yield savings account for your retirement savings:Higher average returns: It's difficult to beat the returns you earn on a 401(k), which can average up to 8%.Employer match: Your employer may match a portion of your contribution, which means you get free money invested into your account.Tax benefits: Your contributions can be deducted from your taxable income, resulting in a lower tax bill.That doesn't mean an HYSA is a bad choice. In fact, it's one of the best places you can deposit savings for an emergency fund and other short-term goals. It simply means that an HYSA is not the right account to help you reach your retirement goals.You should not make an early withdrawal from your 401(k) unless you're facing a financial emergency and have no other way to come up with the cash you need. If you do make an early withdrawal, you'll most likely have to pay income taxes on that amount, plus an additional 10% tax.If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k), check to see if they have another employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 403(b), 457(b), SEP, or SIMPLE IRA. If not, consider opening up a traditional IRA, since these retirement accounts offer similar tax benefits to traditional 401(k)s.After maxing out your 401(k) you might be tempted to turn to a HYSA or another bank account. Instead, consider a traditional IRA, since contributing can help you further reduce your taxable income.Read more: How much should I contribute to my 401(k)?"

        "content": "By Davide Barbuscia and Saqib Iqbal AhmedNEW YORK (Reuters) - Surprisingly strong U.S. inflation in January stoked investor fears that a heating economy and looming tariffs could corner the Federal Reserve, undercutting interest rate-cut hopes and even raising the threat of a hike.U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in January, reinforcing expectations the central bank will be in no rush to resume cutting interest rates, particularly as economic uncertainty is exacerbated by the expected inflationary impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on key U.S. trade partners.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony this week that the Fed was prepared to keep rates unchanged until inflation resumes its decline. But the hot inflation reading will likely complicate investors' efforts to game out when it may cut rates again, with some even starting to voice concerns that its next move may be a hike to contain price pressures, a shift that would rattle markets.\"We have to get comfortable with this idea that inflation is sticky at a higher level than what we were used to in the past,\" said Erik Aarts, senior fixed income strategist at Touchstone Investments.Aarts said he planned to maintain a slight \"underweight\" position on Treasuries, which rise in value when interest rates are set to decline. He remained bullish on corporate bonds, however, on expectations of continued economic strength.Interest rate future traders were betting on only one 25 basis point rate cut by the Fed later this year after the inflation data, down from about 36 basis points of expected easing in 2025 ahead of the release. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which reflect economic growth and inflation expectations, surged over 10 basis points and were last at 4.65%, their highest in almost three weeks.The benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell on Wednesday, as the inflation data upended expectations of broad support for equities from less restrictive monetary policy.\"Our base case was slowing growth, slowing inflation,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital.The possibility of rates staying high longer than expected meant large companies with big cash flows could become more attractive, while it could stop an investor shift away from the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks into the broader market.\"I'd love to see that broadening, but I think this is really a setback to that trend,\" Ablin said.TARIFFS BACKDROPTrump's protectionist policies exacerbated market fears of a sustained rebound in inflation, as he imposed a 10% additional tariff on Chinese goods while suspending 25% levies on goods from Canada and Mexico until March.\"Inflation acceleration is more concerning than usual right now,\" Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said in a note. \"The prospect of new trade barriers has the potential to further fuel inflationary pressures by increasing costs for businesses and consumers,\" he said.U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in February to a seven-month low and inflation expectations surged as households feared it may be too late to avoid the negative effects on their purchasing power from Trump's threatened tariffs, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers showed last week.\"The rise in inflation expectations that we've seen with consumers recently, combined with this hotter-than-expected January CPI report, certainly shifts some of the risks over to the inflation outlook,\" said Sam Millette, director of fixed income at Commonwealth Financial Network.\"Trying to forecast when the next rate change will be is extremely difficult, given some of the volatility that we have from Washington on the policy front.\"While he was not planning to tweak his portfolio based on the latest inflation reading, Millette said he had seen more interest from advisors in securities that would be expected to hold up well in a rising rate environment.Many in the market cautioned that seasonal effects could have worsened the January inflation reading, as companies typically raise prices at the start of the year.But even taking into account temporary factors, disinflation has largely stalled over the past few quarters, said Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge.\"Should this month's hotter and broader reading portend a resurgence in inflation in the coming months, the Fed could end up needing to raise interest rates in the second half of 2025,\" he said.(Reporting by Davide Barbuscia, Saqib Ahmed; Editing by Lewis Krauskopf and Richard Chang)"

        "content": "New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose more than forecast in January as core prices reversed last month's easing with the Federal Reserve's path forward in focus.The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 3.0% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices.The index rose 0.5% over the previous month, the largest monthly headline increase since August 2023 and a slight acceleration from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Economists had expected a 0.3% increase.Seasonal factors like higher fuel costs and continued stickiness in food inflation kept the headline figures elevated. Notably, the index for eggs increased 15.2%, the largest increase since June 2015. It accounted for about two thirds of the total monthly food at home increase, according to the BLS.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January climbed 0.4% over the prior month, higher than December's 0.2% monthly gain and the largest monthly rise since April 2023.Core prices rose 3.3% over last year, marking an uptick from the 3.2% seen in December, which was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI showed a deceleration in price growth.Core inflation has remained stubbornly elevated due to sticky costs for shelter and services like insurance and medical care. Shelter did show some signs of easing last month, rising 4.4% on an annual basis, the smallest 12-month increase in three years.It was a different story for used car prices, which saw another strong uptick for the fourth consecutive month. The index rose 2.2% in January after a 1.2% increase in December and a 2% monthly gain in November.Used cars likely contributed to the overall increase in core goods, which hit its highest level since May 2023.Although inflation has been slowing, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis with economists and Fed officials pointing to a \"bumpy\" road ahead.\"There's no sugarcoating this. This is not a good print,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Federal Reserve economist, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program.\"The one thing to say is this is a familiar disappointment,\" she continued, noting the start of a new year has previously contributed to upside surprises. \"Having a hot print in January in recent years has been a common occurrence. It's also been a common occurrence that's dissipated as the year has gone on. So this isn't a deal breaker for the year as a whole, but it is certainly not a good way to start things off.\"Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, agreed, adding \"seasonality and one-off factors may have played some role in the upside surprise.\"However, \"the combination of average earnings growth surprising to the upside last week, the supercore services inflation number moving sharply higher today, and the governments policy agenda threatening to raise inflation expectations, is almost too convincing to dismiss,\" she said.The ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency has further muddied the inflation outlook, with economists arguing the US could face another inflation resurgence as Trump commits to a protectionist trade policy. That's likely to complicate the central bank's path forward for interest rates.On Monday, President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.Shortly after the release, traders scaled back expectations of a Fed rate cut, pricing in just one cut from the central bank this year. Stocks also sold off on the news.\"The Fed is never going to overreact to one month of data,\" Sahm said. \"They've been telling us since December that they are in no hurry to adjust rates again and that will be reinforced today.\"\"We're back in the case of last year where we're going to have to see months and months  getting out of the first quarter  of better inflation data before the Fed gets comfortable with it. So it really does push the timeline probably into the second half of the year [if] this ends up being the outlier.\"Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Treasury Department cut the size of some benchmark bill auctions, the start of whats likely to be a series of reductions as the government preserves its borrowing authority under the statutory debt ceiling.Most Read from BloombergSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterNice Airport, If You Can Get to It: No Subway, No Highway, No BridgeSin puente y sin metro: el nuevo aeropuerto de Lima es una debacleThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleIn New Orleans, an Aging Dome Tries to Stay SuperTreasury said it plans to sell $90 billion of four-week bills Thursday, $5 billion smaller than the previous offering at that tenor. It announced $85 billion of eight-week bills to be sold Thursday, which is also $5 billion smaller. The regular 17-week bill to be sold Wednesday was lowered to $62 billion, a $2 billion reduction.Those are the first reductions for the four- and eight-week offerings since Dec. 26, and the first ever cut to the 17-week issue.Treasury is starting to trim supply as the tax date approaches and as the debt-ceiling constraint becomes more binding, said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US interest rate strategy at TD Securities. We expect bills to gradually become more scarce as the debt ceiling becomes more binding, richening bills and likely increasing the use of the Federal Reserves reverse repurchase agreement facility.With the Treasury taking various measures to avoid crashing into the statutory debt limit  which Congress may be planning to do via the reconciliation process  there has been widespread expectation that the department would start shrinking the amount of short-term securities it sells at weekly auctions.Even without a debt-ceiling crunch on the horizon, the government tends to reduce its borrowing activity in March and April as it collects income taxes. After that, however, it has historically tended to ramp up issuance as the excess generated by tax receipts dissipates.Yet, depending on how long it takes to resolve the debt ceiling, supply reductions could persist. At its quarterly refunding on Feb. 5, Treasury said that until the debt ceiling is suspended or increased, constraints under the limit will lead to greater-than-normal variability in benchmark bill issuance and significant usage of ad hoc cash management bills.So far, the US Treasury has $133 billion of extraordinary measures left, in addition to its cash pile, to help keep paying the governments bills, the department said, citing data as of Feb. 5. Thats out of a total of $338 billion of authorized measures that were available to keep the government from running out of borrowing room under the statutory debt limit and is down from around $205 billion on Jan. 29, according to a Treasury statement released Friday.The measures are a collection of various accounting gimmicks that enable the administration to keep selling debt even though it has run up against the $36.1 trillion borrowing ceiling imposed by Congress at the beginning of January.Treasury started taking the special accounting maneuvers as of Jan. 21 to avoid breaching the US debt limit, and urged lawmakers again to take steps to increase or suspend the statutory ceiling.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Fast Food Could Be MAHAs Next TargetTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of DeclineThe Game Changer: How Ely Callaway Remade GolfTrump Promised to Run the Economy Hotter.

        "content": "By Howard SchneiderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell begins two days of hearings on Capitol Hill on Tuesday with the economy around full employment, inflation expected to ease, and intense uncertainty about how all that will hold up under Trump administration trade and other policies that are still unfolding.Since Powell last appeared before Congress for one of his two regular rounds of testimony, Donald Trump's election has raised the possibility of successive rounds of tariffs, lower immigration and fewer available workers in the economy, and potentially extensive changes in financial sector oversight.Powell and other Fed officials are always careful to sidestep judgment about the wisdom of executive branch or congressional actions, keeping their focus on how the economy changes as a result.But given where the economy stands and the extent of what Trump seems to intend, the premium at the Fed for now is to go slow and hope nothing breaks.\"What we have now is a good labor market. We have the economy growing at 2 to 2.5%. Inflation has come down,\" Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's January meeting.But \"there's probably some elevated uncertainty\" given changes to trade, immigration, fiscal and regulatory policy, Powell said, with Fed officials poised to delay further interest rate cuts until it is clear how the economy adapts in coming months.\"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" Powell said.Powell will carry that message to the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing that begins at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and then to the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. on Wednesday.Both panels are now under Republican control with new chairs. While Powell has made it a priority in his nearly seven years as Fed chair to develop close ties on Capitol Hill, there will be plenty for Senators and Representatives of both parties to question him about.Inflation has fallen and is expected to continue doing so; but some recent consumer surveys have shown the public potentially becoming skeptical, a particular problem for the Fed if that continues.The possibility of steep tariffs on close trading partners like Mexico and Canada and on core industrial products like steel and aluminum has triggered debate over the ways in which such import taxes would or wouldn't cause generalized inflation.The administration hasn't rolled out a detailed tax, spending and deregulation plan yet, but coming negotiations over those issues could have a large influence on the economy's performance.Meanwhile, the Fed is facing turnover in one of its key positions with the resignation of Michael Barr as vice chair for bank supervision and regulation and the eventual appointment by Trump of a replacement, with potentially major changes coming in oversight of the financial sector.For now, investors have read recent data, and in particular the January employment report showing the jobless rate falling to 4% and a strong pace of wage increases, as arguing for fewer Fed rate cuts this year. Markets still anticipate a quarter point reduction in the central bank's policy rate in June, but have begun pricing out any other moves this year.The Fed at its January meeting held the policy rate steady in the 4.25% to 4.5% range after cutting a full percentage point in the last three meetings of 2024.\"We expect Powell will largely reiterate the message from the January FOMC meeting that with a strong economy, solid labor market, and bumpy progress on inflation, the Fed is not in a hurry,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a preview of the week's hearings. \"Recent tariff announcements have also strengthened the case for patience, as uncertainty around and upside risks to inflation appear more elevated.\"(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in January, likely as frigid temperatures kept consumers from automobile showrooms.Retail sales dropped 0.9% last month after an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in December, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, dipping 0.1%.Much of the country was blanketed by snowstorms and freezing temperatures last month. Wildfires in California could also have hurt sales.Some of the decline was likely payback after four straight months of strong gains, partly reflecting pre-emptive buying by consumers in anticipation of tariffs on imports that would raise prices for goods.A 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods was delayed until March. An additional 10% levy on goods from China went into effect this month.Spending remains underpinned by labor market resilience, which is keeping wage growth elevated and the economic expansion on track. Household wealth is at record highs thanks to high house prices, though the stock market has ceded some gains.Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services declined 0.8% last month after an upwardly revised 0.8% jump in December.These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% following a previously reported 0.7% surge in December.Robust consumer spending helped to offset the drag on GDP from inventories being nearly drawn down in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.3% annualized rate last quarter after expanding at a 3.1% pace in the July-September quarter.The strong performance in consumer spending last quarter put it on a higher growth trajectory in the January-March quarter.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

Even before the January producer price index was released, interest-rate strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said investors should buy two-year Treasury notes after Wednesdays selloff pushed yields toward the high end of the recent range.The markets recovery produced gains for those who bought 10-year Treasury notes in Wednesdays auction, and lowered the expected yield for an auction of 30-year bonds at 1 p.m. New York time. Potentially complicating the auction, the Trump administration said it would announce plans for reciprocal tariffs on trading partners at the same time, however CNBC reported they wont take effect immediately.Its a relief rally, said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Elements of the PPI suggest that the Feds preferred gauge of consumer inflation, to be released near the end of the month, will be more benign than the CPI was, she and others said.The yield on 10-year notes dropped as much as nine basis points to 4.53%. The notes drew a yield of 4.632% in Wednesdays auction, which produced the highest new-issue coupon since 2007. The 30-year bonds to be sold at 1 p.m. traded at a yield of about 4.74%, down from a peak of 4.85% Wednesday.The surprise acceleration in consumer price growth battered US government bonds as traders pushed bets for the next Federal Reserve interest-rate cut to December from September. The data intensified fears that inflation has been reignited, and could accelerate further if the tariffs US President Trump has threatened take effect.But while the CPI and core CPI rates unexpectedly quickened, the PCE price index rate that Fed policymakers seek to have average 2% over time may show deceleration to 2.5% for January when released Feb. 28, Citigroup Inc. economists said. They predict the Fed will cut rates in May, though most other Wall Street banks are less sanguine about easing this year, and several predict the central bank will hold rates steady through year-end.The market has done a good job of pricing the inflation risk, Brian Weinstein, head of global markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said on Bloomberg Television.

He will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.Powell is expected to face a raft of questions that could range from monetary policy and the effect of Donald Trumps tariffs to the future of bank capital requirements and the actions of big lenders to \"debank\" certain customers.The central bank held rates steady in the range of 4.25%-4.5% at its last policy meeting on Jan. 29 after cutting rates for three consecutive meetings at the end of 2024. Powell and other Fed policymakers have stressed that they plan to move slowly this year as they assess the path of inflation and the effect of Trumps economic policies.The president thus far has given Powell and the Fed some breathing room. After initially chiding the central bank on inflation, Trump said of the Jan. 29 decision that \"I think holding the rates at this point was the right thing to do.\"Read more: Fed rate decision: How it affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investmentsTrump's Treasury secretary Scott Bessent offered even more assurances last week when he said that Trump is not asking the Fed to lower its short-term rates and is instead focused on bringing down longer-term borrowing costs by targeting the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond.Not everyone is Trump's orbit is staying quiet about the Fed. Billionaire Elon Musk suggested in a series of social media posts this past weekend that the Fed should undergo closer scrutiny.\"All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people. No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve,\" posted Musk, who is roiling other parts of Washington as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).Musk has previously said that the Fed is \"absurdly overstaffed.\"Powell was asked about those comments at a January press conference and said, \"You know, we run a very careful budget process. Were fully aware that, you know, we owe the  we owe that to the public, and we believe we do that.\"Powell made it clear in his new testimony Tuesday that the Fed can hold its benchmark rates steady for longer if the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward 2 percent  the Fed's stated target.If, however, the job market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly, the Fed chair said the central bank could cut rates \"accordingly.\"\"We will do everything we can to achieve the two goals Congress set for monetary policy maximum employment and stable prices,\" Powell said.Powell stressed that a wide set of indicators suggests that the job market is broadly in balance and is not a source of significant inflationary pressures.The January jobs report released last Friday did show continued signs of resilience as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher.This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon.And if anything, that placed more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs again this year. Fed policymakers have predicted a total of two cuts in 2025.A fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday via the Consumer Price Index (CPI).On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior.Powell on Tuesday noted inflation has eased significantly over the past two years but remains somewhat elevated relative to the Feds 2% goal.Powell also reiterated that the Fed is conducting a review of its monetary policy strategy and that the 2% inflation goal will be retained and not be the focus of the review.Jennifer Schonberger is a veteran financial journalist covering markets, the economy, and investing.

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. Social Security plays a critical role in the retirement plans of millions of Americans, but how these benefits are taxed is sometimes overlooked. If you collect $2,700 per month in Social Security benefits, your check is well above the average retirement benefit of approximately $1,800 per month and it could mean that youll owe taxes on this money. However, there are ways to potentially reduce your tax liability. Consider working with a financial advisor to create a comprehensive financial plan for retirement that accounts for your Social Security benefits and tax situation.Social Security benefit taxes are calculated based on combined income. As your combined income climbs, youll potentially owe taxes on a larger percentage of your benefits. Heres how combined income gets calculated:Adjusted gross income+ Nontaxable interest+ Half of your Social Security benefitsSo, for example, say that you withdraw $50,000 from your 401(k) and collect $40,000 in annual Social Security benefits. Your combined income would be $70,000 ($50,000 + $40,000/2).From there, the IRS uses the following income tiers to tax the benefits of people who file their taxes as individuals:Combined income below 25,000: Benefits are not taxableCombined income between $25,000 and $34,000: Up to 50% of benefits are taxableCombined income above $34,000: Up to 85% of benefits are taxableIf you file a joint return with your spouse, the following income tiers will determine the taxability of your Social Security:Combined income below $32,000: Benefits are not taxablesCombined income between $32,000 and $44,000: Up to 50% of benefits are taxableCombined income above $44,000: Up to 85% of benefits are taxableNote that these are not the tax rates. Rather, this means that up to 50% or up to 85% of your Social Security benefits are subject to your ordinary income tax rates. But if you need help assessing your tax liability, consider speaking with a financial advisor with tax expertise.As we mentioned above, the more combined income you have, the more of your benefits can potentially be taxed. If you collect $2,700 per month, thats $32,400 per year in Social Security benefits, which gives you a starting combined income of $16,200 ($32,400/2). If Social Security were your sole source of income, you wouldnt owe any taxes on your benefits.From there, taxes will apply depending on your other sources of income. For example, say that you withdraw $50,000 from your 401(k). That would make your combined income $66,200 (50,000+16,200), meaning up to 85% of your benefits  $27,540  would be taxable.So here are a few strategies to potentially reduce your taxes.The first possibility is to manage your retirement account withdrawals. This depends entirely on your retirement budget and lifestyle, but the less you withdraw the more you can stay under the IRSs tax caps.In this case, you start with a combined income of $16,200. If you withdraw less than $8,800 ($15,800 if youre married and file jointly) from your retirement accounts, your combined income will not trigger taxes on your benefits. If you withdraw less than $17,800 ($27,800 if youre married) in additional income, you will only pay taxes on up to half of your benefits. The trouble, of course, is that this might require living on an unrealistically tight budget. Keep in mind that a financial advisor can help you build a budget and income plan for retirement.Perhaps a more realistic way to manage your retirement withdrawals is to rely on Roth accounts. The money you take from a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) does not add to your taxable income for the year, so these withdrawals wont impact your combined income. This leads to two potential strategies.First, you can maximize Roth withdrawals. By taking all of your retirement income from a Roth account, your combined income will stay at $16,200.However, this approach may drain your Roth portfolios too quickly. Instead, you could structure your Roth withdrawals around the Social Security tiers. By doing this, you would limit your withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts so that your combined income stays below the 50% or 85% threshold. Youd then use Roth accounts for any withdrawals that would otherwise trigger these higher thresholds.For example, say that you want to withdraw $50,000 per year in additional retirement income. You could withdraw $17,799 from a traditional IRA and $32,201 from a Roth IRA. This would give you a combined income of $33,999, ensuring that only 50% of your benefits are taxable.And if you need help with Roth conversions or managing your Roth accounts, consider working with a financial advisor.You could also defer your Social Security benefits, living entirely off portfolio withdrawals during your 60s. Then, you could begin collecting Social Security at age 70 when your benefit maxes out.You wouldnt pay taxes on the benefits that you have deferred. At age 70, you would collect increased benefits and would reduce the amount of money youd need to withdraw from your portfolio. This would have the effect of reducing your annual combined income by thousands of dollars. However, it would require having enough money in your retirement accounts and additional planning to ensure you wont run out of money later in life.Social Security benefits taxes are based on your households taxable income. How much of your benefit is subject to taxes is largely based on three tiers  0%, 50% or 85%. However, you can potentially reduce your taxes on Social Security through structured portfolio withdrawals, Roth conversions or simply withdrawing less.Planning for Social Security is critical. If you need help estimating how much your benefits will be so you can decide when to claim them, SmartAssets Social Security calculator is a good tool to use.A financial advisor can help you plan for Social Security and make other financial decisions that may impact your tax liability in retirement. Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard. SmartAssets free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If youre ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

These loans offer veterans, service members, and their survivors access to low-cost VA mortgages. These loans dont require a down payment or mortgage insurance and have limited closing costs. However, VA loans have something called a VA funding fee, so prospective borrowers need to understand how it works and how the VA calculates the amount.This embedded content is not available in your region.Learn more: What is a VA loan, and who qualifies?In this article:How does the VA funding fee work?What types of loans have VA funding fees?How much is the VA funding fee?How do I pay the VA funding fee?VA funding fee vs. mortgage insuranceWho is required to pay the VA funding fee?FAQsVA loans are insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs, so the VA guarantees a portion of them in case of borrower default. This guarantee means the lender can offer more favorable terms since the VA helps cover some of the risk of default.While VA backing does make it easier for eligible borrowers to afford a VA loan, the program could increase taxpayer costs. This is why the VA requires borrowers to pay a one-time VA funding fee to defray the cost of guaranteeing these loans.The current VA funding fee for purchase loans, which went into effect in April 2023, ranges from 1.25% to 3.3% of your total loan amount. The exact amount of your VA funding fee will depend on a number of factors, including the type of loan you are taking, the size of your down payment, and how many times youve used your VA loan benefit. For refinances and loan assumptions, the VA funding fee can be as low as 0.5% of your loan amount.Read more: The best VA loan lendersThere are several different types of home loans that eligible borrowers may access through the VA loan program. These loan types include:Loan for the purchase or construction of a houseLoan for a manufactured homeCash-out refinancing loanInterest rate reduction refinancing loan (IRRRL)Tip: In addition to these loans, the VA also charges a funding fee for less common loans, including Native American Direct Loans, loan assumptions, and vendee loans for borrowers purchasing a property acquired by the VA.

The size of your down payment and whether you have taken a VA loan in the past do not affect the funding fee.Dig deeper: What is a manufactured house, and how do you finance it?You have two options for paying the VA funding fee. You can choose to pay it as a lump sum at closing, or you can choose to have the fee added to the total loan amount.While financing the VA funding fee by adding it to your loan total will lower your out-of-pocket costs at closing, it will increase the amount of interest you pay on your loan over time.The VA funding fee is a cost added to your closing expenses, and it does act as a type of mortgage insurance. Its different than the more well-known private mortgage insurance (PMI) in several ways, though.Type of loans. The VA funding fee only applies to VA loans. PMI applies to conventional loans. FHA loans, which are backed by the Federal Housing Administration, also charge mortgage insurance called MIP (mortgage insurance premiums). Its easy to confuse PMI and MIP, but they are for two different mortgage types.When you pay the fee. The VA funding fee is a one-time fee paid at closing. PMI is a recurring monthly charge on your mortgage bill based on your loan balance until you have 20% equity in your home.Who pays the fee. Most VA loan borrowers pay the VA funding fee. PMI only applies if youre taking out a conventional loan and make a down payment of less than 20%.Total cost. The VA funding fee is a percentage of your total loan amount. PMI is a percentage of your current outstanding mortgage balance, since you typically pay it monthly.Read more: What is mortgage insurance?In general, any borrower who is eligible for a VA loan will be required to pay the VA funding fee. However, there are several exemptions for military service members or veterans who have been injured while serving or for their surviving spouse. Specifically, the following types of VA borrowers are exempt from the VA funding fee requirement:Those receiving (or eligible for) VA compensation because of a service-related disabilityThose surviving spouses receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)Those active duty service members who have received a Purple HeartLearn more: Who qualifies for a VA funding fee exemption?In some instances, select borrowers may qualify for a VA funding fee refund. If you receive compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs for a service-related disability, you could qualify for a refund. However, the disability compensation start date must be set so it's retroactive to a date before you closed on the VA loan for you to be eligible for the refund.Read more: When do you need a VA Certificate of Eligibility (COE)?In 2025, the VA funding fee for your first VA loan costs 1.25% to 2.15% of your loan amount (depending on the size of your down payment). If you've used a VA loan before, the funding fee ranges from 1.25% to 3.30%. The funding fee will be lower (0.5%) if youre using a VA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL) or if you're buying a manufactured home (1%). Those doing a cash-out refinance will pay a funding fee between 2.15% and 3.3%.No, VA loans do not have PMI or private mortgage insurance. No matter your down payment amount, VA borrowers are only subject to a one-time VA funding fee based on your total loan amount at closing.A VA funding fee is one way to offset the cost of lenders providing VA home loans. You only have to pay it at closing, though, unless you choose to roll it into your mortgage principal. Many other types of loans charge similar mortgage insurance for most of your loan term.This article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

        "content": "Money market yield measures the annualized return on short-term, low-risk investments like Treasury bills and commercial paper. It helps investors compare the earnings potential of different money market instruments while accounting for the impact of compounding. The calculation involves adjusting the discount rate of a security to reflect a 360-day year, making it useful for evaluating short-term fixed-income investments.If you need help investing in money market instruments or other short-term assets, consider working with a financial advisor.Money market yield (MMY) is a standardized way to express the return on short-term discount securities. Using this standard measurement makes it easier to compare different instruments with varying maturities and interest structures.Many money market securities, such as Treasury bills, are sold at a discount rather than paying periodic interest. The difference between the face value and the purchase price represents the interest earned by an investor in these securities. For instance, a T-bill with a face value of $1,000 may be sold for $950. When the T-bill matures, the investor can redeem it to collect the full face value. This $50 gain, equivalent to 5%, represents the interest the investor has earned.The size of the discount, the time to maturity and other features of money market securities may differ widely, making it difficult to directly compare the wide variety of money market securities. To ease comparison, MMY converts this price appreciation into an annualized percentage. This allows investors to gauge the relative attractiveness of short-term investments with greater accuracy.Nominal yields, another measure of return used for short-term investments, may not account for the structure of discount securities. MMY provides a more precise reflection of return by considering the difference between purchase price and face value over time.The formula for calculating MMY standardizes yield calculations based on a 360-day year. This length of year, while not astronomically correct, is a convention commonly used in the money markets and ensures consistency when evaluating securities with short durations.Understanding MMY is particularly useful when comparing different cash-equivalent options, such as Treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Investors and institutions use it to assess the efficiency of short-term capital allocation, determining which instruments offer the best combination of liquidity, safety and return. SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. Money market yield is calculated using a formula that annualizes the return on short-term discount securities based on a 360-day year.The formula for MMY is:MMY = (Discount/Purchase Price) x (360/Days to Maturity)The discount is the difference between the face value of the security and the purchase price. Dividing this amount by the purchase price converts the discount into a percentage return. Multiplying by 360 and dividing by the number of days to maturity annualizes the yield, ensuring comparability across different securities with varying maturities.For example, say an investor buys a Treasury bill for $29,400 with a face value of $30,000 and 90 days to maturity. The discount is $600. Plugging the values into the formula results in:(600/29,400) x (360/90) = 8.16%Based on this calculation, the MMY on this security is 8.16%. This result helps investors compare returns on short-term instruments and decide where to allocate capital for liquidity and yield.Investing in money markets involves selecting short-term, low-risk instruments that provide liquidity and yield. The most common options include Treasury bills (T-bills), commercial paper, certificates of deposit (CDs), and repurchase agreements (repos).Treasury bills (T-bills): These are short-term U.S. government securities sold at a discount and redeemed at face value upon maturity. They are considered one of the safest investments due to government backing.Commercial paper: Issued by corporations to raise short-term capital, commercial paper typically has maturities of up to 270 days and offers slightly higher yields than T-bills, though with more credit risk.Certificates of deposit (CDs): These time deposits, issued by banks, offer fixed interest rates over a specified term. Investors can choose between short-term and long-term CDs based on liquidity needs.Money market funds: These mutual funds invest in a mix of money market instruments, providing diversification and easy access to cash.Investors can access these instruments through brokerage accounts, banks or direct purchases from issuers, depending on their liquidity and return preferences.Money market yield provides a standardized way to evaluate the returns on short-term discount securities, helping investors compare different instruments with varying maturities and pricing structures. By using a formula that annualizes the discount-based return, it offers a clearer picture of potential earnings in the money market space.Understanding this yield calculation can be useful when assessing options like Treasury bills, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Whether investing directly or through money market funds, recognizing how yields are measured allows for more informed decisions when managing short-term capital and optimizing liquidity.High fees and tax inefficiencies can erode returns over time. Using low-cost index funds, tax-efficient strategies like tax-loss harvesting and placing income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts can improve long-term performance.Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

        "source": "POWER Magazine",
        "content": "Succession planning is a priority in the utility industry as an aging workforce, changing technologies, and turnover reshape the sector. The utility sector faces unique challenges, striving for seamless transfers of institutional knowledge while recruiting young talent and preparing the next generation of leaders to navigate complexities and emerging trends.Succession planning is defined as the strategic, ongoing assessment and development of pipelines for critical positions within an organization, conducted in a collaborative nature between the human resources (HR) department and management.Succession planning should be a priority for executives across the energy value chain as it ensures organizations are prepared for the departure of key executives (whether its from retirement, promotion, or a new opportunity), ensuring skills and knowledge are transferred, and leadership voids are filled with qualified employees.All roles in an organization are important, but when it comes to developing a strong succession plan, it is a priority to focus on the roles that are vital to operations and continuity. The best way to do this is to first focus on strategy by identifying internal and external factors that can shape future workforce needs. Consider the following:How will the state of the industry affect operations for the next five to 10 years?What operations are important to the future of the industry?Which operations will grow, stay consistent, be downsized or discontinued?Will any job functions be consolidated?Once these questions are answered, conduct an organizational scan by gathering and analyzing data by department or division to pinpoint critical roles. This scan should identify which roles will be open due to retirement. Often, companies use their payroll or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to quickly identify potential retirement dates based on employee demographic data and any employment rules that govern when employees are eligible for retirement. Another priority during this scan is identifying which positions have high turnover rates. Internal conversations can help identify which positions are experiencing more resignations or terminations. After conducting the organizational scan, the team should analyze any additional factors that may impact succession planning. Think of roles that may have impacts on regulatory compliance and safety, or may require specialized skills. What would occur if this role were vacant? Could operations continue without major impact? The last step combines everything that has been learned throughout the process by creating a list of critical positions. When creating this list, start off slow by only including about 10% of the companys total positions. From here, the organization can slowly build up its succession plan.A competency is a pattern of behavior associated with effective performance that helps an organization achieve desired results. Applying competencies to drive organizational effectiveness and enhance employee performance is known as competency modeling. Competency modeling acts as a framework to define what good performance looks like across different roles. Competency modeling is critical as it ensures that employees are evaluated and developed against the right standards for their roles.Competencies are separate from but equally important to education, certifications, or specialized technical knowledge required to perform a job task. For example, financial acumen may be a competency for any senior leader in the organization. This would be demonstrated by a repeated ability to interpret and use financial data to make business decisions.Depending on the organization, you will identify your role levels. For example, the levels we often use in the utility industry are individual contributor, first line supervisor, middle manager, and strategic leader. From here, competencies should be incorporated into hiring, performance evaluations, and development plans.The basis of workforce succession planning is developing a pool of talent within the organization to draw from when leadership change takes place. To begin identifying internal talent, conduct a scan to create a pool of potential succession candidates. In the internal candidate assessment, start with a larger pool of candidates and narrow it down to only a few after reviewing their skills and competencies. Once you begin narrowing the field, it is time for the 9-box assessment. This visual chart combines past performance reviews, certifications, and special skills for each employee. The 9-box assessment looks at two key factors: performance and potential. At each end of the assessment, employees are scored on a scale of low, medium, and high performance, as well as low, medium, and high potential. It is possible that a utility company works through the 9-box assessment and finds that the existing workforce does not possess the required competencies or certifications to fill the needed roles, which is common in the utility industry as many positions require multiple certifications. In this case, external recruitment becomes part of the workforce succession plan.By the end of the talent identification process, core competency gaps will be identified, which can guide where training and development dollars should be used. Training and development programs are also a key part of a succession plan so current employees are provided with the resources and opportunities to grow into future roles.Succession planning is not about cherry-picking the next in line to fill a position. Rather, it is an opportunity to strategically assess the current skills, knowledge, and competencies in your organization, and determine how you can better prepare the workforceboth internal and external to your organizationto fill critical vacancies when they arise.At this point in the process, you should have a clear picture of the gaps between your current workforce and your future needs. This can be used to pinpoint training and learning budgets to the skills that are most critical, and ensure that you are devoting coaching and mentorship time to the soft skills that can only be learned through osmosis.Institutionalizing knowledge so that it can be transferred to the next generation is a core feature of succession planning and makes a world of difference during transition periods. Documenting policies and procedures is an important component of knowledge transfer, but it can also be hard to juggle during busy workdays. Organizational leadership must prioritize the investment of time and resources, but there are several paths to ensure documentation is created including dedicating employee time to the effort using special project teams or positions, using consultants to do the heavy lifting, and leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)powered software tools.The final step is implementing your succession plan. This can vary by organization, but building a succession planning task force, setting timelines and goals, developing action plans, and engaging employees throughout the process will ensure successful implementation. Ideally, succession plans should be revisited and adjusted annually. The time is now to begin succession plan development for your organization to guarantee operational excellence, organizational continuity, and a culture where employees can grow their careers.Caitlin Humrickhouse is a principal with Baker Tillys Public Sector Advisory Practice."

        "content": "Questrom School of BusinessStudents who engage with their career center see a return on investment. According to research from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), students who use career services receive more job and internship offers and are more satisfied with their career preparation. Lightcast data show that alumni who access career support are more likely to feel their degree was worth the money. But getting students to engage with career services isnt always easy. We ask students to do hard things, said Misty Start, Executive Director for Career Services and Strategy at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. We focus on the importance of networking even when that may make them uncomfortable, or we ask them to rework a resume multiple times.Perhaps because of this tension, students are more likely to go to their faculty or peers for career advice. Rather than engage in a tug of war for student attention, career services staff at Questrom form alliances, collaborating with faculty and student organizations on a holistic approach to supporting students career aspirations. We recognize that we all have the same goal, said Start. We all want our students to develop a clear picture of their own career journey, and to be as prepared as possible to succeed on that journey. Faculty provide expertise on how academics align with career interests, and student club leaders understand student perspectives and needs.Collaboration between faculty, student organizations, and career services has many benefits. Student club leaders provide valuable feedback that informs career services offerings and initiatives, and faculty bring subject matter expertise that supports the development of specific skills and competencies important to employers. And perhaps most important, partnerships with student organizations improve student engagement. An example of the success of this model is the collaboration between the BU Finance Club (BUFC), the BU Financial Modeling Club (BUFMC), the Feld Center, and Questrom faculty members. While the student finance clubs have long offered helpful skills-building workshops to their members, including sessions on financial modeling and Super Day preparation, faculty were concerned that this format lacked the rigor and professional insight needed to meet the demands of a hyper-competitive industry where recruitment begins as early as sophomore year.Recognizing an opportunity for improvement, BU faculty member and BUFC advisor Louis Salemy, a Deans Teaching Fellow and lecturer in the finance department, proposed a different approach. Working closely with club leadership and leveraging support from the Feld Center, Salemy developed a rigorous financial modeling and valuation extracurricular series. Unlike the peer-led structure, this initiative involved weekly evening sessions taught directly by Salemy, blending academic expertise with real-world applications to ensure students were fully prepared for recruiting season. The Feld Center was able to support the administration of the program and provided career advising to students to ensure that they could articulate their new skills on resumes and during job interviews. Another example of a successful collaboration is the Wall Street Trek, a collaborative effort between the BUFC, faculty, alumni, and the Feld Center, that provides sophomores with invaluable real-world exposure. Targeting students aiming for highly competitive internships, the trek offers an immersive experience in New York City, where participants engage directly with BU alumni working in finance.The trek features firm visits, presentations, panel discussions, and networking events designed to introduce students to the realities of working in investment banking, private equity, and asset management. By visiting top firms and interacting with alumni, students gain firsthand insights into the skills and mindset required to succeed in these fields.What makes the trek particularly impactful is its alignment with the early recruiting timelines of top finance firms. For sophomores, this is a chance to ask informed questions, showcase their passion for the industry, and establish meaningful connections with professionals who often serve as mentors throughout their career journeys. Questroms Industry Relations Managers Joe Saunders and Jeff Grossman play a critical role in connecting students with top finance firms and leveraging alumni networks for student visits. Faculty ensure that students are prepared to engage meaningfully, and student club leaders liaise with alumni, organizes logistics, and provide peer mentorship to guide participants. Together, these efforts ensure that students are not only academically prepared but also professionally polished and confident.We have alumni working in finance who are eager to bring Questrom talent to their firms, said Martha Day Sanford, Executive Director of Industry Engagement at Questrom. Collaborations with faculty and student clubs enable us to get everyone on the same page in terms of accelerated recruiting timelines and interview readiness.For students concentrating in finance, these collaborative initiatives are invaluable. The careers they pursue demand a unique blend of technical expertise, analytical rigor, and interpersonal skillsqualities that are best cultivated through a combination of classroom learning, real-world exposure, and professional development. Collaborations with faculty and career services provide students with a distinct competitive advantage.Questrom Dean Susan Fournier has made career readiness a key priority throughout her tenure, allocating resources and encouraging faculty and staff to think creatively about how to best support students to be Day One Ready in their careers. Partnership models involving faculty, career services, and students foster a culture of collaboration and innovation and empower students to have agency in their own career development, which has enabled Questrom to build a pipeline of talented, prepared, and driven graduates ready to excel on day one of their careers.As Associate Dean of the Feld Center, Monica Parker-James leads the industry engagement, career services, career operations, and alumni engagement teams at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Parker-James is an accomplished leader with 30 years of experience in formal and informal education, including 10 years in higher education and 20 years in museum education.  Her areas of expertise include organizational leadership, change management, strategic planning, quality improvement, program and event development, and project management.

Notably, the index for eggs increased 15.2%, the largest increase since June 2015. It accounted for about two thirds of the total monthly food at home increase, according to the BLS.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January climbed 0.4% over the prior month, higher than December's 0.2% monthly gain, and 3.3% over last year. This marked an uptick from the 3.2% seen in December, which was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI showed a deceleration in price growth.Although inflation has been slowing, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis with economists and Fed officials pointing to a \"bumpy\" road ahead.The ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency has further muddied the outlook, with some economists arguing the US could face another inflation resurgence as Trump commits to a protectionist trade policy. That's likely to complicate the central bank's path forward for interest rates.On Monday, President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

A high-yield savings account could make sense if youre looking for a secure place to hold shorter-term savings while earning a solid return. Here are a few key considerations:Interest rates: One of the most important features of a savings account is the interest rate. Its important to shop around and compare the best offers to ensure your money will grow over time. Considering that savings rates will likely drop in the near future, opening a high-yield savings account now will allow you to take advantage of historically high rates.Goals: Todays high-yield savings accounts offer rates we havent seen in more than a decade. That said, savings rates still dont match average returns for the stock market. If youre saving for a long-term goal like retirement, a savings account probably isnt the best place to put your money, since your balance wont grow at a pace that will allow you to reach your target. However, if youre saving for a financial emergency, a down payment on a home or car, gifts for the holiday season, or another short-term goal, a savings account is a great place to hold those funds.Accessibility: Certain types of accounts and investments may provide higher returns than a savings account, but may make it difficult to access your funds in a pinch. For example, if you put your savings in a certificate of deposit (CD) and need to access the money before the maturity date, you could be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. So, if you want to be able to dip into your savings as needed, a high-yield savings account is likely the better choice.Security: In most cases, savings accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the federal limit. They also cant lose money due to fluctuations in the market, making them a low-risk option.Read more: Can you negotiate a higher savings account rate with your bank?This embedded content is not available in your region."

The average 15-year mortgage rate rose slightly to 6.09%, from 6.05%.The 6.87% level is the lowest seen so far in 2025, but mortgage rates have been stuck in an extremely narrow band after hitting a year-to-date high of 7.04% in mid-January.Housing market experts expect that mortgage rates may stay stuck around these levels as financial markets whipsaw in reaction to fast-changing presidential administration priorities and fresh economic data.On Wednesday, Consumer Price Index data showed inflation heated up in January and is running well above the Federal Reserves 2% goal, dampening hopes of lower interest rates. Ten-year Treasury yields, which mortgage rates closely track, initially jumped, and traders pushed back assumptions about the Federal Reserves interest rate-cutting timeline. At year-end, they were calling for two cuts in 2025, but they now see a single cut this year, and not until December.But a day later, yields dropped just as sharply after President Trump pledged reciprocal tariffs on US imports but said they wouldn't go into effect immediately.Read more: Mortgage and refinance rates today, Feb. 13, 2025Though mortgage rates arent controlled by the Fed, they typically move based on expectations about the direction of benchmark interest rates.Mortgage rates are unlikely to drop much any time soon, as debt market investors demand higher returns to account for weakening spending power, and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to lower interest rates, Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner said in a statement. The days of sub-4% mortgage rates are over, and if inflation continues to resist being stamped out, they may not be back for a long time.The near-7% rates kept mortgage applications for home purchases depressed again last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Purchase applications dropped 2% through Friday compared to a week earlier, though refinancings rose.Read more: 2025 housing market: Is it a good time to buy a house?Ask a Realtor is a monthly column.

        "content": "By Howard SchneiderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose faster than expected in January in a sign progress on inflation may remain stalled, data showed on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell heads to the U.S. Congress for a second day of testimony.Rising prices for housing, food and energy pushed the Consumer Price Index up at a 3% annual rate in January versus 2.9% the month before.The change in the Consumer Price Index was slightly above analysts' expectations, and is likely to bolster reluctance at the Fed to cut interest rates any further as policymakers wait for signs that price pressures in the economy will continue to ease.The jump in consumer staples, with gas prices up 1.8% over the month and food at home up half a percentage point, could also feed into public expectations about inflation that the Fed feels are important to control.Powell appears today before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) and typically would repeat the same opening statement delivered in a Tuesday hearing before the Senate Banking Committee.Inflation has been the central bank's top concern since it began to surge in 2021 to the highest levels since the 1980s and prompted the Fed to approve a rapid set of rate increases.Inflation has since eased back towards the central bank's 2% target. But after beginning to cut rates last year the Fed has since moved to the sidelines with policymakers saying they are prepared to stay on hold until inflation resumes its decline and they get more clarity on the direction of the economy under the new Trump administration.\"We do not need to be in a hurry,\" Powell told the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing on Tuesday.That session strayed far beyond monetary policy as lawmakers questioned Powell about his views on tariffs given the import taxes being rolled out by President Donald Trump, the integrity of the U.S. Treasury's payments system, and the state of a separate agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that may be eliminated by the new administration.(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

        "content": "The increasing share of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) in European auto lease asset-backed securities (ABS) portfolios is amplifying residual value (RV) risk, as used BEV prices have lagged behind the broader market, according to Fitch Ratings.The agencys analysis of lease-backed transactions accounts for the uncertainty surrounding BEV resale values and how originators determine RV assumptions.The composition of auto ABS pools largely mirrors Europes new car market with a lag, primarily due to the inclusion of used vehicles. The rising share of BEV collateral reflects BEV registrations, which accounted for approximately 21% of new car sales in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, BEVs represented close to 11% of all Fitch-rated loan and lease ABS, up from around 6% in 2023.Lease-backed ABS generally have a greater BEV share than loan-backed transactions, as they include new-car lease agreements. Corporate incentives, such as tax benefits and subsidies, encourage BEV adoption, while some customers opt for leasing to mitigate exposure to declining resale values. In the Netherlands, one lease portfolio includes nearly 50% BEVs, reflecting the countrys higher BEV penetration.RV risk in auto ABS arises when obligors return vehicles instead of making a large final payment at contract maturity. Lease ABS portfolios typically bear direct RV risk, whereas non-UK loan contracts lack return options, with dealers or borrowers assuming the risk. Since 2023, used BEV prices have fallen more sharply than those of other powertrains, reducing proceeds from vehicle returns. For non-UK auto loan portfolios, lower BEV exposure means any impact is more likely to be indirect, affecting recovery proceeds from defaulted collateral.The decline in BEV resale prices is driven by factors such as an influx of cheaper Chinese-manufactured vehicles, price reductions by established automakers, and consumer concerns about obsolescence. Regulatory uncertainty further weighs on BEV demand. Lessors may raise lease rates to counteract increased vehicle depreciation, potentially further weakening demand.Leasing firms have responded by diversifying vehicle fleets by brand and model, extending lease terms, re-leasing used BEVs, and adjusting RV forecasts downward. The impact on resale prices will become clearer as affected vehicles are returned to the market.Fitchs assessment of RV risk in ABS transactions includes a quantitative evaluation of expected sales proceeds relative to contractual RV amounts, alongside a review of originators RV-setting policies. The agencys base-case recovery assumptions may be set below historical data to reflect anticipated further declines in used-car prices. For portfolios with substantial BEV exposure, Fitch may assume sales proceeds below 100% if originators RV assumptions prioritise lower lease rates over realistic resale expectations.The heightened RV risk associated with BEV resale price uncertainty and limited historical data is also reflected in higher haircuts within stressed assumptions for lease portfolios with significant BEV shares.The future impact of BEV resale prices on RV risk will depend on new car market trends, which vary by jurisdiction and over time. BEVs share of new car registrations in the EU declined to approximately 14% in 2024 but is expected to rise in the medium term as manufacturers and regulators maintain their focus on the segment. Fitch anticipates BEV prices will continue to moderately underperform internal combustion engine vehicles.\"BEV exposure in European auto lease ABS raises residual value risk: Fitch\" was originally created and published by Motor Finance Online, a GlobalData owned brand.

        "content": "By Alden Bentley(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.A rally in U.S. stocks and bonds looked counterintuitive after PPI headlines appeared to be the second hot inflation read this week, but, under the hood, key components looked more like they were moving the direction the Fed and Wall Street want.But even while investors in New York markets lifted the S&P 500 a percent and the Nasdaq more than that on Thursday, continued gains on Asia bourses Friday are hardly assured, given the challenge of navigating the twists and turns from President Donald Trump as he pushes for a peace deal in Ukraine while setting up for a global trade war.The prospect of Russia-Ukraine peace talks helped foster the risk-on mood in stocks, while the inflation news with potential dovish implications for Fed officials reversed Wednesday's bond slump and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell almost 10 basis points to around 4.53%.The bigger-than-forecast 0.4% rise in January's Producer Price Index followed Wednesday's news that consumer prices accelerated by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in January. But some details suggested a more moderate increase in January in the PCE price index that is closely tracked by the U.S. central bank for its 2% target.For instance, physician's office and hospital prices were either broadly unchanged or rose just slightly. Healthcare, with a nearly 20% weighting in the core PCE, declined 0.06%. Portfolio management prices, another important item on core PCE, posted a modest 0.4% increase.Following the PPI data, U.S. rate futures priced in 31 bps of easing this year, compared with 27 bps late on Wednesday, according to LSEG calculations. The next rate reduction is expected either at the October or December meeting.Russia said on Thursday that Ukraine would \"of course\" be involved in talks to end the war, but there would be a separate U.S.-Russian strand to the negotiations. Ukraine and its European allies meanwhile demanded that they be included in any peace negotiations.The markets took in stride Trump's oft-promised roadmap for charging reciprocal tariffs on every country that puts duties on U.S. imports, his latest trade salvo directed at American friends and foes.The dollar pared losses a tad on the tariff headlines and against the yen it was trading at 152.97 yen late in the day, down about 0.9%. The stronger yen in recent weeks has been a negative for the Nikkei but weakness in Asia Thursday was cited as a reason for the index's 1.28% gain.Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet Trump on Thursday, hoping concessions on tariffs, fresh business deals and the prospect of cooperation on China will win the U.S. president's favor.Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday:- South Korea unemployment (Jan)- Malaysia GDP (Q4)- US Retail Sales (Jan)(Editing by Diane Craft)"

The roles are mainly located in Beijing though some will be based out of the startups home city of Hangzhou in eastern China.The postings offer a glimpse into DeepSeeks ambition to remain at the forefront of Chinese AI and compete with global rivals. AGI, which tech executives including OpenAI chief Sam Altman and SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son have portrayed as a sort of industry Holy Grail, refers to AI that understands, learns and applies knowledge across a range of tasks. Unlike more specialized models such as ChatGPT, AGI refers to general cognitive abilities similar to those of humans, sparking fears that AI could surpass human intelligence and run amok.DeepSeek joins a coterie of players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Alphabet Inc.s Google that have articulated plans to explore the field. Reclusive founder Liang Wenfeng has been quoted in interviews touting the field.In ads posted over the weekend, DeepSeek sought a head of legal to help build a risk governance framework for AGI and lead communication with government agencies, regulators and research institutions. For the deep-learning research job, the Chinese company prefers applicants thatve achieved good results in industry competitions. Even for prospective interns, candidates that have published papers for AI conferences or contributed to open-source projects will be prioritized, according to the postings.The job ads joined existing positions advertised on popular recruitment site Boss Zhipin. Among the best-paid roles was that of AGI researcher, which could pull down 1.26 million yuan ($172,000) annually, according to the most recent ads.The Chinese company previously posted ads for a chief financial officer, chief operations officer, head of administration and recruiting manager, suggesting the startup is embarking on a major expansion.DeepSeek shook the AI world this year by releasing multiple models within weeks that showed impressive results when benchmarked against leading models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic.Its services have been overwhelmed with demand since late January, after it unveiled an artificial intelligence chatbot that it says can rival OpenAIs ChatGPT and was developed at a fraction of the cost.--With assistance from Luz Ding and Jessica Sui.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of DeclineTrump Promised to Run the Economy Hotter.

        "content": "U.S. President Donald J. Trumps reliance on the tariff tool kit is creating a level of uncertainty on multiple fronts, especially since inflation was already on the rise before he took office.In fact, the only certainty is that more tariffs are on the way, and with that are rising concerns that inflation could go correspondingly higher too.More from Sourcing JournalHouse Democrat Brands Administration's De Minimis Action as 'Classic Trump Chaos'Shoe Price Increases Accelerated in JanuarySourcing at Magic: Mexican, Canadian Suppliers Brace for Trump TariffsPresently, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent in January, seasonally adjusted. That put the annual inflation rate in the U.S. at 3 percent. The top three categories hitting consumers were food prices rising 0.4 percent, with eggs skyrocketing 15.2 percent, energy prices increasing 1.1 percent, and gasoline prices climbing 1.8 percent. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, apparel prices were down 1.4 percent last month.Economists at Wells FargoSarah House and Michael Pugliesesaid in a research note that the deflationary tailwinds of improving supply chains have petered out, adding that the latest report offers more evidence of progress in lowering inflation stalling out. They concluded that with inflation running above the Federal Reserves stated 2 percent target, the labor market holding steady, and heightened uncertainty around economic policy changes, the Fed will likely stay on an extended hold on interest rates before considering possible cuts in the fall.UBS chief investment officer Paul Donovan in a podcast Wednesday that price increases generally wont show up for several months. That means there wont be any visible inflation in the first quarter unless the tax hikes are very aggressive.Meanwhile, Trump this week imposed 25 percent duties on all steel and aluminum imports, a move thats expected to increase manufacturing costs in the U.S. Hes also threatened reciprocal tariffson a dollar-for-dollar basison imports from another country that has placed duties on U.S. goods. His thinking is to level the playing field because theyre imposing tariffs for American imports that are higher than the duties America has levied on their exports to the U.S. And, while seemingly far-fetched, hes even floated the idea that tariffs could be one way to force Denmark to hand over control of Greenland to the U.S.Economists at Goldman Sachs noted that while reciprocal tariffs would increase U.S. prices, they also see the potential for two benefits. The reciprocal option could be viewed as an alternative to an across-the-board tariff, and would lower the odds of a substantial tariff spike, such as a 10 percent to 20 percent universal tariff. The second possible benefit is that it could lead to lower tariffs on U.S. exports over time as countries rethink their tariff policies.For Trump, the new trade penalties are a way for him to apply pressure to garner concessions on some key issues. At the same time the taxes also collect revenue to offset the budget deficit. Trump predicted last month at a keynote address to the World Economic Forums annual meeting that his new duties would bring in hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury. Hes primarily focused now on Illegal migration and the smuggling of fentanyl across U.S. borders.Trumps also playing a high-stakes game that could backfire. His tariff plan could start a trade war, or at the very least cause mistrust of the U.S. among our trading partners. Its too soon to tell how Trumps plan to tax all will pan out. Hes already backpedaled on the closure of the de minimus loophole by pausing duties on goods valued at $800 or less, or at least until the Commerce Department can figure out a tracking mechanism.The one thing thats most likely on the way from the increase in duties is a rise in inflation.S&P Globals chief economist for U.S. and Canada, Satyam Panday, said that if the U.S. follows through on the tariffs announced for Canada and Mexico, the new duties could cause a one-time 0.5 percent to 0.7 percent rise in U.S. consumer prices, provided the taxes stay in place through 2025. It also could result in a decline in U.S. real GDP (gross domestic product) over the next 12 months by 0.6 percent.In addition, the inflation rate itself could approach 3 percent by the fourth quarter of 2025, Panday said. He added that even a 0.6 percent decline in real GDP would lower households purchasing power, elevate investment uncertainty and result in a hit on American exporters.S&P Global Ratings believes there is a high degree of unpredictability around policy implementation by the U.S. administration and possible responsesspecifically with regard to tariffsand the potential effect on economies, supply chains, and credit conditions around the world, Panday said.In addition to consumer goods pricing challenges, supply chain disruption is expected due to Trumps tariff policies.His confrontational stance is expected to present a straining of relations with allies, particularly through his linkage of trade disputes to other unrelated issues of concern to the U.S., according to a report published by BMI, a Fitch Solutions Co.Research analysts at BMI, which is separate from the credit arm Fitch Ratings, also said that the foreign-born workforce in the U.S. is about 32 million people, representing 19 percent of the total workforce. Undocumented migrants represent about 4 percent to 5 percent of the total workforce, significant enough that mass deportations could impact industries such as construction, agriculture and hospitality. They also found that certain sectors such as construction could see some wage pressures as demand for workers rise in areas such as California, where homes damaged by fires are rebuilt. However, wages in the wholesale, retail and logistics sectors have softened to about 2 percent, indicating less risk for wage pressures, BMI said.According to BMI, consumers and retailers will face significant challenges due to the tariffs, with impacts varying across regions.While American consumers will experience price hikes across multiple categories, it will be the retailers, especially smaller brands, that may struggle with increased costs and supply chain disruptions. The BMI analysts said the impact is less severe globally for markets such as Mainland China and the European Union. The two have both a lower exposure to U.S. imports and a more diversified supply chain.While consumer behavior may trend towards more price-sensitive purchasing decisions, particularly in the U.S., retailers worldwide will need to balance absorbing the higher costs, passing them on to consumers, and finding other suppliers to remain competitive.The analysts also expect shifts in global supply chains as businesses seek to diversify sources, potential localization of production in the U.S. where feasible, and a possible reduction in product variety, particularly from smaller brands."

        "content": "Some mortgage rates have increased today, and others have decreased  but overall, the changes aren't drastic. According to Zillow, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is down by three basis points to 6.54%, and the 15-year fixed rate inched down by one basis point to 5.87%.Interest rates have been holding steady for the last week, but they could shift tomorrow after the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation. Mortgage rates could decrease if inflation has slowed and beats economists' expectations.

Use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator to play around with different outcomes.Our calculator also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when calculating your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.As a rule of thumb, 15-year mortgage rates are lower than 30-year mortgage rates. When comparing 15- versus 30-year mortgage rates, know that the shorter term will save you money on interest in the long run. However, your monthly payments will be higher because youre paying off the same loan amount in half the time.For example, with a $400,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.54% rate, you'll make a monthly payment of about $2,539 toward your mortgage principal and interest. As interest accumulates over decades, youll end up paying $513,969 in interest.If you get a $400,000 15-year mortgage with a 5.87% rate, youll pay about $3,347 monthly toward your principal and interest. However, youll only pay $202,532 in interest over the years.If that 15-year mortgage monthly payment is too high, remember you can always make extra mortgage payments on your 30-year loan to pay off your mortgage faster and ultimately pay less interest.With a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in from day one. However, you will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage.An adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a set period of time. Then the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remainder of your term.Adjustable rates sometimes start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, you risk your interest rate going up. ARM rates have also been starting higher than fixed rates recently, so they're not as good of a deal as usual.Dig deeper: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage  Which should you choose?In 2024, mortgage rates trended downward from early August to the Sept. 18 Federal Reserve meeting, when the central bank announced a 50-basis-point slash to the federal funds rate. Since that announcement, mortgage rates have mostly increased or held steady.The Fed decreased its rate again at its November and December meetings (by 25bps each time). The trajectory of future mortgage rates will largely depend on the Federal Reserves decision on whether or not to cut the federal funds rate at its 2025 meetings.The Fed decided not to cut the fed funds rate at its Jan. 29 meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there's currently a 93.5% chance that the rate remains unchanged at the March meeting too. This means rates probably won't significantly drop in the next couple of months.Dig deeper: Understanding the Fed's rate decisions  Do we want high or low interest rates?According to Zillow data, today's 30-year fixed rate for both purchases and refinances is 6.54%. These are the national averages, so keep in mind the average in your state or city could be different. Your rate will also vary depending on your personal finances.Mortgage rates will probably gradually drop throughout 2025, but they're unlikely to plummet anytime soon.Mortgage rates should go down in 2025, though probably not as drastically as previously expected. Any decreases may be relatively small depending on what happens with the economy, inflation, and the Fed."

These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.There are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because youre spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isnt going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.The main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest  both in the short and long term.A 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and its higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. Youll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.The pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, youll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So youll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.However, because youre paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.Dig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgagesAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.The main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what youll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though  fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)With an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.But if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.Learn more: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgageThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.59% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be even higher.Mortgage rates will probably decrease by the end of 2025. However, any declines will likely be gradual  and they could get higher before they get lower.Mortgage rates aren't dropping  they've actually been fairly stagnant over the last couple of weeks, inching up and down sporadically.In many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher."

        "content": "For small business owners, tax filing can feel like an extra burden. But tax season also offers an opportunity to understand and take advantage of tax savings that can help your companys bottom line.The IRS provides special tax write-offs for taxpayers who are business owners, including for home office expenses, car expenses, and even some personal costs such as health insurance premiums. Here are 18 small business tax deductions, some well-known and others less so.These tax deductions can help reduce a business owner's or entrepreneurs tax bill. Remember, its always a good idea to consult a tax professional about how these deductions apply to your particular business activities.It all starts at home. If youre using part of your home as an office space, you may be able to deduct those expenses.This is true whether your residence is a home, condo, apartment, mobile home, or even a boat. It also includes structures on the property like an unattached garage, studio, and barn.To qualify for this deduction:The space must be used exclusively and regularly for business purposes. In other words, if the space is also a guest room or a makeshift gym, it wont qualify.The home must be the primary place of business. A business owner can still qualify even if they conduct business outside the house, as long as the home is the primary place for administrative and management activities.Youre limited to a certain number of square feet, and there are two different ways to claim it.Go further: Heres a complete guide to claiming the home office deductionOf course youll have to purchase office supplies  and as long as theyre for business-use only, you can deduct those expenses. They may include items like printers, scanners, staplers, pens, and even office furniture.In order for an expense to qualify, the IRS says it needs to be both ordinary and necessary. Thats defined as one that is common and accepted in your industry. A necessary expense is further defined as one that is helpful and appropriate for your trade or business.You can only deduct these expenses within the year you purchased them.Startup expenses are the costs associated with the research and investigation to start the business as well as the initial costs themselves.Some examples of deductible expenses include market and product research, advertisements related to the business opening, employee training, travel related to securing clients and customers, consultant fees, and more.Rental payments on your business property are deductible.One note on this: To qualify, you must not own the real estate or have any type of conditional sales contract that would allow you to build equity in the property.Any types of software you purchase for business use, including subscriptions and leases, can be deducted on your tax return. Examples could be Microsoft Word, Quickbooks, Photoshop, social media software and so on.The same standard applies for software as office supplies. The software must be ordinary and necessary within your industry.This one has changed in recent years. So if youre not up to date, heres the deal.As of 2023, business entertainment expenses are no longer deductible. In the past, you could get a 50% deduction on business-related entertainment expenses such as concerts, sporting events, golf outings, and more. But that ship has sailed.The good news is, many business-related food expenses are still deductible to differing degrees. Company-wide holiday parties, food included as taxable compensation to employees, and food and drinks provided free to the public are all 100% deductible.Client dinners, meals at conferences or while traveling on business, food for a board meeting, and meals provided to employees working after hours are 50% deductible.As always, keep those receipts.Like meal expenses, travel for the purpose of the business is deductible.To qualify, you need travel away from your central place of work for longer than one ordinary days work, and that travel requires you to sleep or rest to meet the work demands. The IRS says business travel cant be lavish, extravagant, or for personal reasons.Deductible examples include:Travel costs for airplanes, bus, train, or carTaxi or rideshare faresUsing a personal car for businessLodgingMealsLaundry costsTipsTravel to conventions and conferences is also deductible as long as they benefit the business itself. Other similar ordinary and necessary business travel expenses are also deductible.Security systems, including surveillance systems and burglar alarms, are considered ordinary and necessary business expenses and are deductible.The IRS says these expenses shouldnt be excessive or unreasonable, and you should be able to justify the expenses if needed. If your home is your primary place of business, your homes security system is a deductible business expense.If you have a vehicle you use for business only, the IRS allows you to deduct all of its related costs of ownership and operation. If you have a vehicle for both business and personal use, you can deduct only the business-related vehicle expenses.You have two options when determining the deductible amount for your vehicle:Standard mileage rate: For tax year 2024, the standard mileage rate is 67 cents per mile. This rate is available if you meet specific IRS requirements, including owning or leasing the vehicle.Actual expense method: Youll need to determine the actual costs you incurred to operate the car for business uses. The IRS says this includes gas, oil, repairs, tires, insurance, registration fees, licenses, and depreciation (or lease payments) attributable to the portion of the total miles driven that are business miles.You can do the math on both to figure out which option gives you a larger deduction.Any professional services you pay for and use for your business, such as legal fees or tax preparation by a CPA, are considered ordinary and necessary expenses and qualify as deductions.The IRS does note that legal expenses you pay to acquire business assets usually are not deductible.All the wages you pay to full-time and part-time W-2 employees are fully deductible, including commissions and bonuses.You can also deduct payments to independent contractors and freelancers. Just make sure they're classified as such by filling out a Form 1099 for any contractor who you paid more than $600 during the year.Any insurance expenses related to the ordinary operation of your business are also deductible. This includes property, employee life insurance, liability, workers compensation, and even automobile insurance.Self-employed business owners can also deduct the cost of health insurance for both the owner and their family.You can fully deduct the cost of your utilities  heating, electricity, water, phone, sewage, etc  if your primary place of business isnt your home. Otherwise, you can only deduct the portion you use for business.If your main office is your home and you create a second phone line for business use only, that expense is fully deductible, as well as any internet expenses related to operating your business.If youve loaned money to a client, vendor, or employee and never received it back, you can claim the bad debt deduction.The IRS says you need to be able to prove it was a business loan, not personal, and not a gift. They add that a debt is closely related to your trade or business if your primary motive for incurring the debt is business related.Examples include:Loans to clients, suppliers, distributors, and employeesCredit sales to customersBusiness loan guaranteesThe IRS will allow you to take a tax deduction for bringing in new customers and keeping current ones through marketing and advertising. Again, the costs must be ordinary and necessary.Typical deductions include advertising expenses, as well as providing meals, entertainment, or recreation to the public as a way to promote community goodwill. Business cards count too.As a small business owner, you can deduct your contributions to a retirement plan, as long as the plan is tax-qualified. This applies whether you're a sole proprietor, in a partnership, or a member of an LLC.Being self-employed, rather than working for an employer with a 401(k) or pension plan, means youll need to do all the legwork yourself with the IRS to make sure your contributions are tax deductible.If youve taken out loans or opened a credit card to help run your business, you can deduct any paid or accrued interest on those debts. This could include mortgage interest on a physical office or storefront. The IRS says that interest relates to your business if you use the proceeds of the loan for a business expense.To qualify for the deduction, you must be legally liable for the debt, intend that the debt be repaid, and have a true debtor-creditor relationship with the lender.The IRS allows small business owners to deduct some federal, state, and local taxes that are directly attributable to the business.Examples include state income taxes, payroll taxes, real estate taxes, plus sales and fuel taxes. Read IRS Publication 334 (for tax year 2024) for more details on these taxes and if you qualify.How you file your small business taxes depends on how you classify your business. Here are the main options.With a sole proprietorship, the business itself isnt taxed. Instead, the business owner reports the business income on their personal tax return.In addition to filling out a typical 1040 personal tax return, the sole proprietor will file a Schedule C  to report the businesss profits or losses. If the business made more than $400 in revenue as a sole proprietorship, the owner will also need to file a Schedule SE to report and pay Social Security and Medicare tax.Like sole proprietorships, partnerships are also taxed at the personal, not business level  a term the IRS calls pass-through taxation because the taxes pass through the business to the business owner.Partnerships should use an information return, called a Form 1065, to report the annual profits, losses, deductions, and tax credits from operating the partnership. The individual partners should also file a Schedule K-1 to report their own individual profits and losses related to the business, along with their standard personal tax return.Unlike partnerships and sole proprietorships, corporations are required to pay taxes on their earnings, and their shareholders are also taxed when those earnings are paid as dividends.Corporations use Form 1120 to report their income, gains, losses, deductions, credits, as well as to figure out their income tax liability."

        "content": "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. eased for the fourth week in a row, an encouraging sign for prospective home shoppers as the spring homebuying season gets underway.The average rate fell to 6.87% from 6.89% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, it averaged 6.77%.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, rose this week. The average rate increased to 6.09% from 6.05% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.12%, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including how the bond market reacts to the Federal Reserves interest rate policy decisions. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has been mostly hovering around 7% this year. Thats more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.Rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who dont have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase.Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years, extending a national home sales slump that began in 2022 as mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows.The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now at its lowest level since Dec. 26, when it was 6.85%.The latest pullback in rates echoes a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans.The yield was at 4.79% just a few weeks ago, reflecting fears that inflation may remain stubbornly higher amid a solid U.S. economy and the potential impact of tariffs and other policies proposed by the Trump administration.A report on Thursday said inflation at the wholesale level was hotter than economists expected last month, following a similar report on inflation at the U.S. consumer level that came the day before.Still, Treasury yields eased. The 10-year yield was at 4.54% in midday trading Thursday."

        "content": "If you're disciplined with your credit card use, your cards can be valuable tools. By using a credit card, you can forgo the hassle of carrying cash and even earn valuable rewards to redeem for gift cards, statement credits, airline miles, or travel.However, credit cards have other benefits than just rewards; many cards come with added protections and benefits that can give you even more value. Learning how credit card protections work  and which cards have the best perks  can help you use your card to its full potential.Credit cards are common; most U.S. adults have at least one credit card. However, people don't always understand all their credit cards have to offer and may be missing out on useful benefits. These are some of the most commonly available credit card protections:Purchase protection covers your new purchases for a specific period, such as 120 days from the date you bought them. If the purchase is damaged, stolen, or stops working during that period, your card issuer will reimburse you for the item's purchase price.There's typically a cap per incident and per account; for example, the card issuer may only reimburse you up to $500 per claim and up to $50,000 per account.With extended warranty protection, the manufacturer's warranty on eligible items is lengthened. Usually, credit cards that offer extended warranty protection will increase the warranty by one year. If your item needs to be repaired or replaced, this benefit can help you save money by allowing you to use the warranty longer.Extended warranty protection is usually a secondary benefit, meaning it kicks in only after you've exhausted your other warranties or insurance.If your credit card provides return protection, this benefit allows you to get a refund of an item's purchase price if the retailer doesn't accept the return within a certain period, such as 90 days from the transaction date.For example, those who have the American Express Blue Cash Preferred card can qualify for a refund of the full purchase price  minus shipping and handling costs  up to $300 per item and up to $1,000 per calendar year.Zero liability protection ensures you're not responsible for unauthorized or fraudulent transactions made to your credit card account. If your information is stolen, zero liability protection keeps you from experiencing any financial losses.Dispute resolution is a benefit that helps you resolve issues with retailers or merchants. For example, if you receive an order that's defective or not as described, you can dispute the charge with your credit card company, and the company will investigate the dispute. You'll get a full refund if the company rules in your favor.Besides basic purchase protections, many credit cards include other perks for travel or shopping. These are some other common card benefits:Baggage loss or delay insurance can lessen the inconvenience of not having your luggage on your trip. With this benefit, the credit card issuer will reimburse you up to a certain amount to pay for toiletries, clothing, or other essentials while you wait for your bags.For example, Southwest Rapid Rewards Plus cardholders can receive up to $100 per day for up to three days if their luggage is delayed by six hours or more. And, if your luggage is lost or damaged, you can qualify for up to $3,000 in reimbursement.When you rent a car, you may need to purchase a rental car policy at the counter to protect yourself. However, some cards offer car rental collision damage waiver protection, a benefit that protects you against damages or theft that occurs to the rental car.To take advantage of this perk, you have to decline the offer of rental car insurance from the rental company and use your card to pay for the entire cost. Credit card-provided coverage is usually secondary, meaning you have to use your primary or car insurance first before the credit card will cover the claim.You also need to check any exclusions that may apply; credit card companies often exclude certain types of vehicles, such as luxury cars or commercial vehicles.You may be eligible for cell phone insurance if you pay your phone bill with your credit card. This insurance protects you against damage or theft up to a certain amount per year.For example, those withUsing a credit card an American Express Platinum card can get reimbursed for up to $800 per claim for repairs or replacement costs, up to a maximum of two approved claims per 12-month period. Coverage does involve a deductible; with the Amex Platinum card, the deductible is $50. (Eligibility and benefit level varies by card. Terms, conditions, and limitations apply. Please visit americanexpress.com/benefitsguide for more details. Underwritten by Amex Assurance Company.)If you book your trip with your credit card, some cards will automatically apply travel insurance to your plan. If your trip is interrupted or canceled because of an eligible reason, such as extreme weather or a death in the family, your credit card will reimburse you for your nonrefundable expenses.Now that you know what common benefits and protections are available, you're prepared to maximize your card's usefulness (or shop for a new card with more perks). To take advantage of your credit card protections, follow these steps:Choose a card carefully: Credit cards may not offer all the protections and benefits described above; card perks vary by issuer and card. If there is a certain perk you're looking for in a new credit card, read the card's terms and conditions to find out if it's available.Review the card agreement: Make sure you understand your card's fine print. You can view your cardmember agreement and the details for any benefits through your card's online portal or by looking up your card's disclosures at consumerfinance.gov.Contact the benefits administrator: To get reimbursed under protections like return protection or purchase protection, contact your card's benefits administrator; you can view their contact information in your cardmember agreement. When you call, the administrator will ask you some questions and, based on the information you provide, send you the necessary claim forms.Fill out a claim form: Next, fill out the claim form. You'll have to provide details on the purchase type, what happened, and the date any issues occurred.Submit supporting documentation: You may need to submit supporting documents, such as your original receipt, a copy of a repair estimate, or a police report.Once the claim is submitted, the credit card company will review it and make a decision. The benefits administrator can give you an idea of timing and when to expect a decision and reimbursement.This article was edited by Rebecca McCrackenEditorial Disclosure: The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

        "content": "(Reuters) - California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara has requested $1 billion in additional funds from the commission's member insurers to shore up the state-backed FAIR Plan after wildfires ravaged swathes of land in and around Los Angeles last month.Lara also directed those responsible for implementing the FAIR Plan - an insurance program designed to help property owners who cannot find private market coverage - to hire more staff and utilize all available funds, including reserves and reinsurance funds.Two fires on either side of Los Angeles burned an area nearly the size of Washington, D.C., from January 7 until they were fully contained, killing 29 people and damaging or destroying more than 16,000 structures, officials have said.As of February 9, the FAIR Plan has received around 3,469 claims for damage caused by the Palisades Fire and around 1,325 claims for damage in the Eaton Fire, its website showed. The program has paid out more than $914 million to policyholders.\"The FAIR Plan must pay claims just like any other insurance company,\" Lara said in a statement on Tuesday.The funding request is necessary for the FAIR Plan to continue meeting its obligations to Californians, the Department of Insurance said in the statement.The funds request could exacerbate financial strain on insurers who have been hit hard by rising catastrophe claims following several wildfires and other natural disasters over the past couple of years.Catastrophe risk modeling firm KCC last month estimated insured loss of about $28 billion from the Los Angeles wildfires, making them the costliest in U.S. history.(Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. A discretionary account allows a financial advisor or portfolio manager to make investment decisions for the account holder. This type of account suits investors who prefer not to manage their investments directly or dont have the time and expertise to do so. By giving the advisor authority, the investor lets them manage the investments according to the accounts goals, risk tolerance and financial objectives. Using a discretionary account to work with a financial advisor can lead to personalized, professional management, which could help you simplify or enhance your investment strategy.A discretionary account allows a financial advisor or broker to make, buy and sell decisions without prior approval from the account holder. These accounts operate under a legal agreement that specifies the advisors authority to make decisions that align with the investors goals.For example, a high-net-worth investor might set up a discretionary account with a financial advisor who oversees multiple asset classes like stocks and bonds, identifies opportunities and executes trades. This approach allows for timely decisions, especially in volatile markets.When opening a discretionary account, the investor signs an agreement granting the advisor or portfolio manager the authority to manage the account within specified parameters. These parameters include the account's risk tolerance, investment objectives and any restrictions, such as avoiding specific industries or asset types.The advisor's primary responsibility is to act in the client's best interest, adhering to fiduciary standards. This involves creating an investment plan, selecting appropriate assets and making adjustments as market conditions change.For example, if the account's objective is income generation, the advisor may focus on dividend-paying stocks and bonds. Growth-oriented accounts, by comparison, might prioritize equities with strong potential for capital appreciation.Discretionary accounts can offer many benefits. Here are four to consider:Professional management: Advisors with discretionary accounts bring expertise in navigating complex markets. They actively monitor your portfolio and make informed decisions to align with your investment strategies, which can be especially beneficial in volatile or specialized markets.Time-saving: With a discretionary account, you don't need to be involved in every decision. This hands-off approach saves time and reduces the stress of constantly monitoring markets.Timely execution: Advisors quickly respond to market changes, seizing opportunities or mitigating risks without waiting for your approval. This agility can be crucial in dynamic markets.Customization: The advisor tailors the portfolio to meet your specific goals, preferences, and restrictions. For instance, if you prefer sustainable investments, the advisor can construct a portfolio focused on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria.Discretionary accounts also have some downsides. Here are four to keep in mind:Cost: Discretionary accounts typically come with higher management fees than non-discretionary accounts. These fees can impact overall returns, especially for smaller portfolios.Loss of control: By granting authority to an advisor, you relinquish direct control over investment decisions. This can be challenging for investors who prefer a more active role in their portfolio management.Potential for misalignment: While fiduciary advisors are required to act in your best interest, there's always a risk that the advisor's decisions may not perfectly align with your expectations or preferences.Performance variability: The success of a discretionary account depends on the advisor's skill and judgment. Poor performance or mismatched strategies can lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.To set up a discretionary account, you will need to work with a financial expert who can help you manage your investments. Here are five general steps to help you get started:Choose a financial advisor or broker: Research top financial advisors or brokerage firms with a strong track record, relevant expertise and a fiduciary commitment. Consider reviews, credentials and personal recommendations.Define your objectives: Clearly communicate financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon and any restrictions. This ensures the advisor tailors the strategy to your needs.Review the agreement: Carefully read the discretionary account agreement. Pay attention to details such as fees, the advisor's authority and the investment strategy.Fund the account: Deposit the initial investment amount into the account. Make sure the funding aligns with the agreed-upon strategy and minimum requirements.Maintain communication: While the advisor manages the account, regular updates and performance reviews are essential. Schedule periodic check-ins to maintain your strategy on track.A discretionary account can offer you a hands-off investment approach that is managed by experts, if you want professional oversight for your portfolio. By giving a financial advisor the authority to make decisions, you save time and benefit from customized strategies that adapt quickly to market shifts. Although there are costs and compromises, such accounts can offer convenience and help you reach your financial goals.A financial advisor can help you create and manage a portfolio.

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-rmd-120000186.html",

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. You may not be thinking about required minimum distributions (RMDs) throughout your career, but chances are that theyll be on your mind once you hit your 70s.The IRS requires you to begin taking annual withdrawals from traditional IRAs, 401(k)s and other tax-deferred retirement accounts. When you must take your first RMD depends on your age. While RMDs currently begin at age 73, that wont always be the case. Under the SECURE 2.0 Act, the RMD age is set to increase to 75 in 2033.RMDs are a critical part of retirement planning. A financial advisor can help you prepare for these mandatory withdrawals, which can have a significant impact on your taxes.On the face of it, the mechanics of RMDs are simple: The account holder takes out a certain percentage of the tax-deferred money based on their account balances at the end of the previous year. That amount is divided by the account holders life expectancy factor  a number computed by the IRS  to produce the RMD amount.For example, the IRS life expectancy for a 74-year-old person is 25.5 years. If their IRA balance was $200,000 on Dec. 31 of the previous year, their RMD amount would be $7,843.Thats just simple math. When youre required to take your first RMD, on the other hand, is a little more complicated:Those born before July 1, 1949, had to take their first RMD at age 70 12, which means those folks should already be taking distributions.Those born between July 1, 1949 and 1950 had to start their RMDs at age 72, and also should have already done so.Anyone born between 1951 and 1959 must take their first RMD by April 1 of the year after they turn 73.Anyone born in 1960 or later must take their first RMD by April 1 of the year after they turn 75.As you can see, the IRS allows you to postpone your first RMD until April 1 of the year after you are required to begin distributions. For anyone born in 1952, their RMDs start this year but they can wait until April 1, 2026 to make the actual withdrawal. After that, each annual withdrawal needs to happen before the end of the year, which means anyone who postpones their first RMD in 2025 will need to make a second withdrawal before the end of 2026.Keep in mind that a financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan, accounting for RMDs as part of it.This raises the question of whether its better to postpone your first RMD. In some cases, it can make sense. If your spouse is still working but plans to retire next year, postponing the first RMD means you might be in a lower tax bracket by April 1 of the following year.The downside of postponing the first RMD is that taking two distributions in the same year could push you into a higher tax bracket. Two RMDs will also likely increase your combined income and potentially lead to taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits. A higher income also could increase your Medicare premiums, which are subject to an income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) surcharge.However, if youre going to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) with your RMD, you wont pay any tax on the withdrawal. As a result, you can postpone your first distribution, leaving the money to generate additional gains until you donate it to a charity. And if you end up needing your second RMD for income, you wont have to deal with the tax impact of two RMDs in one year since your QCD would have been made tax-free.Whatever your strategy for taking RMDs, its important to meet the deadlines. If you dont take an RMD, youll be penalized with a 25% tax on the required amount you didnt withdraw.

        "content": "The priority for the new German government is to establish a clear industrial strategy, modernise the nations energy infrastructure, and implement long overdue reforms in taxation, the pension system and the labour market. Together, these measures will boost economic competitiveness, raise the growth outlook and address growing defence and welfare spending pressures.After five years of near stagnation, the incoming government will have to prioritise boosting economic growth through supply-side reforms, not least because US protectionism adds to the geopolitical uncertainty challenging the German export-led growth model.A broad-based increase in US import tariffs would significantly impact Germanys automotive, machinery and equipment manufacturing industries. Such tariffs would lead to weaker export demand, higher input costs, and shrinking profit margins as companies adjust their supply chains. In addition, even if tariffs are deferred or renegotiated, the persistent uncertainty is likely to curb investment over the coming quarters.Scope Ratings has thus lowered its GDP forecast on Germany for 2025 to 0.1% from 0.9% to account for the likely impact of US tariffs and the collapse of Germanys coalition government in November, which delays potential fiscal stimulus.German GDP growth has lagged that of other major European economies (Figure 1). Since 2019, GDP expansion in Spain (+8%), Italy (+5%), France (+4%) and the UK (+3%) has outpaced that of Germany, as have growth rates in Japan (+2%) and the US (+12%). With demographic pressures mounting, Scope estimates the countrys medium-term growth potential at around 0.5-0.7%.Figure 1: German economic growth is falling behind that of other large economies%Germanys weak growth outlook reflects its declining international competitiveness, dropping from 15th place in 2022 to 24th by 2024 in the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking. However, there are several ambitious reforms the next coalition government could undertake after the 23 February elections to tackle structural challenges.Access to cheap energy has been crucial for the industrial base. However, after post-pandemic price surges, EU natural gas prices in 2024 remained approximately five times as high as in the US. This compares with prices being approximately 1.8x US prices in 2019.One way to address high energy costs is through greater investment in power infrastructure to better integrate growing volumes of intermittent solar and wind-powered electricity. However, relying primarily on private sector commitments will keep German electricity prices among the highest in the EU (Figure 2) as firms pass costs to end-users.The significant investment needs for the energy transition are likely to keep electricity prices elevated compared with those in other EU countries. Still, the new government could consider reducing taxes on electricity and shifting part of the cost for upgrading the grid to the public sector. Such measures could be possible within the existing debt brake framework, if structured as a financial transaction.Figure 2: Household and non-household electricity pricesEUR/kWhA more competitive personal and corporate tax regime could help raise private-sector investment and narrow the large investment gap, which Scope has estimated for Germany at more than EUR 400bn compared to the economies of other AAA Scope-rated sovereigns.Germanys corporate tax rate is high at 29.9%, above those of Italy (27.8%), France (25.8%), the US (25.6%) and the UK and Spain (both 25%). Similarly, the tax wedge  the difference between an employees total labour cost to their employer and his/her net take-home pay  is one of the highest among developed economies.In addition, greater investments in education and labour market reforms could enable higher workforce participation by women and migrants. Given Germanys shortage of skilled workers, reforms to encourage the older generation to work after retirement would support labour supply and ease fiscal pressures stemming from the demographic challenge.Reducing bureaucracy and simplifying regulation to support private sector investment have been recognised as a priority by most political parties, although any implementation of reforms will likely be gradual.These structural reforms are still critical to raising the economys medium-term growth. Combined with a potential reform of the debt-brake rule to allow for more growth-enhancing public-sector investment, this would create additional fiscal space to help address rising expenditure needs while ensuring long term economic resilience.Germany currently meets NATOs 2% of GDP military spending target thanks to a EUR 100bn special fund agreed in 2022. Most of this fund has already been allocated to defence expenditure. However, from 2027, an additional EUR 30bn a year will be needed, requiring higher government revenues, spending cuts or new debt issuance.In 2024, defence spending accounted for 11% of the federal budget. Without additional revenue sources, this share would have to rise to around 18% to meet the current NATO target. If NATO members were to increase the target to 3% of GDP, then 27% of the current budget would have to be allocated to defence spending.At the same time, none of the larger political parties has proposed meaningful reforms to address the rising pension burden , proposals that are unpopular in election campaigns but crucial for long-term fiscal stability. Around 27% of the total 2025 budget will be spent on pensions and this share could double by 2050 with the old age dependency ratio rising to more than 50% from 36% today.For a look at all of todays economic events, check out our economic calendar.Eiko Sievert is a Senior Director in Sovereign and Public Sector ratings at Scope Ratings GmbH, and a member of the rating agencys Macroeconomic Council.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireBig Money Flows to VisaCatalyst Remains a Big Money FavoriteArchrock Growth Transforming Company, Lifting SharesMACOM Technology Shares Rise on AI SalesChallenges for the Pound After Inflation and GDP Edge DownDealer Additions Driving CarGurus Growth"

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. At the age of 60, I recently entered retirement after being a business owner. Ive been securing health insurance through the marketplace since its inception. Currently, my income is derived solely from withdrawing money from my taxable portfolio, comprising reported dividends and capital gains totaling less than $60,000 annually. An advantageous outcome of this approach is that the government covers roughly half of my health insurance costs.  In terms of assets, I possess $625,000 in my taxable portfolio, $115,000 in a Roth IRA and $1,500,000 in a traditional IRA. I am a homeowner, and I lack additional dependents. The plan moving forward involves drawing exclusively from the taxable portfolio until I reach the age of 65 to maintain the current strategy. I am uncertain whether this is a prudent approach or if I should consider tapping into other assets without being overly concerned about the health insurance benefit. KevinIn this case, it makes sense to stick with the plan and draw down regular taxable assets. Drawing from a traditional IRA to have the same amount of disposable funds would create more taxable income and a larger tax bill.When you add health insurance subsidies into the mix you get another benefit by not increasing your taxable income, which would happen simply by switching to a different source for your withdrawals. Plus, the longer you leave money in a retirement account, the more chance it has to grow without a tax drag. (And if you have additional tax or retirement questions, consider connecting with a financial advisor.)The Premium Tax Credit (PTC) helps millions of Americans shoulder the burden of paying for their own health insurance. You can choose to pay lower premiums every month (called the advance premium tax credit) or get a credit for the full amount when you file your taxes.Unfortunately, enhancements made to the PTC as part of the American Rescue Plan and extended via the Inflation Reduction Act are set to expire after 2025. But until then, qualifying for the PTC gives you a larger discount on health insurance premiums.Only people who buy coverage through the health insurance marketplace are eligible to receive these credits. PTC amounts previously depended on income and household size, and were only available to families that earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level.However, those limits won't go back into effect until after 2025, assuming Congress doesn't extend the PTC enhancements again. Until then, PTC eligibility for households that earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level hinges on what percentage of their income would be used to purchase the benchmark plan (second-lowest-cost Silver plan). So, if your household will spend more than 8.5% of your income on premiums, you may qualify for the PTC. (And if you want additional help finding tax breaks, consider working with a financial advisor.)How you take retirement account withdrawals affects your overall taxable income, and that can impact other parts of your finances, including:Whether Social Security benefits are taxableMedicare premiumsEligibility for some tax credits and deductions, including the PTCWhether youll pay net investment income tax (NIIT)Capital gains tax rateMarginal tax ratePlus, the more you pay in taxes, the less money you have for yourself. The way you take retirement withdrawals impacts how much tax youll end up paying. There are three tax buckets to draw from: taxable, traditional, and Roth accounts. Heres a quick look at the tax implications of each once youve passed age 59 12:Taxable accounts: You pay income tax every year on interest and dividend income whether or not you withdraw it, and tax on capital gains  which can have lower tax rates  when you sell assets for a profit.Traditional accounts: Withdrawals from tax-deferred or traditional accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s all go toward taxable income and you pay income tax on 100% of your withdrawals.Roth accounts: You pay no taxes on anything you withdraw so theres no effect on taxable income (as long as the account has been open for at least five years)While everyones situation is different, there are some strategies that can help make the most of your money and minimize the annual tax hit. Talk with an experienced financial advisor to help you make a tax-efficient withdrawal plan that fits your unique situation.Generally there are two main schools of thought when it comes to retirement withdrawals: managing taxable income with proportional withdrawals and keeping Roth assets intact as long as possible.For the first strategy, you would draw down your taxable account until you hit your required minimum distribution (RMD) age. (Assuming that youre currently 60 years old, you wont be required to take RMDs until age 75.) Then, the withdrawal order switches. You would take your RMDs, to avoid tax penalties, and then take withdrawals from all three sources  taxable, traditional, and Roth  proportionately. This method focuses more on both leveling out and minimizing taxable income and taxes.For the second approach, you would look to preserve your Roth assets as long as possible. This strategy doesnt worry as much about minimizing taxable income. Rather, it focuses on leaving the Roth account alone until the rest of your assets have been used up. Here, you would drain your accounts in the following order until each is depleted:Taxable plus RMDsTraditionalRothThis method can cause a tax hump in the middle years of retirement, where your taxable income and taxes peak while youre drawing from the traditional retirement account. However, once your traditional IRA has been emptied, youll no longer face RMDs since Roth accounts are not subject to these mandatory withdrawals.The strategy you ultimately choose can affect both your taxable income and how long your funds will last. Plus, there are more variables to consider, which is why working with a knowledgeable financial advisor can help you make the best possible decision for your situation.If youre thinking of getting financial advice from a professional, be sure to read our comprehensive guide on how to find and choose a financial advisor.Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the latest consumer price data show that while the central bank has made substantial progress toward taming inflation, there is still more work to do.Most Read from BloombergWhy American Mobility Ground to a HaltSaudi Arabias Neom Signs $5 Billion Deal for AI Data CenterSpaceX Bid to Turn Texas Starbase Into City Is Set for Vote in MayCutting Arena Subsidies Can Help Cover Tax Cuts, Think Tank SaysThe Forgotten French Architect Who Rebuilt MarseilleI would say were close, but not there on inflation, Powell told the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday in response to a question on the second day of his semi-annual testimony to Congress. Last year, inflation was 2.6%  so great progress  but were not quite there yet, Powell said, referencing a different inflation gauge than the consumer price index, which came out earlier Wednesday.So we want to keep policy restrictive for now, he added, suggesting interest rates will remain elevated for the foreseeable future.Wednesdays fresh data showed consumer prices grew by more than anticipated at the start of the year. The so-called core consumer price index  which excludes food and energy costs  increased 0.4% in January, the largest advance since March.Following the new data, interest-rate swaps showed traders expected just one quarter-point rate cut this year. Before the CPI report, traders were leaning toward two cuts.Powell acknowledged the CPI reading came in above nearly every forecast, but he cautioned against over-reacting.We dont get excited about one or two good readings, and we dont get excited about one or two bad readings, he said.Nonetheless, the new data add to years of price increases, exacerbating the ongoing hardship for millions of Americans struggling to stretch their paychecks to cover a higher cost of living. They also underscore the difficulty the Fed has encountered in finishing off the post-covid price surge.Powells single-minded goal has been to stifle inflation after it surged to a four-decade high in 2022, and without significantly damaging growth and jobs. A so-called soft landing after an inflation burst is rarely achieved and would be a remarkable victory.Trump PoliciesGetting there may also be complicated by President Donald Trumps plans to impose widespread tariffs, cut taxes and restrict immigration.Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports earlier this week, adding to a 10% duty on all Chinese imports and now-delayed levies on goods from Canada and Mexico. Hes also threatened reciprocal tariffs against countries with levies on US imports.Powell said its not the Feds role to comment on the wisdom of policies enacted by Congress or the administration, but said its possible new policies could prompt the central bank to alter interest rates.The underlying economy is very strong, but theres some uncertainty out there about new policies, he said. Were just going to have to wait and see what the effects of those policies are before we before we think about what we can do.After cutting borrowing costs by a percentage point since September, Fed policymakers have said its time to take a breather on further reductions to assess the economy and await downward inflation progress.Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump called for lower interest rates, noting it would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs in a post on Truth Social. Asked about Trumps post, Powell declined to comment.Bank SupervisionPowell also said that bank regulatory policy was less volatile before Congress established the vice chair for supervision role, suggesting the Fed could do its job more effectively without it.Putting it all in a single person, admittedly, just to recommend to the board  can lead to some volatility in these things, Powell said.Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, a Biden-era appointee, said he would step down as the Feds top banking cop on Feb. 28 or earlier if a successor is confirmed. Barr plans to remain a Fed governor.Framework ReviewPowell said he believes officials will make appropriate and discrete adjustments to its longer-run policy strategy and expects to wrap up the latest review in late summer of this year.When asked if the 2020 framework limited the Feds policy response to inflation, Powell said, No.--With assistance from Maria Paula Mijares Torres and Laura Curtis.(An earlier version of this story was corrected to remove reference to wrong day of the week.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Game Changer: How Ely Callaway Remade GolfElon Musks DOGE Is a Force Americans Cant Afford to IgnoreHow Ouras Smart Ring Bridged the Gap From Tech Bros to NormiesWhy Fast Food Could Be MAHAs Next TargetTrumps Tariffs Make Currency Trading Cool Again After Years of Decline2025 Bloomberg L.P."

        "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-having-consumer-financial-protection-183334692.html",
        "published": "2025-02-12T18:33:34Z",
        "source": "Associated Press Finance",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Congress established to monitor credit card companies, mortgage providers, debt collectors and other segments of the consumer finance industry, is the latest U.S. government agency to have its work halted by the Trump administration.Conservatives have long targeted the work of the CFPB. Critics complain the independent agency, funded by the Federal Reserve System, lacks sufficient supervision and regularly exceeds its regulatory authority. Defenders argue the bureau's watchdog mission has strong bipartisan support.Here's some background on the scope of the CFPB's activities and how the agency's tenuous status might affect consumers:What does the CFPB regulate?The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is charged with creating rules and taking enforcement actions to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices by a wide range of financial institutions and businesses. Its actions involve banks, mortgage servicers, credit card companies, student loan processors, payday lenders, money transfer providers, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors.During the Biden administration, the CFPB passed rules capping bank overdraft fees and removing medical debt from credit reports. The bureau sued financial services companies for misleading consumers and employers for misleading workers. It also focused on curbing junk fees and predatory lending practices.How long has the CFPB been around?Congress established the agency as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. The CFPB says it has obtained nearly $20 billion for consumers since then in the form of monetary compensation, canceled debts, reduced loans and other financial relief.What has the Trump administration done to the CFPB?Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, told the CFPB last weekend to stop its investigations and work on proposed rules. He instructed the agency to suspend the enforcement dates of any rules that had been finalized but not yet put into effect, and closed the CFPB's offices for a week.Vought sent an email to employees on Monday morning saying they should not perform any work tasks. They were directed to contact the top lawyer for the Office of Management and Budget to get approval in writing before doing anything.Vought also said in a social media post that the agency would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, which Congress assigned as the CFPB's funding source to avoid the political wrangling of the congressional appropriations process.Two top officials resigned Tuesday in protest. Also Tuesday, Trump named Jonathan McKernan, a former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member, as the agency's new director.What put the agency in the crosshairs?Before Trump took office, banks and industry groups sometimes sued to block some of the agencys rules.For example, when the CFPB issued a rule in 2017 to limit the number of payments the providers of payday loans, vehicle title loans, and high-cost installment loans could take from customer bank accounts, trade associations for payday lenders challenged the bureau's Federal Reserve funding as unconstitutional. In May 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected their argument and upheld the CFPB's funding and oversight model.Trump on Monday defended his administrations efforts to reform the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying the agency was set up to destroy people.What Biden-era rules and regulations are on hold?The overdraft fee rule was finalized and set to take effect in October, but Voughts directive puts it on hold. Banks had previously sued to get the rule thrown out.The rule would require the largest banks to pick one of three options: to reduce overdraft fees to $5, to reduce them to a rate that reflects how much an overdraft costs them, or to disclose, along with the fee, the fees Annual Percent Rate (APR) as they do with other short-term loans. Overdraft fees currently run about $35 on average.The CFPB finalized a rule in January that would remove medical debt from credit reports. The agency had said the change could potentially improve the credit scores of millions of people and make it easier for them to get mortgages and other loans. The rule was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register but is now suspended. It also was the subject of a legal challenge.President Trump campaigned on lowering prices, and a lot of people voted for him because of high prices. and yet were seeing Republicans move to make them pay high overdraft fees and pay more for loans on their credit, said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. The public broadly thinks that overdraft fees are unfair and medical debt shouldnt be on credit reports. If you ask ordinary people, these are not partisan issues.How is industry responding?Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, characterized the CFPBs work under Biden as aggressive. She said the agency took action in recent years without going through the appropriate procedures.We dont believe they had the proper oversight, she said.Miranda Margowsky, a spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association, an industry group that counts many financial technology companies as members, said her organization anticipates and hopes several CFPB rules, including those governing buy now, pay later plans and other fintech products, will be reversed with the stroke of a pen.She characterized the rules as overly broad, overreaching, and harmful.How are consumer advocates responding?Supporters of the CFPB protested outside the bureau's shuttered Washington headquarters this week. NAACP President Derrick Johnson and others have demanded the office's reopening.The CFPB has provided crucial protections against big banks and lenders, Johnson said in a statement. Without this critical oversight, consumers  especially Black and Brown communities  will be vulnerable to fraud, predatory lending, and discriminatory financial practices.Kitty Richards, senior strategic advisor at the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative, said consumers today are more vulnerable to data privacy violations, junk fees, and financial scams. Without the CFPB, corporations are freer to prey on the American people without fearing they might have to give back the money,\" she said.___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "content": "Managing cash flow is about keeping a business alive. In trucking and other industries operating on tight margins, having cash when needed is the difference between staying in and going out of business. Even a profitable business on paper can fail if it doesnt have the cash available to cover fuel, maintenance, payroll and other daily expenses.Cash flow is the lifeblood of operations for owner-operators, fleet owners and small businesses alike. It determines whether the wheels keep rolling, employees get paid and suppliers stay happy. Understanding how cash flows in and out and taking control of those movements is crucial for financial stability and survival.Cash flow is simply the movement of money in and out of a business. Cash inflows or receivables come from revenue, loans or investments, while cash outflows or payables include expenses such as fuel, insurance, truck payments and repairs. Cash flow management ensures that money comes in fast enough to cover what needs to go out without resorting to expensive short-term borrowing or financial trouble.Cash flow can be unpredictable for trucking businesses. A big contract might mean high revenue on paper, but if customers take 30, 60 or even 90 days to pay invoices, an owner-operator or fleet owner may be scrambling to cover fuel and maintenance or, worse, borrowing money to survive because money is not free. Many trucking businesses use factoring services, net 30 fuel cards, or refinancing options to bridge the gap.A business that effectively manages its cash flow has enough liquidity to:Keep daily operations running smoothly.Invest in equipment, maintenance and growth opportunities.Pay expenses on time and avoid late fees or penalties.Create a financial cushion for slow seasons or unexpected costs.Improve creditworthiness and secure better financing options.Without strong cash flow management, a profitable business can face financial ruin.Understanding Cash Flow ManagementTracking cash inflows and outflows is essential. Many businesses fail simply because they dont have a clear picture of their real-time financial situation.Cash Inflows vs. OutflowsTo effectively manage cash flow, a business has to understand both:Cash inflows  This includes revenue from completed jobs, customer payments, loans or investments.Cash outflows  This covers fuel, payroll, repairs, insurance, truck payments and loan repayments.Cash flow problems happen when expenses outpace revenue, leaving a company short on the money it needs to operate. This is where tools like net 30 fuel cards, strategic financing and expense tracking come into play.Strategies for Optimizing Cash FlowA few simple steps can make a huge difference in keeping a trucking business financially stable:Speed Up Cash InflowsSend invoices as soon as work is completed.Use factoring services if customers have long payment terms.Offer quick-pay discounts to encourage faster payments.Delay Cash Outflows Where PossibleUse net 30 fuel cards to extend payment time on fuel purchases.Negotiate payment terms with suppliers and service providers.Stretch out loan payments when necessary to free up short-term cash.Reduce or Manage ExpensesTrack and minimize unnecessary spending.Optimize routes to reduce fuel consumption and deadhead miles.Regularly maintain trucks to prevent costly breakdowns.When done right, these strategies ensure that a business has the money to operate without constantly being in a financial crunch.The Cash Flow StatementA cash flow statement is one of a businesss most valuable financial documents. It provides a clear picture of a companys financial health by detailing where money is coming from and where its going.Cash flow statements are typically broken down into three main categories:Operating ActivitiesThis includes cash generated from day-to-day business operations, such as revenue from deliveries, employee payments, and expenses like fuel and maintenance.A positive cash flow in this category means a business generates enough money to cover its daily costs.Investing ActivitiesThis refers to money spent on business assets, such as new trucks, trailers or equipment. It also includes selling assets, like when a company sells an old truck to free up cash.Financing ActivitiesThis category covers money borrowed or repaid, such as loans, lines of credit or issuing stock. If a business takes out a loan or refinances a truck, it falls under this category.Understanding these three categories helps businesses spot trends, prepare for cash shortages and make smarter financial decisions.How Refinancing Can Improve Cash FlowRefinancing debt can provide relief for businesses struggling with tight cash flow. By restructuring loans, companies can lower their monthly payments, free up cash and create more financial flexibility.Ways Refinancing Can Help Cash FlowLower interest rates  Refinancing can reduce interest costs, leading to lower monthly payments.Longer repayment terms  Spreading out payments over a longer period can reduce monthly expenses, improving short-term cash flow.Debt consolidation  Combining multiple debts into one loan with better terms can simplify finances and reduce total payments.Cash-out refinancing: Some options allow businesses to borrow against existing assets to free up capital for expansion, repairs or emergencies.Refinancing isnt always the right move. Extending a loan term may mean paying more interest over time, and fees are usually associated with refinancing. Every business should weigh the benefits and risks before making a decision.Cash flow isnt just accounting and keeping books. Whether a business can afford to keep its wheels turning is the reality. Even a trucking business with steady work can run into trouble if payments dont come in fast enough to cover fuel, maintenance and payroll.The most successful businesses take a proactive approach to cash flow management by:Tracking inflows and outflows closely to prevent shortfalls.Using financing tools like net 30 fuel cards and factoring services to maintain liquidity.Refinancing loans strategically to lower costs and free up working capital.Keeping expenses under control to maximize profit margins.Cash flow determines whether trucks keep moving or sit idle waiting for a late payment. By staying ahead of cash flow problems, making smart financial moves and leveraging the right tools, businesses can stay in control, stay profitable and keep rolling forward, no matter the challenges.The post Why Cash Flow Is Critical to Running a Successful Business appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased solidly in January, offering more evidence inflation was picking up again and strengthening financial market views that the Federal Reserve would not be cutting interest rates before the second half of the year.The producer price index for final demand rose 0.4% last month after an upwardly revised 0.5% gain in December, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 0.3%. In the 12 months through January, the PPI advanced 3.5% after increasing 3.3% in December.The report followed news on Wednesday that consumer prices accelerated by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in January, dimming hopes that the U.S. central bank would resume cutting rates in June. Financial markets now expect a rate reduction in September, though some economists believe the window for further policy easing has closed, citing strong domestic demand and a stable labor market.Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday \"we are close but not there on inflation,\" adding \"we want to keep policy restrictive for now.\"The Fed left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%-4.50% range in January, having reduced it by 100 basis points since September, when it launched its policy easing cycle. The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.President Donald Trump's fiscal, trade and immigration policies are seen fanning inflation. A 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico was suspended until March. But a 10% additional tariff on Chinese goods went into effect this month.With January's PPI report, the BLS updated weights to reflect price movements in 2024, and seasonal adjustment factors, the model that the government uses to iron out seasonal fluctuations from the data.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

A September rate cut is still seen as more likely.Fed policymakers last month kept their policy rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week he feels policy needs to stay restrictive until there is better progress on bringing down inflation.Central bankers also have their eye on any signs of weakness in the labor market that could trigger an interest rate cut.On Thursday, a separate government report showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, suggesting the labor market remained stable early in February.(Reporting by Ann Saphir with reporting by Lucia Mutikani, Howard Schneider, Dan Burns; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

When you sell a primary residence, the IRS allows you to exclude from your capital gains taxes the first $250,000 of profits if you file single or $500,000 of profits if you file jointly. You must include any surplus of those amounts in your taxable capital gains for the year, though. So, what if you sell your house for an $800,000 profit? You will probably owe taxes on a good portion of that sale, although youll get a significant tax break in the process.Do you have questions about downsizing for retirement or retirement planning in general? Speak with a financial advisor today.When you sell any asset, including anything from real estate to investments to personal property, the profits are considered capital gains. The IRS calculates those profits as the following:Sale Price  Tax Basis = Taxable Capital GainsThe sale price is whatever amount you received for selling the property, and the tax basis is the amount of capital you have invested in the underlying asset. For real estate, this generally includes:The price paid to buy it, including legal fees, title insurance and costs of setting up necessary services like utilitiesCosts of improvements and upgrades to the building or property (generally considered any costs that improve the property or extend its lifespan)Some costs involved with selling the property, including realtors fees, advertising and costs involved with showing the propertyHowever, this generally does not include property taxes, financing or interest costs, costs of use and occupancy and necessary maintenance.So, for example, say that you buy a house for $500,000. You then have the following hypothetical expenses:$40,000 of mortgage interest$25,000 to remodel the kitchen$6,000 to repair a weak point in the roofIf you now sell the house, your cost basis would be $525,000, as the home cost you $500,000 and the kitchen counts as an upgrade to the property ($25,000).Your financing costs do not count, nor do the necessary repairs you made to the roof. Repairs are considered costs to maintain the propertys existing value rather than upgrades to improve the propertys value.If, down the road, you then sell the house for $700,000, you would have $165,000 of potentially taxable capital gains ($700,000  $525,000 = $175,000).If you have questions about retirement planning, consider speaking with a financial advisor.When you sell a primary residence, the IRS allows you to take a home sale exclusion, otherwise known as a Section 121 exclusion. Under this rule, you can exclude a certain amount of primary residence sale profits from your taxable capital gains. For single filers, this number is $250,000, and for joint filers, its $500,000.You must meet certain conditions in order to claim this exclusion. Most notably:You must have owned the home for 24 of the last 60 months (can be nonconsecutive)You must have used the home as your primary residence for 24 of the last 60 months (can be nonconsecutive)You must not have claimed the home ownership exclusion in the past two yearsIndividuals who meet these conditions can first eliminate the exclusion amount from their home sale profits, then include any remainder in their taxable capital gains for the year. Individuals who do not meet these conditions must include all of their profits from the sale of the property in their taxable capital gains for the year.So, for example, say that you have sold your house and netted $800,000 after accounting for the propertys tax basis. Heres how youd break this down:If your home does not qualify for the Section 121 exclusion, you have taxable capital gains of $800,000.If your home does qualify for the Section 121 exclusion, you have taxable capital gains of either $550,000 as a single filer ($800,000  $250,000 = $550,000) or $300,000 as a joint filer ($800,000  $500,000 = $300,000)The advantage of the home sale exclusion is that its simple and offers a considerable amount. Most households will be able to avoid taxes on much or all of the profits from the sale of their home under this law, and the rules are very straightforward. Consider consulting a financial advisor to plan a tax strategy for your home sale and beyond.When you sell your home, you can take a $250,000 (single) or $500,000 (joint) exclusion from your capital gains. After that, you must pay taxes on any remaining profit from the sale. This is a significant and straightforward tax break, but it will mean at least some taxes for especially high-profit sales.A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan that could include downsizing.

Suppose you and your spouse are both 65 years old, have $1 million in savings and collect $30,000 per year in Social Security. Is that enough to fund a $70,000 per year retirement?It will depend on your personal circumstances, especially where you live, but $70,000 may be enough for some households. Whether your assets can generate $70,000 per year is a bit more difficult to answer, though. Here are a few important things to consider. And if you need more help planning for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.Can you afford to retire and live on $70,000 per year? Jeremy L. Suschak, a certified financial planner (CFP) with DBR & Co., says its generally manageable, but ultimately depends on the circumstances of your individual retirement. Where do you plan to live, for example, and what are the costs of living? What assets do you have to fall back on at need, and what debts or liabilities do you have? Do you support dependents, and what kind of lifestyle do you want to lead?Perhaps most of all, what is your health situation?It will help if lifestyle expenses are low and there is zero or minimal debt in place, Suschak told SmartAsset. Having proper insurance coverage will also be critical so that significant, unanticipated out-of-pocket expenses do not derail the spending limits.A $70,000 per year income is not far from the U.S. median, so it can work for many households. Just make sure it can work for yours.Can your portfolio generate $70,000 per year? In answering this question, think about how much income your savings and investments will generate.Suppose you follow the 4% rule, meaning you draw down 4% of your portfolio in your first year of retirement. Here, this would give you $40,000 in your first year of retirement and then a bit more each subsequent year to account for inflation. Combining your withdrawals with a $2,500 per month Social Security benefit, youll be able to meet your $70,000 income goal. Be warned, though: You would run out of money within approximately 20 years.But the good news is that you can do even better.The above scenario assumes you keep your portfolio entirely in cash. If you invest it, even modestly, you can potentially extend the longevity of your portfolio and/or generate more income. For example, say that you put everything into bonds. Right now that would give you a yield of around 5%. Combined with Social Security that would generate about $80,000 per year indefinitely. Or say that you buy a $1 million annuity. That would likely pay over $107,808 (again combined with Social Security), guaranteed for life.Can this portfolio generate $70,000 per year? Yes. But it can do even more if you let it.Set up the right portfolio for your financial goals with a financial advisor.It matters quite a bit whether the money in your portfolio has already been taxed or not.If you hold this money in a 401(k), a traditional IRA or another pre-tax account, you will pay income taxes on your distributions, as well as taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits. Keep this in mind, because your after-tax income will end up being less than $70,000.On the other hand, if you have $1 million in a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) you will not pay taxes on portfolio withdrawals. That money has already been taxed so its had the luxury of growing tax-free. You will still pay taxes on 85% of your Social Security benefits though, so expect about $3,300 per year in federal income tax.Finally, dont forget about inflation.While your Social Security benefits are indexed to inflation, interest and annuity payments are not. While comfortable in 2023, a $70,000 income does not have a lot of cushion. So you may want to invest for some growth, otherwise by the end of your retirement inflation might make this a very tight budget.Talk to a financial advisor today to plan a path to your financial goals.With $1 million in the bank and a $30,000 Social Security benefit, you can generate $70,000 per year in retirement income with high likelihood. And the good news is that you can probably do even better than that with a bit of smart money management.We didnt have time to discuss state-specific taxes here but dont overlook this important part of the retirement planning equation.

        "content": "Youve probably got one or two financial jobs on your to-do list that you were too busy to get to or perceived as boring administrative work. Here are some tasks that a) frequently fall by the wayside and b) dont take a lot of time to rectify.Pain point 1: Contributing to an IRAFor higher-income savers with good-quality 401(k) plans, its easy to see why putting additional funds into an IRA might not seem like a must-do. But making $7,000 annual contributions for 30 years and earning a 6% return would translate into an additional $550,000 in retirement.Tips to get it done: To make hitting IRA contributions more doable and palatable from a budgetary standpoint, put them on autopilot, instructing your investment provider to deduct whatever amount you can swing from your checking account on a monthly basis.Pain point 2: Converting backdoor contributions to RothIf the conversion is done shortly after the contribution, the investments wont likely rack up much gains in the interim, and any taxes on conversion are also apt to be limited. But if too much time elapses and you invested in something that has enjoyed nice gains since you bought it, youll owe ordinary income tax on that appreciation when you finally get around to converting.Tips to get it done: Its wise to wait at least a few days after the contribution to make a conversion. To make sure you dont forget, schedule the conversion date on your calendar at the same time you make the contribution.Pain point 3: Investing health savings account assetsAs a long-term savings vehicle, health savings accounts are hard to beat because they offer a trifecta of tax benefits: tax-free contributions, tax-free compounding, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified healthcare expenses.But inertia is no doubt a stumbling block for some HSA contributors, too, as the process for getting the funds invested can be cumbersome.Tips to get it done: The name of the game is to invest your HSA in line with how youre using it. If youre tapping it for ongoing healthcare expenses and/or you need to maintain a minimum balance in the savings account, its wise to maintain a balance in the savings option even as youre directing additional assets to the investment option.Pain point 4: Keeping beneficiary designations up to dateBeneficiary designations are one of the most important aspects of an estate plan, in that they typically supersede whats stated elsewhere in the plan.Yet as important as they are, beneficiary designations can become outmoded for a few key reasons. First, people change investment providers; while the assets may transfer over successfully, the account owner will likely have to redesignate beneficiaries with the new provider. Second, and most obviously, lives change: People get married and have children, loved ones die, and once-close bonds can fray. All of these life events can affect whom you want to inherit your assets. Finally, estate plans might have implications for beneficiary designations; if youve created a trust, for example, the trust might now be the beneficiary of a given asset versus a human being.Tips to get it done: Because the right beneficiary designation can change over time, check them annually as a component of your annual portfolio review. And if youve gone to the trouble of creating an estate plan with the help of an attorney, get their guidance on how best to designate beneficiaries. (Most attorneys will give you very specific instructions on this when you wrap up your estate plan.) Finally, if you havent reviewed your beneficiaries for a long time, use this article as an impetus to do it now.___This article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

        "content": "Im 63 and have zero retirement, just Social Security benefits. How can I begin saving? And where can I begin investing this late in the game?-RitaSaving for retirement is certainly easier and has a greater impact on you the earlier you begin, which you seem to understand. The longer you wait, the less time you have to put aside money. Additionally, the compounding effects from interest, dividends and growth have less time to work for you.Regardless of how late you start, however, I dont like the idea of broadly classifying it as being too late. I worry that if someone thinks it is simply too late to start saving for retirement, its easy to slide into the thought that it isnt worth planning at all. That part isnt true and believing it will leave you worse off.Yes, you need to be realistic about your retirement expectations such as when you can afford to retire or the type of lifestyle youll be able to maintain. But that doesnt mean there isnt anything you can do to make your retirement better.A financial advisor may help you identify and understand retirement income strategies.Start SavingIf someone starts saving at 63, its a pretty safe bet that they should be saving everything they reasonably can. I cant say how much that is for you because I dont know you or your situation, but give some serious thought to what that amount would be. You still need to eat, pay your bills and have a life. But come up with an amount that you can put aside and commit to it.An added benefit of going through this exercise is that you may find ways to cut expenses from your budget. If you can get used to living on a smaller budget before you retire, it will make your transition easier and more financially viable.Are you likely to amass a large savings balance by the time you retire? No, but it will be more than the $0 you have saved now. Ill give you an example. Lets just assume that youll max out an individual retirement account (IRA) each year. Thats $7,000 per year since you qualify for the 50 and older catch-up contribution. Lets say you work until you are 70 and ignore the potential maximum contribution limit increases.Over the next seven years, youll have saved $49,000. Depending on how you invest and the rate of growth on those investments, your account could grow beyond that. For example, at an annual growth rate of 3%, your final balance could reach $53,637. With a higher annual growth rate of 9%, your balance could reach $64,403.Are any of those amounts enough to send you on a European river cruise every year? No. Would having that much money accessible to you provide you with an additional layer of security? Yes.So no, it isnt too late to start. Consider speaking with a financial advisor to build a plan.Plan for Other IncomeRegardless of what you commit to saving now, it is unlikely that your savings alone will support you. I dont say that to be discouraging. In fact, I say that so you dont get distracted by it or become frustrated with your progress and give up. Instead, view any amount of savings you accumulate going forward as an improvement from your current situation.Next, think about the other sources of income you might have in retirement.Calculate Social SecurityLets start with Social Security because the odds are that you are covered, and if you are, it will be the biggest source of income you have once you retire. You need to make the most of it. That may mean waiting for as long as you can to file, so you can take advantage of the delayed credits.Here is how that works:For each full year past your normal retirement age that you wait before claiming, up to age 70, your monthly check goes up by 8%. It sounds like you were born in 1959. If so, your normal retirement age is 66 and 10 months, and if you wait until 70 to claim youd get an extra 25.3%. On top of that, your Social Security benefit offers some protection from inflation because of the annual cost of living adjustment.While I certainly think theres a lot to be gained by waiting, and you should strongly consider it, dont just assume that you should wait until 70 and certainly dont make that decision based on what Ive said here alone. Current financial needs, health concerns or your family history may provide ample reason to file before then. The point I want to make here is that Social Security is likely a very important component of your retirement, and you should give considerable thought to your filing strategy (or consult a financial advisor if you have more questions).Consider Part-Time WorkIf you are able, planning to have a nontraditional retirement may be something you want to consider as well. Income from part-time work coupled with your Social Security benefit could be all you need to live comfortably. It will certainly make your savings go further.More retirees are opting for this type of arrangement than have in previous generations. Often, its not even for financial reasons but to have social interaction and a sense of purpose.What to Do NextBe realistic about what starting now means for your retirement lifestyle and consider these options for funding retirement.Brandon Renfro, CFP, is a SmartAsset financial planning columnist and answers reader questions on personal finance and tax topics.

Bearer bonds are a type of unregistered fixed-income securities that provide ownership rights to whoever physically holds them. Unlike traditional bonds, bearer bonds do not require the holder to be listed in any records, making them transferable through simple possession. These bonds were popular in the past because they provided anonymity. Nowadays, they are rare due to stricter regulations and security concerns.A financial advisor can help you assess the risks and benefits of different financial investments for your portfolio.Bearer bonds are debt instruments that differ from traditional bonds in how they are owned and redeemed. Registered bonds, a more common type, record ownership with a central authority or issuer. Bearer bonds, in contrast, are unregistered.Ownership of bearer bonds is tied solely to possession. That means whoever holds the physical bond certificate has the right to collect its interest payments and redeem its value at maturity.Each bearer bond typically comes with physical coupons attached, which the holder must physically present to claim interest payments. These coupons are detached and submitted to the issuer or a designated paying agent for redemption. The bond certificate itself must be redeemed to receive repayment of the principal amount once the bond matures.The anonymity of bearer bonds made them attractive in the past, particularly for those seeking privacy in financial transactions. However, this same feature has led to their decline, as governments and regulatory bodies worldwide have raised concerns about their use in tax evasion, money laundering and other illicit activities.Today, bearer bonds are largely a historical financial product. There continues to be some limited issuance in a few jurisdictions, however, with stringent rules governing their use.Bearer bonds emerged in the late 19th century as a convenient and anonymous way for investors to hold debt securities. Their popularity grew during the early 20th century, particularly in Europe and the United States, as they offered flexibility and privacy.Unlike registered bonds, which required detailed ownership records, bearer bonds allowed individuals to transfer wealth discreetly through physical possession. This feature made them appealing for international transactions and estate planning. The anonymity of bearer bonds, once an advantage, has become a liability in today's regulatory environment.During the mid-20th century, bearer bonds became a standard financial instrument for governments and corporations to raise capital. However, their unregulated nature also attracted misuse, including tax evasion and illicit financing.By the 1980s, concerns over these activities led to increased scrutiny and stricter regulations. The U.S. government began phasing out bearer bonds in 1982 through the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA), effectively halting their issuance domestically. Today all U.S. Treasury marketable securities are issued electronically.Governments and financial institutions now prioritize transparency to combat money laundering and tax evasion. Without ownership records, it is difficult to ensure compliance with financial laws. As a result, most modern financial systems rely on registered securities that tie ownership to an individual or entity.While bearer bonds have largely disappeared in many countries due to regulatory changes, they are still issued and traded in select jurisdictions, though opportunities are limited. Some countries, including Switzerland and Luxembourg, have continued to allow certain types of bearer securities under specific conditions.Additionally, bearer bonds may occasionally be available through secondary markets, such as private sales or auctions, where individuals or institutions liquidate their holdings.Investing in bearer bonds today typically involves working with specialized financial advisors or brokers who are familiar with the niche market. These professionals can help identify legitimate opportunities and navigate the legal and logistical complexities of acquiring and managing bearer bonds. Its important to understand the regulatory environment of the country where the bond is issued, as laws governing their use can vary significantly.Purchasers should exercise caution, as the anonymity of bearer bonds can make it challenging to verify their authenticity. Thorough due diligence is necessary to ensure the bond's validity and confirm that it isn't subject to legal restrictions or encumbrances.Redeeming bearer bonds is still possible in many cases. Old U.S. Treasury bonds can be redeemed, for example, by sending them to the Treasury Department. Whether a given bearer bond can be redeemed largely depends on the issuer, the bond's maturity date and the jurisdiction where it was issued.For bonds that have not yet reached maturity, the holder can typically redeem them by presenting the physical bond certificate to the issuing entity or its paying agent. The process involves verifying the bond's authenticity and ensuring all attached coupons have been redeemed or accounted for.For bearer bonds that have matured, the redemption process can be more complex. Many issuers impose deadlines for claiming principal payments, known as a prescription period. If this period has expired, the bondholder may lose their right to redeem the bond. Additionally, some older bearer bonds issued by defunct companies or governments may have no redemption value if the issuer no longer exists or has defaulted.Bearer bonds offer a glimpse into financial history, standing out for their unique ownership structure and anonymity. While their issuance has declined due to regulatory concerns, they remain an investment option in niche markets for seasoned investors who understand the risks. For those who still hold bearer bonds, redeeming them requires attention to the issuer's policies and deadlines.A financial advisor can help you analyze and manage investments for your portfolio.

        "content": "If youre a homeowner who has paid down a chunk of your mortgage or whose house has gained value, you might be able to take out a loan secured by your home equity. However, having equity in your home isn't the only requirement to qualify for a home equity loan.Heres what you need to know about the requirements for a home equity loan. By understanding the rules of thumb, you can decide if a home equity loan is right for you and prepare accordingly.Learn more: What is a home equity loan? A complete overviewThis embedded content is not available in your region.In this article:How a home equity loan worksRequirements for a home equity loanDocuments youll need to qualifyFAQsHome equity describes the difference between the value of your home and your outstanding mortgage balance. For example, if your home is worth $400,000 and you still owe $300,000, you still owe 75%  meaning you have 25% equity.A home equity loan is a type of second mortgage that allows you to borrow from the equity youve built. It's a secured loan, so it uses your house as collateral.Home equity loans typically have fixed interest rates, and the loan proceeds are disbursed as a lump sum. To repay a home equity loan, you'll make regular monthly payments that are amortized over the repayment term, which can be as long as 30 years.The amount of money you can access through a home equity loan depends in part on the market value of your home because equity is calculated by subtracting your mortgage balance from the market value.Dig deeper: How much is your house worth? How to determine your home value.Borrowers must meet several essential lending criteria to qualify for a home equity loan. While the specific requirements vary from one mortgage lender to another, these are the typical standards you must meet to qualify for a home equity loan:Most lenders only offer home equity loans to homeowners with at least 15% to 20% equity. For example, lets say your home is currently worth $400,000, and you owe $350,000 on your mortgage. Most lenders wouldn't allow you to take a home equity loan because you've only accrued $50,000 in equity, which is 12.5%.A homeowner with a house valued at $400,000 would need at least $60,000 to $80,000 in equity to reach the minimum 15% to 20% required by most lenders.Also, most lenders won't allow you to borrow more than 80% of the equity you have built in your home. So, if you have $80,000 worth of equity in your home, your lender will generally cap your home equity loan at $64,000  or 80% of the $80,000 in equity.Read more: 7 ways to build equity in your homeLenders need to trust that you'll repay your home equity loan. Thats why they set minimum credit scores and maximum debt-to-income ratios to qualify for this type of second mortgage.Though credit requirements for home equity loans vary by lender, the typical minimum required credit score is 680. However, an even higher credit score can help you qualify for lower interest rates and better terms.The debt-to-income ratio (DTI) calculates how much of your monthly income goes toward your mandatory debt payments. Lenders typically prefer a DTI ratio of 43% or less, though some will require a slightly lower or higher ratio. Like having a higher credit score, a lower DTI ratio can increase your chances of qualifying for better home equity loan rates and terms.Learn more: What is debt-to-income ratio, and how do you calculate it?You'll need to verify your income to qualify for a home equity loan. The mortgage lender requires proof that you earn enough to afford the payments on your home equity loan. You may need to provide pay stubs, W-2s, or tax returns to prove your income level.Dig deeper: What percentage of your income should go toward a mortgage?Homeowners insurance doesnt just protect you against an unexpected loss  it also protects your lender in case something happens to your home. This is why mortgage lenders require homeowners to carry appropriate insurance as a loan condition.Its the same for home equity loans. To qualify for a home equity loan, you must provide proof of your current homeowners insurance policy. Your insurance policy protects the lenders investment in your home in case of a disaster.Read more: What does homeowners insurance cover?Home equity loans usually require an appraisal to determine the home's current market value. The home appraisal ensures the mortgage lender knows exactly how much equity you have in the house. That way, the lender can protect itself from loaning a borrower too much money.Keep learning: How a home appraisal worksPreparing the necessary documentation and information before you start your home equity loan application can make the process easier. Most borrowers will need these documents to apply for a home equity loan:Your most recent mortgage statement: This document displays the remaining balance on your primary mortgage.Proof of income: This might include your most recent tax return, W-2s, and pay stubs. Youll also need proof of employment.Bank statements: The mortgage lender may want this information to determine your cash reserves before you take on more debt.Insurance documentation: The lender will need a copy of your homeowners insurance policy and any hazard or flood policies.Identification: Have your Social Security number, drivers license, or passport on hand.The lender will also need to see your home appraisal, although the lender usually orders the appraisal after you've applied for the loan and received preapproval.Read more: How to choose between a second mortgage and a refinanceA home equity loan lender could deny your application for various reasons. Lenders might turn down homeowners with insufficient equity, even if they might otherwise qualify. But having enough equity in your home doesn't guarantee a loan. If your credit history is poor, you have a high debt-to-income ratio, or you can't prove that you have enough income to repay your loan, a lender might reject your home equity loan application.Usually, yes  most lenders require an appraisal for a home equity loan because it assesses how much your home is worth, which helps determine how much equity you have. Having an appraisal ensures that neither the lender nor the borrower uses an inflated value to pinpoint the level of equity.Yes, the term second mortgage refers to any new loan you take out using your home as collateral when you already have a first mortgage secured by the home. That means home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are both types of second mortgages.This article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.Todays average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.57%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.If you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.57% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,910, and youd pay $387,613 in interest over the life of your loan  on top of that original $300,000.The average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.88% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because youll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and thats 15 fewer years for interest to compound.However, because youre squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time, your monthly payments will be higher.If you get that same $300,000 mortgage but with a 15-year term and a 5.88% rate, your monthly payment would jump up to $2,512  but youd only pay $152,189 in interest over the years.Dig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.With an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends  that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.ARM rates have also been higher than fixed rates lately. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.Mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.You can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option  for example, maybe you get a 6% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4% for year one, increase to 5% for year two, then settle in at 6% for the remainder of your term.Just consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself whether youll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.Learn more: How to get the lowest mortgage ratesHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.57%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.88%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.87%.A normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.57%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.While mortgage rates could inch down here and there, they probably won't significantly decrease in the beginning of 2025."

Imagine that youre 60 years old with $800,000 in retirement savings and $4,000 in monthly living expenses. However, you want to wait until age 65 to claim Social Security, so you need to find a way to generate additional income for five more years.A 4% withdrawal rate would provide $32,000 annually from the $800,000, leaving a $16,000 gap each year. Social Security benefits will likely fill that gap, but not for another five years. One option for covering the shortfall is to take strategic early withdrawals above 4% for five years, then reduce your withdrawals to replenish your savings after you start taking Social Security. You could also buy a temporary annuity that pays $48,000 for five years. Heres a closer look at these potential options.Whether you plan to delay Social Security or not, a financial advisor can help you build a retirement income plan to meet your needs.The basic challenge of funding retirement is generating sufficient income to cover regular living expenses. With $4,000 in monthly costs, your retirement funding challenge calls for $48,000 annually. The 4% safe withdrawal guideline proposes that retirement savings can safely produce 4% income per year, adjusted upwards annually for inflation, with little risk of depletion over a 30-year retirement. In your case, 4% of $800,000 is $32,000  $16,000 less than you need. Rigidly applying the 4% guideline isnt going to get it done this time.Once you start receiving Social Security benefits, the income and expense gap likely will disappear. The average Social Security retirement benefit at the end of 2024 was $1,925 per month but lets assume youll collect $2,000 per month at age 65 for simplicitys sake. Your exact benefit will of course vary depending on several factors, including your past earnings record. However, if we assume a $2,000 monthly benefit, Social Security will likely more than adequately fill your living expenses shortfall of $16,000 a year.But if you need additional help building a retirement income plan to ensure you can meet your monthly expenses, consider speaking with a financial advisor.Now you have to figure out how to cover the annual shortfall between ages 60 and 65.One option is to simply withdraw $4,000 per month from your retirement savings. Then, once you start taking Social Security, you can withdraw less from your savings in hopes that your investment earnings will replenish what youve taken out.For example, you could withdraw $48,000 annually, or 6% of $800,000, for the first five years. This allows full spending with no lifestyle change. After Social Security payments start in year six, you could reduce your withdrawals to 3% to let the savings recover and grow.Assuming a conservative 5% average annual rate of return for your savings, the $800,000 would drop to about $750,000 after five $48,000 withdrawals and five years of market growth. With Social Security now in the income mix, you withdraw only 3% of your savings starting in year six. Assuming the same 5% return on investment, at this more modest withdrawal rate over the next five years your savings account will return to and even exceed the original $800,000 balance. After that, you can opt to take 4% withdrawals and enjoy additional income with long-term security or let the account continue to grow.Then again, withdrawing a static $48,000 per year likely wont be enough to keep up with your expenses, since inflation pushes the cost of goods and services up each year. As a result, you may need to tweak your withdrawal rates to meet your income needs, which would deplete your savings at a slightly faster rate.This strategic early withdrawal approach is not the only way you could go. For example, you could purchase a temporary 6% annuity paying the needed $48,000 for only the first five years. You could also work part-time to generate additional income or cut your living expenses temporarily. A financial advisor can help you determine whether an annuity is a suitable option for your unique needs.Higher withdrawals early in retirement provide essential income at the cost of draining principal faster and increasing the risk that your account will run out of money while you are alive. Even if higher withdrawal rates are only temporary, your retirement savings may not capture assumed returns. If investment performance lags, accounts may not fully return to their previous levels.Health is another concern. It can be hard to predict your future health status, but you very likely will have to pay for private health insurance premiums before you become eligible for Medicare at 65. Out-of-pocket costs for this could run thousands per year.Annuities, meanwhile, guarantee income but pose additional problems. For one, when you buy an annuity you lose control of how funds in the account are invested. Annuities are also complex and dont keep up with inflation. Products vary widely in features, fees and the financial strength of the backing insurers. You may not be able to find an annuity with the required combination of return, cost and issuer stability.Your life expectancy is another hard-to-predict variable. If you live long enough, the chances of your savings going dry may increase. And as mentioned above, inflation-driven price hikes could make your expense projections off the mark. If your strategies to produce additional income fall short, you may have to reduce spending at some point. However, pairing an $800,000 IRA or 401(k) with Social Security benefits would likely support greater consumption than $4,000 per month. But if you need help planning for various risks in retirement, consider connecting with a financial advisor using this free matching tool.With $800,000 in savings, you can probably cover $4,000 in monthly living costs. However, retirement accounts alone cannot safely sustain that spending for a 25- or 30-year retirement. To align cash flows and balance risk, you could fund five years of retirement by increasing your withdrawal rate from savings, letting accounts rebound afterward. Or you could use some of the $800,000 to purchase a temporary annuity paying $48,000 for five years only.Either way, once Social Security payments start, your total income should be able to cover ongoing costs, assuming your monthly expenses dont dramatically increase. However, consider making contingencies for market volatility, lower Social Security benefits, rising prices and other risks. It takes decades of hard work to be able to afford retirement. Estimating how much youll need to support your lifestyle in retirement is a critical piece of the puzzle. Luckily, SmartAssets retirement calculator can help you project how much youll need to have saved up to afford retirement and whether youre on pace to hit that target.Consider meeting with a financial advisor to review your retirement plan. An advisor can run projections and scenarios to help you optimize your retirement withdrawal strategies and make your money last. SmartAssets free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors in your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If youre ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation.

Home buyers who make a down payment of less than 20% will be required to purchase PMI as a condition of the loan.Requiring PMI allows lenders to offer mortgages to home buyers with limited cash reserves. If you are required to purchase PMI, your mortgage lender will set up the insurance with a private insurer. Heres more on what you need to know about private mortgage insurance, including how much it costs, how long you have to pay it, and how to avoid it.This embedded content is not available in your region.In this article:How much is private mortgage insurance?How long do I have to pay PMI?How do I avoid PMI?Types of PMIFAQsLearn more: What is mortgage insurance, and why do you need it?Most borrowers pay the added cost of PMI along with their monthly mortgage payment, though some lenders may let you pay it all up-front in some scenarios. According to Freddie Mac, monthly premiums for PMI generally range from $30 to $70 for every $100,000 you borrow. Your exact rate and monthly payment will vary depending on the value of your home, the size of your down payment, and your credit score.Heres an example of how much you could expect to pay for PMI premiums depending on the size of your down payment. Assume you are purchasing a $350,000 home with a 30-year mortgage with a fixed rate of 7%.Read more: How to get a 3% down mortgageTheres no flat fee for PMI. Instead, PMI costs are calculated based on the risk you present to the lender (how likely you are to default on the mortgage) and several factors that are unique to your loan. These include:Your down payment amount: A larger down payment means the lender has to loan you less, which makes the loan less risky. As a result, it will usually equate to a lower PMI cost. If you make a 20% down payment on a conventional loan, you dont have to pay PMI at all.Your loan amount: The more you borrow, the higher your PMI costs will typically be, as the lender has more to lose if you default. Also, your PMI is usually calculated as a percentage  so a percentage of a larger amount results in a higher insurance payment.Your credit score: A higher credit score indicates youre responsible with your money and stay current on your debts. This will usually qualify you for lower PMI costs, while a low credit score will do the opposite.The type of mortgage loan youre using: Youll usually pay higher PMI costs on mortgages with adjustable interest rates. This is because the rates and payments on these loans can change often, making it harder for borrowers to stay current on payments.Your lender should give you an idea of your PMI costs on your Loan Estimate and again in your Closing Disclosure, which youll receive no later than three days before closing on your loan.Dig deeper: Closing Disclosures  What they are and why they matterThe good news about PMI is that you are not locked into it for the entire life of the loan. Below are three ways your PMI may be canceled  which will lower your monthly payment.Borrowers have the right to request PMI cancellation once the principal balance remaining on the mortgage has reached 80% of the homes original value.The law requires your lender to cancel your PMI upon reaching the 80% principal balance as long as you meet these requirements:You request the cancellation of PMI in writingYou are current on your mortgage payments and have maintained a history of on-time paymentsYou do not have any second mortgages on the propertyYour homes current value is not less than its original valueLearn more: How much is your house worth? How to determine your home value.Though you must specifically request to cancel your PMI at the 80% principal balance milestone, your lender will automatically cancel your private mortgage insurance once your principal balance reaches 78% of the original home value.This cancellation is automatic, but it may not go through if you are not current on your mortgage payments.Read more: What is mortgage principal, and how do I pay it off?Reaching the halfway point of your mortgage repayment term  whether or not your principal balance has reached 78% of the original home value  will also automatically trigger the cancellation of your PMI. For a 30-year mortgage, this means your PMI will be canceled when you reach year 15, even if you still owe more than 78% of the homes value.Borrowers must be current on their mortgage payments for this automatic cancellation to occur.Dig deeper: What does PITI mean, and how does it affect your mortgage?The simplest way to avoid paying PMI is to put down at least 20% on a conventional loan, which would give you that 80% loan-to-value ratio (LTV ratio) your lender is looking for.However, if you are not able to afford a 20% down payment, here are some other ways to avoid paying PMI:Piggyback mortgage: With a piggyback loan, you use a second loan to cover part of the down payment you cant make out of pocket. For example, you may put down 10% of the homes price, take a conventional mortgage for 80%, and add a second mortgage, called a piggyback mortgage, for the remaining 10%. The piggyback mortgage will usually be a home equity loan or home equity line of credit, and it will have a higher interest rate than the primary mortgage, it will allow you to avoid PMI on your primary loan. Youll need to run the numbers to see if this will work in your financial favor over the long haul.Lender-paid mortgage insurance: Some lenders will cover the cost of your private mortgage insurance in exchange for a higher interest rate. Well go more into this below.Yahoo Finance tip: While you won't pay private mortgage insurance on any government-backed loans, FHA loans charge their own mortgage insurance, the USDA charges an upfront and ongoing fee, and the VA charges an upfront fee. With FHA loans, most borrowers cannot cancel mortgage insurance without refinancing into a different loan type.Dig deeper: Understanding FHA mortgage insuranceThere are several types of PMI you might encounter when you buy a home. These include:This is PMI that youll pay as the borrower. Often, youll pay this monthly as part of your mortgage payment. This is a good option to minimize your closing costs and spread out your PMI costs over time.You can also pay your PMI premium at closing or finance it into your mortgage loan. This is a worthwhile option if you need to minimize your monthly payment or if youre able to negotiate for the seller or builder to pay this premium (if youre located in a buyers market, for instance).Keep learning: Is it a buyers market or a sellers market? How to tell the difference.Sometimes, the mortgage lender pays for PMI in exchange for charging you an origination fee or higher interest rate. Lender-paid insurance can help minimize your monthly payment and closing costs. Keep in mind that it may result in more long-term interest expenses unless youre planning to refinance.Single-premium PMI is paid in a one-time lump sum at closing. This might be the best option if you want the lowest possible monthly mortgage payments and have plenty saved up for closing costs. Again, this could be your best bet in a buyers market where you can negotiate for the seller to pay for this premium at closing.Split-premium PMI arrangements allow you to pay part of your PMI premium up-front (at closing) and part of it via monthly payments spread across your loan term. You may also be able to have one party cover the up-front portion (maybe the lender, for example), while you, the borrower, cover the monthly payments.Split-premium PMI can help you spread out your PMI costs, paying some in a lump sum at the beginning while also minimizing the amount it adds to your monthly mortgage payment.Private mortgage insurance, also called PMI, protects your mortgage lender in case you default on your loan. Youll usually need to pay it if you make a down payment of 20% or less on a conventional mortgage loan.The exact cost will depend on your down payment, interest rate, and credit score. On a $300,000 home with a 30-year term, 7% interest rate, and 10% down payment, youd pay about $176 per month, according to Freddie Mac.PMI costs vary based on your homes value, your down payment, and your credit score. Freddie Mac estimates youll pay anywhere from $30 to $70 per month for every $100,000 you borrow.Does PMI go away after 20%?You can cancel your PMI after you reach 20% equity in your home, but youll have to request it with your lender in writing. Once you reach 22% equity (meaning your loan balance is 78% or less than your homes value), your lender will cancel PMI automatically.This article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley."

        "content": "When you have a traditional job, your employer withholds part of your paycheck for taxes, but when youre an independent contractor, youre responsible for withholding tax money on your own.If you expect your tax liability to exceed $1,000 for the year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expects you to make quarterly estimated tax payments. Youre also responsible for self-employment taxes, which pay for both the employee and employers share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, on top of federal income taxes and any applicable state and local taxes.Paying independent contractor taxes requires solid planning and recordkeeping, but it doesnt have to be overwhelming. Read on to learn how taxes work for independent contractors, how you file, and some important tax deductions to be aware of.Independent contractors can be referred to by a number of terms. You may be an independent contractor if youre a small-business owner operating as a sole proprietorship, you do gig work, or youre a freelancer.Determining whether someone is an independent contractor vs. an employee can get tricky. Companies that misclassify a worker as an independent contractor instead of an employee could be on the hook for paying self-employment taxes on the workers behalf.The IRS uses a three-pronged common law test to determine whether a worker can be classified as an independent contractor. The test consists of the following factors:Behavioral control: Does the company have the right to control when and how work is performed? If a company dictates a work schedule, requires you to report to a specific location, or provides training or extensive instructions, its likely that you should be classified as an employee instead of an independent contractor.Financial control: How much discretion does the business have to determine the economic aspects of the workers job? Independent contractors often invest significant amounts in their own tools and equipment, have unreimbursed business expenses, can incur profits and losses, and can usually seek out other work opportunities. A traditional employee is usually paid a salary or an hourly wage, while independent contractors are more likely to get paid a flat fee per project  though billing on an hourly basis isnt unheard of.Type of relationship: Employees often receive benefits like a 401(k), health insurance, and paid time off that arent typically afforded to independent contractors. Usually, workers are classified as employees if their role is expected to continue indefinitely, whereas independent contractors are more likely to be hired for a specific project or time frame.When you get hired for a job, a business may spell out whether youre an employee or an independent contractor in the contract. However, a contract alone isnt enough to determine whether you should be classified as an independent contractor. If the IRS determines you should be an employee instead of a contractor based on the level of control it has over your work, a business could be required to pay self-employment tax on your behalf.Suppose youre a web designer whos hired by a business to perform services. Lets look at how your role would look based on whether youre an employee or an independent contractor.If youre an employee: The business can tell you when and where you need to perform your design duties. Youd receive a regular paycheck with federal taxes withheld. You may be eligible for benefits like health insurance, a retirement plan, and paid vacation and sick leave. Your employer would provide your laptop and other equipment. They may also pay for training to help you advance your skill set. Your company may or may not allow you to pursue outside work.If youre an independent contractor: You have greater control over when and (often) where you perform your work. When youre paid, youre responsible for tax withholdings. In addition to regular income taxes, youd be on the hook for self-employment taxes. Youre unlikely to receive employee benefits or company equipment. If you want to learn a new skill, youd need to pay for your training. But if you want to pursue other design clients, youd typically be free to do so.Read more: What is withholding tax?Independent contractors are generally required to withhold taxes from their earnings to pay self-employment tax and federal income tax, as well as state income taxes and local taxes, if applicable.As an independent contractor, youre required to file a tax return and pay self-employment taxes if you have net earnings of more than $400 in one tax year.Additionally, if you earned more than $600 from any individual client or business, they must complete Form 1099-NEC, which is used to report nonemployee compensation. Theyll need to furnish you with a copy and send one to the IRS.Independent contractors need to make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect a tax bill of at least $1,000 for the year. You could face an underpayment penalty if the taxes you pay throughout the year dont add up to at least 90% of your tax liability for the current year or 100% of your tax liability for the previous year.These are the quarterly estimated tax deadlines for tax year 2025 that independent contractors must adhere to:April 15 (for income earned Jan. 1 to March 31)June 16 (for income earned April 1 to May 31)Sept. 15 (for income earned June 1 to Aug. 31)Jan. 15, 2026 (for income earned Sept. 1 to Dec. 31)Read more: All about quarterly estimated taxes Here are some common tax forms independent contractors can expect to deal with:Form 1040-ES: Use this form to calculate and make quarterly estimated tax payments.Form 1099-NEC: You should receive Form 1099-NEC from any individual or company that paid you $600 or more during the tax year. Prior to 2020, Form 1099-MISC was used to report independent contractor payments, but this IRS form is no longer used for these purposes.Schedule C (Form 1099): Youll use Schedule C to report business profits or losses on your 1099 form if youre an independent contractor who operates as a sole proprietorship.Schedule SE (Form 1099): Youll use this form to file and report your Social Security and Medicare taxes, also known as self-employment taxes or SE taxes.Form 1099-K. You may receive Form 1099-K if youre an independent contractor or small business owner whose clients pay via Venmo and other third-party platforms. Eventually, the IRS will require these services to send you Form 1099-K if you receive payments of $600 or more. However, the IRS is taking a phased-in approach to implementing this rule. For tax year 2024, theyll need to send the form if you earned $5,000 or more using the platform. In 2025, platforms will be required to send the form if you earn $2,500 or more.One upside of being an independent contractor at tax time: You may be eligible for small-business tax deductions you wouldnt qualify for if you were traditionally employed. Some examples are:Home office deduction: If you have a space in your home that you use solely for business purposes, you may be able to deduct a fraction of expenses like rent, mortgage interest, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.Automobile deduction: If you use your car for business, you can either deduct your actual expenses for using the vehicle for work purposes or take the standard IRS mileage deduction. The standard mileage deduction was 67 cents per mile driven in 2024 and increases to 70 cents per mile in 2025. Because drivers for app-based services are usually classified as independent contractors, this deduction is especially valuable if you use your vehicle to drive for a ride-share service, like Uber or Lyft, or make deliveries.Cellphone, internet, and laptop: You can deduct these expenses if theyre necessary to perform your work as an independent contractor. You can only deduct the percentage of the expense that corresponds to your usage, though. For example, if you use your home internet 40% for business and 60% for personal activities, you could only deduct 40% of the cost.Business travel expenses: Business travel costs, like airfare, baggage fees, and lodging, may be tax-deductible. However, the IRS warns that you cant deduct travel expenses if theyre lavish or extravagant or for personal purposes.Health insurance: If youre an independent contractor, you can often deduct the cost of your health insurance premiums for yourself, your spouse, and your tax dependents. Youre only eligible for this tax write-off if neither you nor your spouse qualifies for employer-sponsored health coverage.Self-employment taxes: Independent contractors are responsible for self-employment tax that usually amounts to 15.3%. However, you can deduct 50% of the self-employment tax you pay.Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction: As an independent contractor, you can deduct up to 20% of your taxable income, though this deduction phases out at higher income levels.The deductions above are all above-the-line, meaning you can take them regardless of whether you take the standard deduction or itemize.Go further: 16 small business tax deductions you need to know aboutAs an independent contractor, youre required to pay a 15.3% self-employment tax on 92.35% of your net earnings if you earned more than $400. Self-employment taxes are similar to FICA taxes you pay toward Social Security and Medicare when you have a traditional job.With a regular job, most people pay 6.2% of their wages for Social Security taxes and another 1.45% for Medicare taxes, or 7.65% total. Then, their employer matches that 7.65% in what are collectively known as payroll taxes. But when youre an independent contractor, you pay both the employers half and the employees half of those taxes, which is why the self-employment tax is usually 15.3%.Theres a limit on how much of your earnings are subject to Social Security tax, though. This is known as the Social Security wage cap. In 2025, you wont owe Social Security taxes on earnings above $176,100, up from $168,600. However, you may face an additional Medicare tax of 0.9% if you earn more than $200,000 as a single filer or $250,000 as a married couple filing jointly.Tax filing gets a bit more complex for self-employed people like independent contractors and sole proprietors. Be sure to keep good records so youre prepared at tax time. These are the general steps youll need to follow:Compile your documents: To calculate your earnings, youll need your 1099 forms and any other income statements. To calculate your business expenses, youll need your receipts and possibly bank account and credit card statements.Calculate your net profit or net loss: Next, youll use the documents you gathered to calculate your net profit or loss. If you earned more than you spent on business expenses, you have a net profit; if your expenses are more than you earned, you have a net loss. Youll use Schedule C for Form 1040 to report your net profit or loss.File your self-employment taxes using Schedule SE. Youll use Schedule SE of Form 1040 to calculate and report your self-employment taxes. Report what you owe in the Other taxes section youll find on Form 1040.Start making quarterly tax payments. Use IRS Form 1040-ES to calculate how much you should pay in estimated quarterly taxes. This amount will be based on your projected adjusted gross income, taxable income, tax obligations, and any tax deductions or tax credits you qualify for.You may be able to file your return on your own using tax preparation software if your situation is relatively straightforward. But if youre a taxpayer with multiple income streams or youre claiming large deductions, it may be worth hiring a tax professional to make sure you follow the IRS rules and take advantage of any available tax breaks.Read more: Need more time to file? Heres how to file a tax extension.No. Companies give a W-2 form to employees at the end of the year. Self-employed individuals who work as independent contractors typically receive Form 1099-NEC.Most independent contractors pay a 15.3% self-employment tax in addition to federal income tax, as well as state and local taxes, depending on where they reside. The overall tax rate for independent contractors will vary based on their tax bracket.Youll often pay more taxes as a 1099 worker because youre responsible for the self-employment tax. Essentially, 1099 workers pay both the employers and employees share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, amounting to a self-employment tax of 15.3%. However, as a 1099 worker, youll often qualify for tax deductions you wouldnt be able to claim as a regular W-2 employee.Aim to set aside at least 25% to 30% for taxes as an independent contractor. Youll need to save enough to pay the 15.3% self-employment tax, as well as regular income taxes. Because everyones situation is unique, consult with a tax adviser for a more precise estimate of how much to set aside."

        "content": "Managing freight costs is one of the most critical aspects of running a trucking business. Ensuring that invoices are accurate with rising fuel prices, fluctuating rates, and complex carrier agreements is essential for financial stability. Unfortunately, billing errors, duplicate charges, misclassified freight, and unexpected fees are all too common in logistics. Thats where freight invoice audits come into play.A freight invoice audit reviews, verifies, and corrects freight invoices to ensure that companies only pay for legitimate, agreed-upon charges. Whether youre a shipper, carrier, or freight broker, auditing invoices can help eliminate overcharges, improve cash flow, and identify areas for cost savings.Companies can bleed money on unnecessary expenses without regular invoice audits, leading to financial strain and reduced profitability. In this guide, well break down what freight audits involve, common billing issues they catch, and how they can help your business stay financially in the black.What Is a Freight Invoice Audit?A freight invoice audit ensures that what youre being billed matches the actual services provided. In the trucking industry, freight invoices can be complex, with multiple charges, surcharges, and accessorial fees that may not always be correct.Freight invoice audits help companies:Validate billing accuracy by checking charges against contracts and rate agreementsCatch duplicate charges, incorrect rates, and misclassified freightEnsure carriers and brokers follow agreed-upon pricing structuresImprove cash flow by preventing overpaymentsConducting routine freight audits can help companies track discrepancies, negotiate better rates, and recover overcharges, ultimately improving their financial management.How Freight Auditing WorksThe freight auditing process follows a structured approach to ensure every invoice is accurate before payment. Heres how it typically works:1. Collecting Freight InvoicesThe first step is to collect invoices from carriers, brokers, and logistics providers. These invoices may be issued per load or included in a monthly or weekly billing cycle.2. Reviewing Invoice DetailsAuditors then cross-check invoice data against shipment records, contracts, and rate agreements. They verify details such as:Shipment weights and dimensionsPickup and delivery locationsFreight classificationsTariffs and surchargesAgreed-upon base rates3. Identifying Billing ErrorsCommon errors that auditors look for include:Overcharges  rates that exceed contracted pricesDuplicate invoices  charges that appear multiple times for the same shipmentIncorrect weights/dimensions  miscalculations that raise shipping costsMisclassified freight  items categorized incorrectlyUnauthorized accessorial fees  additional charges applied without prior agreement4. Disputing ErrorsAuditors collaborate to address billing issues, request refunds, and negotiate adjustments when discrepancies arise. When audit findings are contested, supporting documentation, such as bills of lading or delivery receipts, helps resolve conflicts.5. Issuing Refund ClaimsIf an overcharge is confirmed, an auditor may file a refund claim on behalf of the company. Refunds are either credited to the companys account or applied toward future invoices.6. Generating Reports for Financial InsightsFinally, auditors compile reports detailing:Billing errors foundCost savings achievedRefunds recoveredTrends in freight costsThese reports assist companies in monitoring financial performance, spotting cost-reduction opportunities, and enhancing operational efficiency.Common Issues Found in Freight AuditsA freight audit can reveal many expensive mistakes that might otherwise escape notice. Some of the most frequent errors include:1. Incorrect Invoice ChargesOne significant issue in freight billing is overcharging. This occurs when a carrier bills more than the agreed-upon rate or imposes charges that werent authorized.2. Duplicate ChargesCompanies do not usually pay the same invoice twice, especially when different departments manage payments. Duplicate billing can also happen when multiple carriers invoice for the same load in cases of freight consolidation.3. Misclassified FreightDifferent types of freight come with varying pricing structures. The business may pay more than needed if a shipment is miscategorized into a higher-cost class.4. Incorrect Weights or DimensionsWeight, dimensions, and density typically determine freight charges. If a carrier inaccurately logs this information, shipping costs can increase.5. Unauthorized Surcharges and FeesCarriers frequently impose additional fees, including:Fuel surchargesResidential delivery feesAccessorial charges for specialized handling. While some of these fees are valid, others may be added without prior consent. Auditing invoices guarantees that these fees are adequately justified.How to Avoid Freight Invoice ErrorsCompanies should implement best freight audits and invoice management practices to prevent billing errors. Heres how:Negotiate Clear Contracts: Ensure contracts explicitly define rates, accessorial fees, and surcharge policies.Regularly Review Carrier Bills: Avoid paying invoices without verificationcompare them against your records for accuracy.Use Freight Auditing Software: Automate invoice verification to identify errors quickly.Monitor Carrier Performance: Track late deliveries, incorrect charges, and disputed claims.Work With a Freight Audit Provider: Engaging a professional freight audit service can save both time and money by efficiently managing audits.Freight Auditing Software and Automation ToolsFreight audits can be time-consuming, particularly for large operations that handle hundreds of invoices each month. Many businesses automate the process with freight audit software.Popular Freight Auditing Tools Include:Electronic Invoicing (E-Invoicing) Systems  streamline invoice collection and processing.Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Technology  automatically extracts and verifies invoice data.Cloud-Based Document Management  securely stores invoices, bills of lading, and contracts.Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems  integrate freight billing with overall business finances.Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Systems  automate invoice submissions and dispute resolutions.By automating freight invoice audits, companies can reduce human error, accelerate processing, and lower administrative overhead.A freight invoice audit is about profitability and enhancing financial efficiency. Businesses that audit their freight invoices can:Lower transportation costs by removing overchargesImprove cash flow by avoiding unnecessary expensesEnhance financial transparency with precise billing recordsStrengthen carrier relationships by effectively resolving disputes.With rising freight costs and increasingly complex logistics networks, every dollar saved through accurate invoicing adds up. Whether a business audits invoices manually, uses software or collaborates with a freight audit provider, the key is to remain proactive and ensure every shipping dollar is spent wisely.Freight audits are necessary financial safeguards for fleets, brokers, and shippers. In logistics, minor billing errors can quickly become financial losses or missed revenue.The post Freight Invoice Audits and Why They Matter appeared first on FreightWaves."

We score each lender on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).For example, regarding mortgage rates, a lender with a lower score charged a higher-than-median mortgage interest rate for loans issued in 2023. A higher score indicates that a lender granted borrowers lower-than-median home loan interest rates in 2023.With total home loan costs, a lower score would indicate that a lender charged higher-than-median total home loan costs in 2023. A high rating would mean a mortgage lender offered lower-than-median all-in home loan costs in 2023.What this means: AmeriHome offered a typical mortgage rate of 6.625% and a typical total loan cost of $6,686.60 to borrowers in 2023.To apply for an AmeriHome mortgage, you must create an account in the lenders online portal.

Using 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data comprised of 10 million home loan applications, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders. 2) Affordability. A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit. 3) Loan costs. HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median. 4) Rate transparency. The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate. We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available. 5) Online features. An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.Review of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.Advertisers or sponsorships do not influence ratings.Editorial disclosure for mortgages:The information in this article has not been reviewed or approved by any advertiser.

        "content": "Legislation reintroduced Tuesday in the House of Representatives would establish a 10% tax credit to help upgrade and expand the U.S. freight car fleet.The Freight Rail Assets Investment to Launch Commercial Activity Revitalization Act (Freight Railcar) Act of 2025 was reintroduced in the House by Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood and Democrat Brad Schneider, with 40 original bipartisan co-sponsors.The bill was originally introduced in 2023.The three-year, 10% tax credit is designed to help offset the costs associated with replacing two existing railcars with a new railcar that improves fuel efficiency or capacity by at least 8%, or refurbishing or modernizing an existing railcar to improve fuel efficiency or capacity by at least 8%, or to upgrade tank cars to DOT-117 specifications.Illinois rail network is a vital economic driver that impacts agriculture, manufacturing, and our local communities, said LaHood, in a release. I am proud to reintroduce the Freight Railcar Act of 2025 alongside Rep. Schneider to spur job growth and strengthen the United States infrastructure. Not only will this legislation improve the efficiency of railcars, but it will address supply chain constraints and support American manufacturing jobs.Our rail network is crucial for commuters, farmers, and manufacturers all across Illinois and any weakness in that network is not only a short-term inconvenience but has long term consequences for our supply chain, said Schneider, also in the release. I am proud to introduce this legislation with my colleague, Rep. LaHood, so we can bring our rail fleet into the 21st century and promote quality, well-paying jobs in the rail sector.LaHood is the son of Ray LaHood, who served as transportation secretary under President Barack Obama.The tax credit expires three years after enactment of the legislation and is limited to 1,000 new freight cars per taxpayer per year. Existing railcars must have been in service during the 48 months prior to enactment.The credit applies to privately or publicly owned cars not under control of a state-owned or -supported entity.We are incredibly grateful for the leadership of Representatives LaHood and Schneider in reintroducing the Freight RAILCAR Act, said Erik Olson, executive director of the Rail Security Alliance, in a release. This bill is key to ensuring American economic and national security. It not only supports our domestic freight railcar manufacturing and supply industry and the jobs tied to the sector, but guarantees supply chain reliability and the ability to move goods on U.S.-made rail assets.The RSA represents builders, suppliers and other companies in the railcar business.Approximately 250,000 rail cars will need to be updated over the next 15 years, according to the RSA.The current North American railcar fleet comprises more than 1.6 million railcars with approximately 321,000 of those in storage.A number of U.S.-based railcar builders, such as Greenbrier, Trinity and FreightCar America, maintain manufacturing facilities in Mexico. It was not immediately clear if the tax credit would apply to cars built there for the North American market. A Greenbrier spokesman said the Portland, Oregon-based company had no comment on the bill.We anticipate both direct and indirect new jobs in the United States from this legislation, said Olson, in an email to FreightWaves. Modernizing or replacing a significant portion of the aging railcar fleet stimulates demand for domestic steel, components, and assembly work, boosting both railcar manufacturer and supply-chain employment. Even though some U.S.-headquartered railcar builders operate facilities in Mexico, this tax credit is designed to strengthen the entire North American supply chain.The measure harks back to the Incentive Per Diem legislation of the 70s that financed construction of 40,000 new boxcars. A loophole in the scheme helped build outsized fleets and generate returns for shortline railroads and investment firms but ultimately collapsed in the recession of the early 80s.The new measure would protect 65,000 American manufacturing jobs in the rail sector, invest in modern, more efficient railcars that will increase economic productivity, while reducing the sectors carbon footprint; and help the rail supply industry expand and thrive in the current economic climate, the bill states.The bill awaits cost evaluation by the Joint Committee on Taxation, but Olson said supporters are actively working to get the legislation into the upcoming tax legislation likely to move through Congress this year.This article was update Feb. 12 with additional comments from Erik Olson of RSA.Subscribe to FreightWaves e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Find more articles by Stuart Chirls here.Related coverage:Short line eyes Cali market, buys hydrogen locomotive builderCeremony marks CPKC opening of second US-Mexico rail bridgeRailcar builder CEO Tekorius appointed to Federal Reserve branchWeekly US rail traffic back ahead of 2024 levelsThe post Tax credit would upgrade, expand US rail freight car fleet  appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "source": "Reuters",
        "content": "By Florence Tan and Nidhi VermaSINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tightened U.S. sanctions on Moscow have disrupted a roaring trade in discounted Russian oil to China and India, reviving demand for Middle Eastern and African crudes, roiling shipping markets and driving up oil prices.Washington's January 10 sanctions targeted tankers carrying Russian oil in a push to more effectively limit Moscow's oil revenue, the aim of western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine three years ago.The new rules have left millions of barrels floating on ships and sent traders hunting for alternatives, while dealings in Russian crude, the biggest source for top global importers China and India, have slowed for March.The scramble has upended market dynamics. For a few weeks, high-sulphur benchmark Dubai became more expensive than low-sulphur Brent, which is easier to process. That opened opportunities for producers from Brazil to Kazakhstan to gain share in China and India.Premiums for Brazilian crude surged last month to about $5 a barrel against dated Brent on cost and freight basis to China, up from about $2 in the previous month, traders said. That premium is now just below $5 a barrel for May arrival cargoes.In March, China is set to import its first cargo since June 2024 of Kazakhstan's CPC Blend, Kpler data showed.In the week after the new sanctions, TotalEnergies' trading arm TOTSA received so many enquiries that it held tenders instead of private negotiations to sell its Middle Eastern crude cargoes, which eventually went to China's CNOOC and Rongsheng Petrochemical, a Singapore-based trader said.TotalEnergies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Reflecting the rush for Middle Eastern crudes, premiums for benchmarks Oman, Dubai and Murban more than doubled in January from December and remain above $3 a barrel to Dubai, despite lower demand from refineries in seasonal maintenance.In addition, top exporter Saudi Aramco hiked prices for Asia-bound crude to the highest since December 2023, raising costs for refiners.A seller of Angolan crude said there was an increase in demand from Asian buyers looking to cover.\"Unipec is taking a lot West African crude cargoes, especially Angolan barrels - good buying interest after the Lunar New Year,\" a Chinese trader said. Unipec is the trading arm of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.With sanctioned ships stuck on the water, many traders have rushed to switch to other vessels which now cost multiple times more, adding millions of dollars to the expense of each shipment.INDIA SCRAMBLESThe rising costs are particularly tough for refiners in India. The country late last year cemented its shift from long-standing Middle Eastern sources to buy more oil from Russia, when Reliance Industries struck a 10-year supply deal with Russian state giant Rosneft worth roughly $13 billion annually.This week, India's oil secretary said the country's refiners want to buy only Russian oil supplied by companies and ships not sanctioned by the U.S. That has effectively reduced the number of cargoes and vessels available, Indian refining sources said.With a limited supply of sanctions-proof cargoes, discounts for Russian Urals crude to dated Brent have narrowed to $2.50-$2.90 a barrel for March delivery, versus $3-$3.50 before the January sanctions, they said, a major cost increase on a typical one million barrel cargo.Higher Russian crude costs have narrowed the price gap with Middle East crude to about $3 a barrel from $6-$7 for Indian refiners, offering little incentive to risk incurring secondary sanctions, Indian refining sources said.Indian buyers turned down offers from Russian shipping giant Sovcomflot to receive payments in any currencies, including Indian rupees, for Russian oil shipped on sanctioned tankers, the sources said, after its CEO met buyers in India on the sidelines of the India Energy Week conference this week. Sovcomflot declined to comment.The slowdown has meant that Russian oil stored aboard ships has increased by 17 million barrels since January 10, according to a February 5 note from Goldman Sachs, and is expected to rise to 50 million barrels in the first half of 2025.\"We're seeing floating volume pick up. There's a number of tankers carrying Russian oil hanging out around Shandong and southern ports in China that are normally not big entry points,\" said a senior executive at a major global trading house.Shandong province is the hub for independent Chinese refiners that have been core buyers of discounted sanctioned oil from Russia as well as Iran and Venezuela.IRAN'S OUTPUT TARGETEDThe Russian supply disruption comes on top of falling Iranian oil imports by top customer China amid tightening U.S. pressure, with President Donald Trump recently vowing to bring Tehran's oil exports to zero.Goldman Sachs estimated Iranian floating storage has risen by 14 million barrels since the start of the year to its highest in 14 months. Tighter sanctions enforcement could cut Iran's output by 1 million barrels per day and push Brent to the high $80s a barrel by May, the analysts said.The squeeze on cheap crude into China, coupled with weak domestic demand, has led several independent refiners to shut for maintenance instead of losing 500 yuan ($68.62) for every ton of non-sanctioned crude processed based on offers at $7-$8 a barrel above ICE Brent delivered to China, a trader said.China's state refiners, meanwhile, are likely to shun Russian oil as sanctions reduce the number of counterparties and insurers for such transactions, while key ports such as Qingdao and Rizhao have become stricter, said a source with knowledge of the matter.The person estimated Russian export volumes to China would fall by between 700,000 and 800,000 barrels per day from March, after sanctions waivers lapse. That would amount to at least a 70% decline from January, according to Kpler data.WARNEDWeeks before the sanctions were announced in a 27-page document, Indian refiners were warned by authorities and made some purchases in advance, industry officials said. The Indian government did not respond to a request for comment on whether refiners were warned in advance.In China, the Shandong Port Group issued a ban three days earlier on sanctioned ships from calling at its ports, although it is not clear whether the move was related.Other signs that markets were anticipating new measures included higher demand for Middle East and African crude from Chinese and Indian buyers, and a rush to charter ships that subsequently drove up tanker rates sharply, traders said.Adi Imsirovic, director of consultancy Surrey Clean Energy, and former oil trader at Russia's Gazprom, said the impact of the sanctions may curb Russian exports by up to 1.5 million barrels per day in the near-term.\"The only true prediction that we can make is that the market is just going to get more volatile. With more and more government intervention in the markets, it's just going to get more volatile,\" he said.($1 = 7.2870 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore and Nidhi Verma in New Delhi; additional reporting by Siyi Liu and Chen Aizhu in Singapore, Anna Hirtenstein, Alex Lawler, Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by Tony Munroe and Sonali Paul)"

        "content": "The freight market is volatile, and spot rates fluctuate daily, sometimes in real time, making it challenging for carriers to secure consistent, profitable loads. Many small fleets and owner-operators turn to load boards and brokers to find freight, but relying solely on the spot market is rarely a winning long-term strategy. Many fleets struggle to turn serious profits on spot-rate freight because the model often favors shippers and brokers over carriers.So, how can trucking companies secure better, more consistent rates and avoid the roller coaster of load board pricing? The answer lies in establishing direct relationships with shippers. While spot freight has its place, direct shipper contracts provide stability, better margins and predictable revenue, which are critical for long-term success.Understanding Spot Freight Rates and Why They FluctuateSpot freight rates are one-time pricing agreements for moving a load. The rates are determined by real-time market conditions and fluctuate based on capacity, fuel costs and supply chain disruptions. While spot rates offer flexibility, they lack consistency and make it difficult for carriers to plan for a steady income.Several key factors influence spot freight rates:Market demand and capacity  If more freight is available than trucks, rates increase. If too many trucks chase too few loads, rates drop.Fuel prices and operational costs  Rising fuel prices directly impact freight rates, making long-haul loads less profitable when fuel costs surge.Urgency of the shipment  Last-minute loads often pay a premium, but shippers may still secure cheap rates through desperate carriers if capacity is low.Seasonality and freight volume  Peak seasons (e.g., produce season and holiday shipping) drive up rates, whereas slow seasons leave many carriers competing for limited freight.While spot rates may occasionally work in a carriers favor, they are highly unpredictable. This makes it difficult for owner-operators and small fleets to plan fuel purchases, maintenance schedules and long-term financial decisions.The Load Board Problem and Why Spot Freight Doesnt Always PayLoad boards are necessary for many carriers, especially those just starting out. Platforms like DAT, Truckstop and Convoy offer access to available freight but come with significant downsides:Rate compression  With hundreds of carriers competing for the same loads, brokers drive rates down, maximizing their profits while carriers accept minimal margins.Inconsistent freight  Loads posted on load boards are often last-minute, leftover or overflow freight. Shippers give their best lanes to contracted carriers, leaving the least desirable freight for the spot market.Lack of direct relationships  Since brokers and 3PLs control the freight, carriers rarely build direct ties with shippers, making it harder to negotiate better rates.Short-term thinking: Carriers that rely exclusively on spot market loads are at the mercy of rate swings, which prevent them from scaling their businesses.Fleets that are dependent on load boards struggle to grow. The most profitable carriers move beyond transactional freight and secure direct contracts with shippers, providing them with consistent loads at stable rates.Why Direct Shipper Freight is the AnswerUnlike load board freight, direct shipper relationships provide carriers with steady work and better pricing. Instead of chasing loads in a cutthroat market, carriers that establish direct agreements benefit from:Stable, predictable revenue  No more gambling on whether next weeks rates will be good or bad.Less competition  When you work directly with shippers, you avoid the rate wars seen on load boards.Negotiable rates  Shippers value reliability and loyal carriers can negotiate better long-term rates than those found in the volatile spot market.Faster payments  Instead of waiting for brokers to process invoices, direct shippers typically pay on net terms or offer quick pay options.Consistent freight lanes  Direct contracts allow carriers to haul dedicated freight, reducing deadhead miles and improving efficiency.A small reefer carrier hauling produce may struggle to maintain steady rates in the spot market, especially outside peak season. However, securing a direct contract with a regional grocery distributor could provide weekly loads at a fixed rate, ensuring stable income year-round.How to Secure Direct Shipper FreightTransitioning from load board freight to direct shipper contracts takes time, but the effort is well worth it. Heres how carriers can start landing direct shipper freight:Identify Potential Shippers in Your RegionLook for manufacturers, distributors and retailers that ship regularly in your preferred lanes. Focus on industries that match your equipment, such as:Dry van  Consumer goods, food and beverage, electronics.Reefer  Grocery chains, frozen food distributors, pharmaceutical companies.Flatbed  Construction materials, industrial equipment, steel and lumber suppliers.Intermodal and drayage  Port and rail freight, container movements.Use Google, LinkedIn and industry directories to find potential shippers.Leverage Load Boards for Initial Shipper ConnectionsWhile load boards arent ideal for long-term profitability, they can be a starting point for building shipper relationships. If you consistently move loads for a specific shipper, ask about direct agreements instead of going through a broker.Cold Call and Email Shippers DirectlyOne of the most effective strategies is contacting shippers directly. Call logistics managers or send professional emails introducing your services. Highlight:Your equipment type and coverage areas.Your safety and service record.How you can help reduce their transportation costs and improve reliability.Persistence is key. Not every shipper will say yes immediately, but staying in touch increases your chances.Attend Industry Events and Join Networking GroupsTrade shows, trucking associations and logistics networking events connect carriers with shippers looking for reliable transportation partners. Some events to consider:Mid-America Trucking Show (MATS)FreightWaves eventsSpecialized transportation and logistics exposOffer Exceptional Service and ReliabilityShippers want dependability. If you secure a one-off load from a shipper, treat it as an opportunity to prove your value. Deliver on time, communicate effectively and avoid service failures. A good first impression can lead to consistent, direct freight opportunities.Why Spot Freight Isnt Always the Long-Term AnswerWhile spot freight has its place, it is not a sustainable strategy for growth and profitability. Many carriers lose money or break even chasing the next load at a low margin. The key to long-term trucking success is establishing direct shipper freight, which ensures stable revenue, consistent freight lanes and reduced competition.Carriers that focus on building direct relationships, providing exceptional service and strategically targeting shippers will find themselves far stronger than those relying solely on the uncertain world of spot market freight.If youre tired of fighting for low-paying loads on load boards, its time to pivot your business strategy toward direct shipper contracts, the key to financial stability in trucking.The post Maximizing Spot Rates While Leveraging Direct Shipper Freight appeared first on FreightWaves."

In other words, even if you've never had a credit card or loan, your history with checking and savings accounts can help you build up a credit score.This embedded content is not available in your region.\"TruVision Alternative Bank Risk Score provides a balanced view by incorporating both positive and negative banking data,\" said Liz Pagel, senior vice president of consumer lending at TransUnion. \"This can help consumers with limited or no credit history gain access to credit, ultimately promoting financial inclusion and stability.So far, TransUnion is tight-lipped about the finer details of its new scoring model, but Pagel shared that it ranges from 500 to 900, and it will be used exclusively when consumers apply for unsecured loans (i.e., loans with no collateral).When you apply for a personal loan, many lenders look at your traditional credit scores to determine if you qualify. But now, they can also choose to pull your TruVision Alternative Bank Risk Score from TransUnion.When will a lender pull this score? TransUnion just introduced the TruVision Alternative Bank Risk Score, so your lender may not have access to it just yet. But as it becomes more widely adopted, lenders are most likely to pull this score if you don't have a credit history, or if you don't qualify for a loan based on your traditional credit scores.Instead of simply declining your application, the lender can use this new score calculator to evaluate your last five years of checking and savings account history and determine if you qualify.Read more: 10 tips to improve your credit score in 2025TransUnion says it uses both positive and negative data from your banking history, but the credit bureau declined to specify which data is weighed into their new score.To get a sense of what might be included, consider other reports and scores that are based on your banking information, such as those from ChexSystems and Early Warning Services (EWS). These companies compile your negative banking information, including instances where you abused an account or committed fraud. Here's some of the information they consider:Account applications: Number and frequency.Account closures: Involuntary account closures and the reasons for the closures.Unpaid bills: Overdrafts and bank fees you haven't paid.Check-writing history: Returned checks, bounced checks, and check fraud.If you want to learn more about your banking history, you can pull your ChexSystems report and/or EWS report (both are free to pull once a year) and give them a review.Read more: Does closing a bank account hurt your credit score?The details around how TruVision Alternative Bank Risk Scores are calculated are still fuzzy, so we can only make an educated guess about how to improve them. Like with credit cards and loans, healthy account management habits are likely the key.Here are a few healthy habits to practice when it comes to banking:Limit your applications for new bank accounts.Avoid overdrafts and unpaid bank fees.Pay off any negative balances or bank fees ASAP.Only write checks when you have the money to back them.If you're not qualified to open your own bank account, ask a loved one with good banking history to add you to their account as a joint owner.Never open a joint bank account with someone who has a history of banking problems.Read more: 7 ways to build credit  without a credit cardIn order to get a credit score from FICO, you need to either have a credit card or loan open for at least six months, or you need to have one or more accounts that have been reported to the credit bureaus in the last six months.If you want to open your first credit card or loan but don't qualify, consider asking a loved one with good credit to add you as an authorized user on one of their credit cards. If that's not an option, try applying for a secured credit card.If you've been turned down for a new checking account, look for a bank or credit union that offers \"second chance\" accounts, which are meant for people with past banking issues. If you still don't qualify, consider using a bank-issued prepaid card for some of your banking needs.Read more: Here's what to do if your bank account application was deniedTransUnion hasn't released a list of lenders who use their TruVision Alternative Bank Risk Score.

        "content": "(Reuters) -China oversaw its largest-ever wave of rural bank mergers last year, a Reuters review of official data showed, but analysts say Beijing's efforts to tackle risks in the small banking sector could end up creating more problems down the road.Many of the roughly 4,000 small Chinese banks are backed by indebted provincial governments and largely funded via short-term money market and interbank borrowings, potentially jeopardising financial stability in the event a few of them fail.The move comes at a time when many of these smaller banks have been hit hard by slowing loan growth and a spike in bad loans amid a property sector crisis and a prolonged downturn in the world's no. 2 economy.At least 290 rural Chinese banks and rural cooperatives were merged into larger regional lenders in 2024, according to Reuters calculation of regulatory and company filings over the past 12 months.The scale of the mergers, which have not been reported previously, underscore the depth of the problem in a crucial corner of China's financial sector.It's also the most sweeping consolidation since China's small rural commercial banks were transformed in early 2000 from socialist-style, rural cooperatives to serve farmers and small enterprises overlooked by major state banks.China's rural or small banking sector has about 3,700 firms with a combined 57 trillion yuan ($7.8 trillion) in assets as of the end of June last year, roughly twice the size of Australia's banking sector and one-third the size of the United States.\"After years of clean-up the banking system is in relatively good health despite the weakening economic backdrop,\" said Jason Bedford, a former Asia analyst with Bridgewater and UBS, known for his in-depth research on the Chinese banking sector.However, often these mergers simply create \"larger troubled banks\" by combining insolvent institutions, said Bedford.China's banking regulator, the National Financial Regulatory Authority, did not respond to Reuters request for comment.SOARING BAD LOANSOver the past decade, many small banks started aggressively lending to property developers and local government financing vehicles.That practice made them vulnerable to the post-COVID economic downturn, the property market upheaval, and the weakening financials of the indebted local governments.Rural commercial banks' bad loan ratio hit 3.04% in the third quarter of last year, nearly double the overall banking sector's 1.56%, show the latest official data. Analysts say the financial health of many small lenders is in a much worse state.In one of the most elaborate merger exercises last year, the government in northeast China's Liaoning province in September 2023 set up Liaoning Rural Commercial Bank with 20.8 billion yuan in registered capital.Liaoning Rural Commercial Bank then absorbed 36 local small rural lenders in June last year. Many of the absorbed lenders were struggling with soaring bad loans, the Reuters review of filings showed.Liaoning Dengta Rural Commercial Bank, one of the 36 institutions, reported a 21.54% bad loan ratio at the end of 2021, compared with a sector average of 1.73% at that time, the bank's latest available disclosures showed.Liaoning Rural Commercial Bank's balance sheet has not been made public yet. The lender did not respond to a request for comment.In a more recent consolidation move, Lanzhou Bank, based in northwestern Gansu province, received regulatory approval to acquire two rural banks, the country's banking sector regulator said in statement in December.As part of those acquisitions, financial details of which were not made public, the two banks' assets will be transferred to Lanzhou Bank, which had 453 billion yuan in assets and 1.73% bad loan ratio as of end-2023, its annual report showed.Chinas mainland banking index is up roughly 10% this year, having gained nearly 40% last year buoyed by hopes of recapitalisation of big lenders.'CASH MACHINES'The small banks merger drive is part of reforms launched by Chinese authorities in 2022 to overhaul the rural banking sector and clean up struggling smaller lenders, after a series of scandals that in some cases saw depositors losing money and holding rare public protests.Ten other small banks in the Liaoning province are set to be merged into Liaoshen Bank, established in June 2021 to absorb 12 smaller regional lenders, according to official disclosures seen by Reuters.Highlighting the risk of the merger drive creating bigger troubled banks, Liaoshen Bank inherited large amount of soured assets from the acquisition of two smaller banks, resulting in its bad loan ratio hitting 4.67% in 2022 and 4.53% in 2023.That's substantially higher than the 1.75% average among city commercial banks.\"The two original banks had insufficient quality assets, large high-interest liabilities... unbalanced business structure, and weak operational management,\" Liaoshen Bank said in its 2022 annual report, adding it's still not a 'normal bank.'Liaoshen Bank did not respond to a request for comment.Some rural institutions had become shareholders' \"cash machines\" and had strayed from their mission of supporting the agricultural sector and small businesses, the central bank said in a report released in December 2023.\"The problem is that there are so many small regional banks that the banking regulator clearly doesn't have the capacity to monitor them all,\" said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics.These consolidations will create fewer, larger institutions that regulators can supervise more effectively, he said, but the strategy would not resolve issues like bad assets and \"plenty of problems\" will remain.(Reporting by Ziyi Tang and Ryan Woo in Beijing; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Shri Navaratnam)"

        "content": "Ever since the Federal Reserve began lowering the federal funds rate late last year, deposit account rates have been on the decline as well.The good news: You can lock in a competitive return on a certificate of deposit (CD) today and preserve your earning power. Read on for a snapshot of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.CD rates have remained high by historical standards, especially for shorter terms. For example, it's possible to find rates of 4.00% APY or higher for terms of about one year and under. Although interest rates for longer-term CDs aren't quite as high, the best available rates still hover near 3%-4% APY for terms of three years or more.Today, the highest CD rate 4.35% APY, offered by LendingClub on its 10-month CD. A minimum opening deposit of $2,500 is required.Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:This embedded content is not available in your region.See our picks for the best CD accounts available today>>CD rates are tied to the federal funds rate; when the Fed increases its target rate, deposit account rates usually follow suit, and vice versa.The Fed held interest rates steady for most of 2024, with a target rate of 5.25%-5.50%. However, as inflation cooled and economic growth improved, it finally slashed the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September, and another 25 basis points in November and December. Today, the federal funds rate stands at 4.25%-4.75%. Experts believe there will be additional rate cuts in 2025.As a result, CD rates have begun falling. That means now might be the last chance for savers to lock in todays higher CD rates.Read more: APY vs. interest rate: Whats the difference?Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on several factors. Earning a competitive interest rate is important, but its not the only consideration to keep in mind. Heres a closer look at some of these key factors to think about:Interest rates: CDs make for a more attractive investment option when interest rates are high or trending downward since they lock in the current rate for the entire term. Considering the recent trends in interest rates, it could be a good time to put your money in a CD and secure a guaranteed rate of return.Financial goals: CDs are a safe investment choice if you're looking to preserve capital and earn a steady return. They are insured by the FDIC up to the federal limit and cant lose money in most cases, making them a low-risk option. That said, if youre saving for a long-term goal like retirement, a CD may not be the best choice since market investments tend to provide higher returns, on average.Liquidity needs: CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term. If you think youll need to access your money before the term ends, you may want to avoid CDs, as they come with early withdrawal penalties. A high-yield savings account or other type of deposit account may be a better option.Read more: How much do you need to open a CD?CDs are available from most banks. However, if youre interested in opening a CD, its important to look beyond your current bank. Not all CDs offer competitive rates, even in a high interest rate environment. Thats why comparing multiple CD account options is important, especially among financial institutions that are known for offering higher rates.Online banks: One of the best places to find high-yield CDs is online banks. Since they are less expensive to operate than traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks can pass on those savings to customers in the form of lower fees and higher rates on deposits. So, if youre interested in opening a CD with a high rate, online institutions are a great place to start.Credit unions: As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions tend to offer better rates and lower fees than for-profit banks. Research the local credit unions in your area, as well as online credit unions, and find out if you qualify to join any.Community banks: Local banks strive to serve their communities and often provide more affordable and personalized service than large, national banks. They also typically offer more competitive interest rates on deposits.Read more: Can you gift a CD?This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries, gasoline and rents rose, a disappointment for families and businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the Federal Reserve's resolve to delay further interest rate cuts.The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesdays report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September.The new data shows that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months after it fell steadily for about a year and a half. Elevated prices turned into a major political hurdle for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices on Day 1\" if elected, though most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs.The unexpected boost in inflation could dampen some of the business enthusiasm that arose after Trump's election on promises to reduce regulation and cut taxes. The Dow fell 400 points in mid-day trading Wednesday. Bond yields rose, a sign traders expect inflation and interest rates to remain high.We're really not making progress on inflation right now, Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. This just extends the Fed's hold.Inflation often jumps in January as many companies raise their prices at the beginning of the year, though the governments seasonal adjustment process is supposed to filter out those effects.Yet House said inflation's stubbornness wasn't just a one-month blip. Consumers  particularly wealthier ones  are still spending at a robust pace, giving many companies less reason to hold down prices. And much of the decline in inflation in 2023 and early last year stemmed from supply-chain improvements, but that trend has mostly played out.Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core consumer prices rose 3.3% in January compared with a year ago, up from 3.2% in December. Economists closely watch core prices because they can provide a better read of inflation's future path.Inflation also worsened on a monthly basis, with prices jumping 0.5% in January from December, the largest increase since August 2023. Core prices climbed 0.4% last month, the most since March 2024.Grocery prices climbed 0.5% just in January, pushed higher by a 15.2% surge in egg prices, the biggest monthly increase since June of 2015. Egg prices have soared 53% compared with a year ago.An avian flu epidemic has forced egg producers to cull from their flocks about 40 million birds in December and January. Stores have imposed limits on egg purchases and restaurants have placed surcharges on egg dishes.The cost of car insurance continues to rise, and picked up 2% just from December to January. Hotel prices rose 1.4% last month, while the cost of a gallon of gas moved up 1.8%.Trumps tariffs are making life more complicated for Phil Hannon, vice president of operations at Abt, a consumer electronics store in Glenview, Illinois. Roughly 60% of Abts sales are appliances, big and small. The rest are in consumer electronics like TVs and computers, and furniture.Hannon expects to raise prices between 3% and 15% as soon as March to offset the impact of tariffs, including the steel and aluminum duties.Hes received notices from vendors over the past two weeks warning about eventual price increases, though theyre not specific. To get ahead of the cost increases, Hannon has been locking in orders from suppliers for up to 90 days.Hannon said that many customers are already asking about price increases and when the tariffs are coming. He started seeing a noticeable pickup of customers ordering products like washing machines this month to get ahead of the tariffs.Separately, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that the Fed has made great progress on inflation but we're not quite there yet.\"\"Today's inflation print ... says the same thing,\" he added. As a result, the Fed wants to keep rates restrictive for now,\" he said. At its current level, the Fed's key rate is restricting borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, Powell has said.With inflation down significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022, the Fed cut its rate to about 4.3% in its final three meetings last year. It raised its benchmark rate in 2022 and 2023 to a two-decade high of 5.3% to combat inflation.The Feds rate typically influences other borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards.Early Wednesday, Trump said on social media that interest rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Yet the tick up in consumer prices makes it less likely the Fed will cut rates anytime soon.One sign of concern for economists is that goods prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.3% in January from the previous month. Prices for cars, furniture, and appliances had been flat or falling after supply-chain kinks stemming from the pandemic were resolved. Yet now those prices have ticked up even before tariffs have been launched.Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, which could push the cost of cars, appliances, and industrial machinery higher. He also said earlier this week he would impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that have high duties on U.S. goods.Theres just a stew of uncertainty that if it lasts and lingers over the next couple months, you could see business confidence come down, Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said. That could reduce hiring and investment, he said.On Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that higher tariffs could lift inflation and limit the central bank's ability to cut rates, calling it a possible outcome.But he emphasized that it would depend on how many imports are hit with tariffs and for how long.In some cases it doesnt reach the consumer much, and in some cases it does, Powell said. And it really does depend on facts that we we havent seen yet.___AP Retail Writer Anne D'Innocenzio contributed to this report from New York."

This is the case for all loan types and programs.Learn more: 5 ways to get the lowest mortgage rates possibleYahoo Finance uses 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data of 10 million home loan applications to score mortgage lenders on issued interest rates and total loan costs. We score each lender on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).For example, regarding mortgage interest rates, a lender with a lower score charged a higher-than-median mortgage interest rate for loans issued in 2023. A higher score indicates that a lender granted borrowers lower-than-median home loan interest rates in 2023.With total home loan costs, a lower score would indicate that a lender charged higher-than-median total home loan costs in 2023. A high rating would mean that a mortgage lender offered lower-than-median all-in home loan costs in 2023.What this means: Freedom Mortgage offered a higher-than-median mortgage rate of 6.75% and a high total loan cost of $12,003.20 to borrowers in 2023.Freedom Mortgage doesnt have physical branches you can visit to apply in person, but it does offer online and over-the-phone mortgage applications. To start the process, call 888-369-3719 and speak to a loan officer, or fill out an application online. The online application will require information about the property youre buying, your personal details, your down payment amount, your income, and more.We couldnt find a preapproval process on Freedoms website, but the lender does offer prequalification. Generally speaking, prequalification is a lighter lift than preapproval, requiring only some basic information about your finances and homebuying goals, while preapproval asks for financial documents and other verification tools.With prequalification, youll get an estimate of how much you can potentially borrow for your home purchase, which can help you determine what price range to shop in. Preapproval, on the other hand, is more official, indicating youll likely get approved for your loan  as long as you meet certain conditions.At Freedom, you can get prequalified for a mortgage in two ways: either by applying online or by calling a loan officer. In both scenarios, youll need to answer a few questions about your income, down payment, and other financial factors, as well as the home youre looking to buy. Youll also need to agree to a credit check, too. From there, youll get a prequalification letter lasting up to 90 days.Read more: How mortgage prequalification worksAs far as online tools go, Freedom offers quite a few.

        "content": "By Douglas Gillison, Nupur Anand, Pete Schroeder and Isla Binnie(Reuters) - At a JPMorgan townhall meeting on Wednesday, CEO Jamie Dimon was asked whether the Trump administration's decision to abruptly stop work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and question its existence was good news for the industry.Dimon told his employees that it was hard for the bank when \"policies flip back and forth\" and that he preferred consistent policies. The CFPB had some good consumer protection rules, especially when it came to areas like payday lenders, he said, according to a recording of the meeting that Reuters reviewed, which has not been previously reported. Still, he was not mourning the dismantling of the agency.\"The only good I'll say about the CFPB is there are consumer protection rules that are good,\" said Dimon. He added that the agency had \"massively overstepped their authority\" and used an expletive to describe the former CFPB director, Rohit Chopra, a Democrat who led an aggressive enforcement campaign against the industry. JPMorgan was among three banks the CFPB sued in December, alleging \"widespread\" fraud on the Zelle payment service.JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokesperson for Chopra declined to comment.Established in 2010 to protect consumers after lax mortgage rules and other shoddy industry practices led to the financial crisis of 2008, the CFPB has been reviled by conservatives and the industry, which has accused it of overreach and overzealous enforcement actions.Even so, its abrupt undoing over a weekend by the Trump administration, including by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is causing upheaval among those it regulates, according to half a dozen people who either advise or work at banks or financial technology firms regulated by the CFPB.The sudden halt of work has a swath of consequences: it leaves much of consumer finance, from mortgage companies to payment apps, unsupervised, and removes a venue where consumers could file complaints about their providers. It also leaves many investigations hanging in the balance, according to the industry advisers as well as several current and former CFPB staffers.In the industry, which has had a flurry of conversations to assess the impact of the CFPB's neutering, concern is emerging that a patchwork of state regulators could take on issues the CFPB had led, potentially leaving them with even more onerous requirements, the industry insiders said.Some executives also raised concerns during industry calls about DOGE's access to their proprietary data that CFPB collects and questioned who Musk's team was accountable to, given the billionaire entrepreneur's plans for his own competing payments business, said one public policy executive at a fintech company.Musk and President Donald Trump have both said the entrepreneur's role at DOGE does not present any conflict of interest.The CFPB holds vast amounts of data, including confidential supervisory reports, examination findings, investigative records and compliance records that include personal information for customers, their accounts, transaction histories and product preferences.Industry executives said they were worried about the seeming lack of a plan in place.\"That's something banks have always been concerned about -- patchwork regulation as opposed to knowing who you are dealing with,\" said James Ballentine, a former lobbyist with the trade group American Bankers Association who now runs his own consulting firm. \"It's easy to say, 'Let's get rid of something,' but there has to be a plan in place.\"Spokespeople for the White House, CFPB, and DOGE did not respond to requests for comment. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.REGULATORY VOIDWhether the agency continues to exist in some form and what its function would be is still to be seen. The White House nominated Jonathan McKernan, a former member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as full-time director of the CFPB, leading some analysts to suspect the administration does not want to eradicate it entirely. McKernan did not respond to a request for comment.The industrys mixed feelings of relief and concern underscore how the Trump administrations sweeping remake of the federal government is likely to lead to consequences that are not fully understood.On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that no other federal regulator was enforcing several consumer finance laws in its absence. Some experts said the regulatory void could leave everyday Americans vulnerable to predatory practices, especially from the lightly regulated parts of the financial industry and erode trust overall.\"Banking is about trust, and it's an industry that disfavors regulatory uncertainty,\" said Matthew Biben, who co-heads law firm King & Spalding's global financial services group. So the longer-term question is, What impact will the new direction have on consumer trust and regulatory certainty for market participants?BOOKS CLOSED, LAPTOPS LEFT BEHINDWhile the writing was on the wall for the CFPB, the speed of events has left the industry and staffers stunned.On Feb 7, a Friday night, Trump appointed Russell Vought as the acting director of the CFPB. Vought, who is also Trumps budget director, was one of the architects of Project 2025, a conservative manifesto published by the Heritage Foundation that called for the CFPB's abolition.A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget, which Vought leads, did not respond to a request for comment.Vought quickly ordered a temporary closure of the agency. One of the CFPB staffers said they had such little warning that many employees had left their laptops and personal effects, such as family photos, kids' artwork and potted plants, on their desks.Another staffer said hundreds of bank examiners who were set to go and examine the books at banks and other financial firms on Monday had to change travel plans. Enforcement attorneys turned off their computers mid-way through document reviews on investigations, this person said.This week, those challenging or facing action from the CFPB were trying to figure out whether they would have to continue to pursue or defend against those cases. Cases are pending against companies including Capital One, which was accused of cheating customers in high interest accounts; Meta, which said it was being probed about advertising financial products; and Experian, which faces a lawsuit alleging it mishandled complaints.Meta declined comment. Experian and Capital One did not respond to requests for comment.\"There are a lot of organizations that are currently under investigation that are wondering what it means ... and if potentially, the investigations will be closed,\" said Anastasia Stull, a partner at Stinson law firm, which represents financial clients including some involved in lawsuits with the CFPB.(Reporting by Douglas Gillison, Pete Schroeder, Nupur Anand, Hannah Lang and Isla Binnie; additional reporting by Lananh Nguyen and Tatiana Bautzer; Writing by Megan Davies; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)"

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP)  U.S. wholesale prices came in hotter than expected last month at a time when progress against inflation appears to have stalled, undercutting expectations for lower interest rates this year.The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index  which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers  rose 0.4% from December and 3.5% from January 2024. Forecasters had expected a 0.2% change month over month and 3.2% year over year.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core producer prices rose 0.3% last month from December and 3.6% from a year earlier.Wholesale services prices rose 0.3%, pushed higher by increasing hotel costs. Goods services climbed 0.6% on higher energy prices.The wholesale price report arrived a day after the Labor Department delivered some bad news about inflation at the consumer level. Its consumer price index rose 3% in January from a year ago, up from a 2.9% year-over-year increase in December.Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserves preferred inflation gauge  the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.Inflation flared up in early 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, overwhelming factories, ports and freight yards and leading to shortages, delays and higher prices.In response, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate  the fed funds rate  11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation began tumbling  from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022 to a low of 2.4% in September, tantalizingly close to the central bank's 2% target. The Fed was satisfied enough to reverse course and cut its rate three times in the last four months of 2024.Then the improvement on inflation stopped. Year-over-year consumer price inflation has now risen for four straight months.And economists and financial markets are worried that President Donald Trump's policies will push inflation higher yet. His tariffs on foreign goods and plans to deport millions of undocumented workers could translate into higher prices.In response to stubborn inflation, the Fed may hold off on further rate cuts. Back in December, it signaled that it expected to cut two more times in 2025. That seems far less likely now. Wall Street investors anticipate only rate cut this year and don't expect that one until October."

Gold was set for a seventh straight week of gains. [GOL/]But a directive from Trump on Thursday stopped short of imposing fresh tariffs, instead kicking off what could be weeks or months of investigation into the levies imposed on U.S. goods by other trading partners and then devising a response.\"While global financial markets may be inclined to take some relief from the delay in the immediate imposition of reciprocal tariffs, it is not clear to us whether the delay necessarily reflects a lower likelihood that they will eventually be imposed,\" Barclays analysts said in a note.Trump has kicked off a trade war, first by imposing tariffs on Mexico and Canada and then pausing them, but sticking with duties on Chinese goods.\"It seems that Trump's bark has once again proved worse than his bite when it comes to the matter of trade,\" said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone.\"That doesn't, however, stop this now rather tiresome merry-go-round of headlines, nor the accompanying yo-yo price action, as participants grapple with whatever the latest story is, and try to discount it.\"European stocks were mixed, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index <.STOXX> up 0.1% on the day, having closed at a record high on Thursday. Futures for Nasdaq and S&P 500 were a touch higher.European markets have outperformed in recent months due to hopes for a possible peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the prospect of interest rate cuts and U.S. tariffs being less severe than feared. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price forecast for Europe's STOXX 600, citing the possibility of a Ukraine ceasefire.In Asia, the spotlight has been on a rally in Chinese tech stocks, with the Hang Seng Tech Index hitting its highest level in three years on Thursday spurred by home-grown start-up DeepSeek's breakthrough. [.HK]On Friday, Hong Kong's benchmark index rose over 2%, taking its weekly gains to 5%, its fifth straight week of gains and the strongest weekly performance in four months.James Ooi, market strategist at Tiger Brokers, said the DeepSeek-driven rally appears to have further upside in the short term, but a sustained rally will depend on the Chinese tech sector's ability to monetise AI.\"While Chinese tech companies trade at lower valuations, their reliance on domestic revenue limits their potential to reach valuation levels comparable to global tech giants ... they (also) face heightened scrutiny over privacy and security concerns,\" Ooi said.INFLATION WATCHData on Thursday showed U.S. producer prices rose solidly in January, bolstering financial market views that the Federal Reserve would not be cutting interest rates before the second half of the year.But components of the data that are part of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed's preferred inflation measure, were soft and added to hopes the PCE reading may be cooler than currently expected.The data comes on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index (CPI), which showed its largest acceleration in nearly 1-1/2 years.The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes was steady at 4.5347% after tumbling 10 basis points on Thursday, clocking its biggest daily drop in a month. [US/]The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.2% on the day at 106.93 after dropping 0.8% on Thursday, its biggest one-day percentage drop since January 20.The euro hovered near its highest in more than two weeks at $1.0477, supported by optimism around potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. [FRX/]Oil prices rose, poised to end three weeks of losses, buoyed partly by rising fuel demand.Brent futures were up 0.5% at $75.37 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.4% to $71.45.

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. I have a 401(k) with $120,000 in it. Im 74 and getting the required minimum distribution at the end of each year. Do I need a retirement planner to help handle the withdrawal?   Susan While technically you dont need a financial advisor to handle your retirement account withdrawals, it can be useful to talk with one. Between deciding which investments to liquidate, navigating potential tax implications and making sure you withdraw the right amount to satisfy your required minimum distribution (RMD), having a professional in your corner can help you make the most of your retirement money.Do you have retirement planning questions? Speak with a financial advisor today.Required minimum distributions (RMDs) are the absolute minimum withdrawals that the U.S. tax code requires you to take from pre-tax retirement accounts. These distributions must be taken from most types of accounts, including:Traditional IRAs401(k) plans403(b) plans457(b) plansSEP IRAsSIMPLE IRAsRollover IRAsSince you havent paid any tax on this income yet, the IRS wants to make sure that you do. Thats why they force you to take distributions once you turn age 73, regardless of whether or not you need the money.There are strict rules in place about the timing and amount of these distributions, with big penalties for getting it wrong. The IRS charges a hefty 25% of the amount not taken in time, and that can put a big dent in your savings.RMD calculations are based on the amount of money thats in your pre-tax retirement accounts and your expected longevity.Start with the year-end balance from your retirement account from last year. Then look up the RMD factor factor that corresponds with your age from the appropriate IRS Life Expectancy Table.For example, imagine a retiree named Cameron with $150,000 in an IRA on Dec. 31, 2022. Since Cameron is 74 years old in 2023 and his situation fits the Uniform Lifetime Table (the table that most people use to calculate their RMDs), his RMD factor would be 25.5. To figure out his RMD, he then divides his balance of $150,000 by a factor of 25.5. That calculates to an RMD of $5,882.35 for 2023.You dont have to take the RMD all at once  you can break it up into a series of payments throughout the year if thats easier for you. You can also take more than your RMD if you need to. This is just the minimum withdrawal youre required to take. (And if you want to talk through your RMD calculations with a professional, speak with a financial advisor.)Many people have multiple retirement accounts, and that affects their RMD calculations. Technically, you have to calculate separate RMDs for each of your retirement accounts. But you can take one big summed-up RMD from any of the accounts if thats easier for you. For example, if you have five IRAs, each with a $2,000 RMD, you can withdraw $10,000 from just one of those accounts or any other combination, as long as you hit the $10,000 total.These aggregation rules have an exception: If you have more than one 401(k), you have to take separate RMDs from each one.Theres another special rule for workplace plans. If youre still working and dont own more than 5% of the company you work for, you dont have to take RMDs from that companys plan until you stop working there.Meanwhile, if youre married, you and your spouse each must take your RMDs from your own separate accounts, even if you file a joint tax return.Taking an RMD is not quite as simple as taking money out of a savings account. Since most peoples retirement accounts are invested, youll probably have to sell off, or liquidate, investments to convert them into cash. Thats where working with an advisor can come in handy. (And if you need help finding an advisor, consider using SmartAssets free advisor matching tool.)RMDs increase your taxable income, so they also increase your tax bill. That can lead to a nasty balance thats due when you file your annual income tax returns if you havent made any federal or state tax payments.In addition, RMDs increase your adjusted gross income (AGI), a tax number used to determine other aspects of your taxable income. For example, AGI affects your ability to take advantage of certain tax credits or deductions. In most cases, RMDs will increase your tax bill. In order to avoid IRS penalties, you may need to either make estimated tax payments or have taxes withheld from your distributions.Reducing the amount you need to take in RMDs will lower your AGI, your taxable income and your overall tax bill. (And talking with a financial advisor can help you finalize any questions you may have.)Figuring out the correct RMD from each retirement account is just your starting point. From there, youll have a few things to consider, including:Which retirement account to take the RMDs fromWhich securities should be liquidated to make the withdrawalsWhether you should make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) to avoid taxation on your RMDHow much money you need to withdraw from your retirement accounts to live the way you want toWhether it makes sense to automate your retirement account withdrawalsHow much tax (if any) should be withheld from your distributionsWhether your beneficiary designations are set up properlyThats a lot to navigate alone, which is why it often makes sense to work with a financial advisor. They can help you make sure youre getting the most out of your retirement savings and not lose more than necessary to taxes. (And if you need help finding a financial advisor, consider finding one with SmartAssets tool.)Calculating your RMDs is relatively easy, but theres a lot more that goes into effectively managing these mandated withdrawals, including which investments to sell and the tax impact of these transactions. While you might not need a financial advisor to do all of this for you, its a good idea to at least talk with one before you start taking distributions.Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard. SmartAssets free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If youre ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.A lot goes into hiring a financial advisor. Youll want to consider the services they offer, how much they cost and their credentials, to name a few. Thats why we compiled a comprehensive guide for finding and choosing a financial advisor.Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

On Day 4 and later, you start looking for the index to rise sharply in higher volume than the previous session.When that triggers, it's called a follow-through day.The follow-through gives investors the green light to start buying leading stocks breaking out past correct buy points. Sync your trading to the stock market direction by gradually committing capital to leading stocks.But remember that while no market uptrend has ever begun without one, not every follow-through succeeds. So be ready to sell stocks that don't quickly start producing gains.Market tops occur over a number of weeks, as institutional investors shift from buying mode into selling mode. The most effective way to track institutional selling is with distribution days.A distribution day is when the Nasdaq composite or S&P 500 closes down 0.2% or more in volume heavier than the prior day. (Volume does not have to be above average, just higher than the prior day.)Of course, one day of selling doesn't necessarily mean that much. But if you start to see a series of distribution days within several weeks, that is cause for concern. It's an indication that mutual fund managers and other institutional investors are starting to sell more aggressively.Moving averages are another tool to help understand market direction. Indexes should remain above the 50-day average in an uptrend. A break of the line should be considered a warning sign.An index move above the 50-day line is a positive sign. Watch for support and resistance at the 50-day line, too. The 200-day line also can be helpful in the longer term.When a stock market uptrend starts to struggle, IBD's market outlook will shift to \"uptrend under pressure.\" It's time to play more defense than offense. Investors should be careful about buying stocks. If you do decide to buy stocks, focus only on growth stocks showing exceptional fundamental and technical strength.If institutional selling persists, IBD will downgrade its outlook to \"market in correction.\" That means all new buys are off the table and be prepared to lock in gains on your existing positions.As a refinement of the market outlook, IBD also provides a five-stage suggested exposure level. In the weakest circumstances, the recommended exposure is 0% to 20%. In bullish conditions, the highest exposure level is 80% to 100%.You can spot these shifts as they happen by regularly checking The Big Picture and Market Pulse.IBD subscribers receive a close reading on market behavior each day after the market closes in this column.

        "content": "Crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe are popular tools for raising money. But whether youre on the giving or receiving end of these fundraisers, its important to understand the tax consequences of a campaign.The good news is, if youre the beneficiary of a GoFundMe campaign, you typically wont owe taxes on the money you receive, provided that you follow certain IRS rules. The bad news: If you donate to a campaign, you probably wont qualify for a tax deduction.Read on to learn how GoFundMe taxes work, whether youre receiving money or donating to a campaign.To understand whether your GuFundMe contribution is tax deductible, first, you need to understand how charitable deductions work. If you itemize your tax return using Schedule A, you may be able to deduct certain charitable contributions. A tax deduction lowers your taxable income, meaning youll ultimately owe less to the Internal Revenue Service.But for itemizing to make sense, all of your deductions  which can also include things like mortgage interest and unreimbursed medical bills  have to add up to more than the standard deduction, which is the amount any taxpayer can deduct regardless of their actual expenses.In the 2024 tax year (for which returns are due April 15, 2025), the standard deduction is $14,600 for single filers and $29,200 for married couples filing a joint return. These amounts increase to $15,000 and $30,000, respectively, for tax year 2025. Nearly 90% of taxpayers take the standard deduction instead of itemizing, which means they arent eligible to deduct charitable contributions.If you itemize, you can generally deduct charitable contributions of up to 60% of your adjusted gross income. But a 20%, 30%, or 50% limit may apply in some situations.Read more: Itemize or take the standard deduction  which is better?GoFundMe has two types of fundraising campaigns: personal and charity. Usually, only donations to charitable fundraisers are tax deductible.Many of the campaigns you see on crowdfunding platforms (Kickstarter is another popular one) and social media are personal fundraisers. For example, you may see a campaign to help someone facing large medical expenses or a loved ones funeral costs, or someone who needs to replace their belongings after their home was destroyed. Contributions to these fundraisers are usually considered personal gifts and arent guaranteed to be tax-deductible charitable donations. Donors to personal campaigns wont receive a tax receipt from GoFundMe.However, if you make a contribution to a certified charity fundraiser, GoFundMe guarantees your donation will be tax deductible in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. Youll automatically receive a tax receipt from GoFundMes registered charity partner, PayPal Giving Fund. You can also make tax-deductible donations through GoFundMe Causes, which allows you to contribute to tax-exempt organizations and verified fundraisers in support of specific themes like education, the environment, or animal rescue.PRO TIP: Check the fundraiser page if you donated to a GoFundMe campaign and arent sure whether the fundraiser was a personal or charitable campaign. For charity fundraisers, the name of the nonprofit organization or charitable organization will appear next to the organizers name.When gift taxes apply, theyre always paid by the donor, rather than the recipient. Though donations to personal GoFundMe campaigns are usually considered gifts, you probably dont have to worry about paying federal tax on those GoFundMe gifts.Thats because something called the annual gift exclusion applies. You can make gifts to an unlimited number of people up to the annual gift exclusion, which is $19,000 in 2025.But even if you give more than $19,000 to someones personal GoFundMe fundraiser in 2025, its unlikely that youll owe gift taxes. Youll simply have to let the IRS know by filing a gift tax return.To owe gift taxes, the personal gifts youve made over your life would need to add up to more than the lifetime exclusion amount, which is $13.99 million in 2025.If you organize a GoFundMe campaign to benefit someone else, the money you raise wont be taxable as long as you distribute the funds to the campaign beneficiary.Being the beneficiary of a GoFundMe campaign probably wont result in a tax bill either. Donations to a crowdfunding campaign thats meant to benefit an individual are usually treated as personal gifts and arent subject to income tax.However, there are a couple of situations where money raised through GoFundMe could be treated as taxable income. If donors received something of value for giving money  which is common when small businesses raise funds through crowdfunding  the money could be taxable. For example, if youre raising money for your small business and you reward contributors with a T-shirt or magnet, youll most likely need to report the proceeds as business income.Another situation when you could owe taxes on your GoFundMe campaign arises if your employer donates. Generally, any contributions your employer makes for your benefit need to be included in your gross income.If you receive more than $600 from a crowdfunding campaign, the platform may send you IRS Form 1099-K, which is used to report income from third-party payment apps and online marketplaces, as well as credit cards, debit cards, and gift cards. Getting Form 1099-K from GoFundMe or another crowdfunding site doesnt necessarily mean you owe taxes. But youll still need to report the income when you file your taxes.PRO TIP: The IRS recommends that both organizers and beneficiaries of crowdfunding campaigns maintain records about the campaign and disbursement of funds for at least three years.Read more: What is taxable income?If youre the beneficiary of a GoFundMe campaign, youll want to consult with a tax professional before filing your return. Its essential to be sure youre following all the rules so that you wont be hit with an unexpected tax bill. Youll also want to seek advice about what records and tax documents you should keep in case the IRS has questions about the campaign.Donors may also want to seek advice from a professional, like a CPA, in some cases. If youre taking the standard deduction and contributed $25 or $50 to a GoFundMe campaign, using tax filing software may be sufficient because your donation wouldnt affect your taxes. But if you made contributions to a GoFundMe that are substantial enough to have tax consequences, enlist the help of a professional. A tax preparer can analyze your tax situation and help you determine whether your contributions are tax deductible and, if applicable, how to maximize the value of your deduction in your tax planning.Is GoFundMe a 501(c)3?GoFundMe is a for-profit company, not a 501(c)3 organization. However, it partners with and supports GoFundMe.org, which is an independent 501(c)3 organization, also known as a qualified charitable organization, that manages GoFundMe Causes fundraisers.Do people have to pay taxes on money raised from GoFundMe?Usually, when you receive money from a GoFundMe campaign for personal expenses, like a medical bill or funeral costs, its considered a gift and isnt taxable. But there are a few exceptions: If donors received something of value when they contributed or your employer donated, you could face tax liability.How much money can a person receive as a gift without being taxed?When gift taxes apply, theyre paid by the person making the gift, rather than the person receiving the gift. You can make gifts up to the annual exclusion amount ($18,000 in 2024 and $19,000 in 2025) to an unlimited number of people. If you make gifts above these thresholds, youll need to file a gift tax return. However, gift taxes only apply to those who give away millions of dollars in their lifetimes."

        "source": "Reuters",
        "content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The following are key quotes from a Reuters interview with Croatian central bank Governor and ECB policymaker Boris Vujcic.* Economic and inflation developments remain in line with the baseline we projected in December. Any deviation is small. So, I would say so far so good, but we are coming up on a critical period in that core inflation should start to slow quite substantially in the coming months. Wage pressures and services inflation both are projected to fall and that is expected to bring down core inflation. This slowdown needs to happen for me to say I remain comfortable with our projections. Many services are typically repriced at the start of the year and we anticipate a significantly lower increase than last year.* The market is pricing three more rate cuts this year. Given information we have today and the fact that inflation is developing along our projections, those expectations are not unreasonable. But as I said, we are just coming up on a critical period. For those rate cuts to materialise, we need to see a slowdown in core inflation and a slowdown in services inflation. The next three months will, thus, be very informative in terms of the economic data.* The exchange rate is one factor we consider but, at the current level, its not something we need to worry about. A potentially bigger issue is that the pass-through effect may have changed. Our models on exchange rate pass-through are typically based on series of data which date back to a very low inflation environment. But we know that the pass-through is state dependent and will be different when inflation is low and when its high. So, you can expect that pass-through is higher now than it was over the past twenty years.* Divergence with the Fed is not a financial stability risk at the moment. When monetary conditions diverge you have an exchange rate effect. But there is also a second impact via the bond market. When long-end yields rise in the U.S., investors will arbitrage that, which then tightens monetary conditions in Europe, too. The exchange rate impact and the yield rise work in opposite directions and they offset each other to some extent, if not fully. But, so far, we have not seen much of either exchange rate or bond market impact.* Uncertainty around tariffs is immense and uncertainty has a negative impact on investment decisions. When it comes to setting policy, you need to know the exact nature of the tariffs. Without that sort of detail, you cant estimate the impact. It's a different situation if you have, let's say, a blanket tariffs on everyone or if you have differentiated levels between countries, trading blocs or, and sectors. Retaliatory measures are equally, important. Specific structure of trade restrictions, be it tariffs or voluntary export restrictions or other non tariff barriers to trade determines an impact on output and inflation. The only reasonable option for monetary policy now is to wait to see what comes out of that uncertainty that we now face. But the sooner we have clarity, the better.* The neutral rate is a good theoretical concept because it helps you to think about the economy and the impact of monetary policy. But this concept is not something that drives policymaking. We are not in a world where we can claim with absolute certainty where neutral is and set a calendar for when we want to get there. Neutral is both uncertain and it changes with time.* The closer inflation gets to the target, in data and projections, the more intense the discussion gets about where to stop reducing rates. The same was true when we were raising interest rates. Early attempts, by some, to estimate the terminal rate proved far off the mark where we ended. And discussions intensified as we approached the peak. We are certainly getting close to the discussion on when we should remove restrictive from our language. It should happen when its no longer possible to say with full certainty that youre still in the restrictive zone. This could already happen at our next meeting, but it will also depend on the incoming data.* The closer we get to the target, the risks become more balanced. Balanced means there is a similar risk of overshooting and undershooting. We shouldnt make too much of a fuss about this because its normal. Its simply a consequence of the monetary policy, although not exclusively, outcomes.* The European economy has been more or less stagnant for over a year. Growth is indeed weak, but I dont see much of a risk for a recession. Then again, I also dont see any rapid recovery happening. Consumption is where our projections have been off. However, the prerequisites for a recovery in consumption are there. Real incomes have caught up, savings are higher than before the pandemic and employment is high and stable. Why is consumption not recovering then? It's probably related to downbeat sentiment, especially in some major economies. But that can change. As soon as you get a few months of more upbeat sentiment readings, consumption can accelerate because the conditions are in place.* The labour market is holding up better than was widely anticipated. My interpretation is that businesses are hoarding labour, partly because they learned during the pandemic that its expensive to fire and rehire workers. However, companies have become a lot more flexible with their workforce. Often, its not headcount they reduce but hours worked. We see manufacturing firms in Croatia going to a four-day week instead of cutting headcount due to weak demand. Services firms are cutting daily hours meanwhile. This type of flexibility doesnt show up in increased unemployment. And this is a good news. This sort of increased flexibility can hold up confidence because people will be less afraid of losing their jobs.* More labour market flexibility also addressed the productivity issue, at least in part. Yes, productivity per employee is stagnant. But productivity per hour worked has increased in relative terms compared to pre-pandemic times.(Reporting by Balazs Koranyi)"

Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.This embedded content is not available in your region.Yahoo Finance has a free mortgage payment calculator to help you see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.Our calculator goes even deeper by including factors like homeowners insurance and property taxes in your calculation. You can even add private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.A mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will stay at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)An adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Lets say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and U.S. housing market.At the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.Dig deeper: Adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage  Which should you choose?Two categories determine mortgage rates: ones you can control and ones you cannot control.What factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.Second, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.What factors can you not control? In short, the economy.The list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy  think employment rates, for example  is struggling, mortgage rates go down to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.With all other things being equal, mortgage refinance rates are usually a little higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.Two of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.A 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because youre accumulating interest for three decades, youll pay a lot of interest in the long run.A 15-year mortgage can be great because it has a lower rate than youll get with longer terms, so youll pay less in interest over the years. Youll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because youre paying off the same loan amount in half the time.Basically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.According to 2023 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Citibank, Wells Fargo, and USAA. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate with not just banks, but also credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.Yes, 2.75% is a fantastic mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.According to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip this low again anytime soon.Some experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on what your financial goals are when refinancing and when your break-even point would be after paying refinance closing costs."

        "content": "New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose more than forecast in January as core prices reversed last month's easing with the Federal Reserve's path forward in focus.The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 3.0% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices.The index rose 0.5% over the previous month, the largest monthly headline increase since August 2023 and a slight acceleration from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Economists had expected a 0.3% increase.Seasonal factors like higher fuel costs and continued stickiness in food inflation kept the headline figures elevated. Notably, the index for eggs increased 15.2%, the largest increase since June 2015. It accounted for about two thirds of the total monthly food at home increase, according to the BLS.On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January climbed 0.4% over the prior month, higher than December's 0.2% monthly gain and the largest monthly rise since April 2023.Core prices rose 3.3% over last year, marking an uptick from the 3.2% seen in December, which was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI showed a deceleration in price growth.Core inflation has remained stubbornly elevated due to sticky costs for shelter and services like insurance and medical care. Shelter did show some signs of easing last month, rising 4.4% on an annual basis, the smallest 12-month increase in three years.It was a different story for used car prices, which saw another strong uptick for the fourth consecutive month. The index rose 2.2% in January after a 1.2% increase in December and a 2% monthly gain in November.Although inflation has been slowing, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis with economists and Fed officials pointing to a \"bumpy\" road ahead.\"There's no sugarcoating this. This is not a good print,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Federal Reserve economist, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program.\"The one thing to say is this is a familiar disappointment,\" she continued, noting the start of a new year has previously contributed to upside surprises. \"Having a hot print in January in recent years has been a common occurrence. It's also been a common occurrence that's dissipated as the year has gone on. So this isn't a deal breaker for the year as a whole, but it is certainly not a good way to start things off.\"Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, agreed, adding \"seasonality and one-off factors may have played some role in the upside surprise.\"However, \"the combination of average earnings growth surprising to the upside last week, the supercore services inflation number moving sharply higher today, and the governments policy agenda threatening to raise inflation expectations, is almost too convincing to dismiss,\" she said.The ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency has further muddied the inflation outlook, with economists arguing the US could face another inflation resurgence as Trump commits to a protectionist trade policy. That's likely to complicate the central bank's path forward for interest rates.On Monday, President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.Shortly after the release, traders scaled back expectations of a Fed rate cut, pricing in just one cut from the central bank this year. Stocks also sold off on the news.\"The Fed is never going to overreact to one month of data,\" Sahm said. \"They've been telling us since December that they are in no hurry to adjust rates again and that will be reinforced today.\"\"We're back in the case of last year where we're going to have to see months and months  getting out of the first quarter  of better inflation data before the Fed gets comfortable with it. So it really does push the timeline probably into the second half of the year [if] this ends up being the outlier.\"Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The problem, he says, is that his competitors have the same idea.\"It will only result in a mad rat race,\" said Fang, expecting his firm will have to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins. \"The cake is only that big. We all want to grab a piece so the competition will get intense.\"The trade war between Washington and Beijing, which escalated this month with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods as an \"opening salvo,\" could deal a new supply shock to the rest of the world.Chinese producers, facing weak demand at home and harsher conditions in the United States, where they sell more than $400 billion worth of goods annually, have no choice but to rush to alternative export markets all at the same time.But no other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world could absorb from its second-largest economy.This will intensify price wars among Chinese exporters, squeezing their profitability, while also risking further political backlash in the new markets and fanning deflationary forces, if smaller margins result in job losses, wage cuts and reduced investment.Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC, says market diversification is an understandable but unsustainable strategy.\"One risk is that suddenly every Chinese exporter will look to develop the same other markets,\" said Neumann, adding it would weigh on profits.\"But the real risk is that the receiving countries might ultimately then be forced to raise restrictive measures on China, because their own producers are coming under pressure.\"Tensions are already high. Over the past year, the European Union has increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles while India, Indonesia and other emerging markets have raised their own trade barriers on certain Chinese products.China is a formidable competitor in some sectors. Major electric vehicle makers such as BYD or DeepSeek's AI platform have already made a mark on the global stage.\"We have very strong supply chain systems,\" said Dave Fong, who manufactures school bags, talking teddy bears, stationery and consumer electronics in China and is investing 30-40% more on advertising and business development in Europe and Asia.\"From one idea to mass production, everything is very fast.\"But smaller firms worry about survival.Richard Chen, who owns a Christmas decorations factory in southern China, says he operates on almost no profit margins and is unsure whether he can keep all of his 80 staff this year.\"We tried to go into Poland, but they simply don't buy things like customers in the U.S. do,\" said Chen. \"This is the worst things have ever been.\"RIPPLES AT HOMEThe price wars abroad risk accelerating deflationary forces at home.A manager at a bathtub factory in Shijiazhuang, some 300km (190 miles) south of Beijing, says he is trying to sell more in Brazil and Argentina to cushion the impact of the 35% tariffs he now faces in the U.S. after the latest hike.He said American retailers pressure him to cut prices by 10%, but he hesitates, having already slashed wages by 10-15% to stay competitive.\"There are many Chinese foreign traders in the same industry. For everyone it's so difficult,\" said the manager, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic.Li Yongqi, manager at Jialifu Electric Vehicle Company, which makes electric scooters and tricycles, sells mostly domestically, but expects that wage cuts and job losses at other factories, and the ongoing property crisis in China, will shrink demand at home and shave 20%-30% of his profits.\"Chinese firms in every industry are going abroad and rushing into overseas markets, then foreign governments all place tariffs and sanctions,\" Li said. \"Most of these factories are laying off workers to reduce costs.\"The Politburo, the Communist Party's top decision-making body, called on industries last year to avoid destructive competition. Chinese solar panel producers have urged the government to intervene to curb overcapacity.Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis, said the only way out for China is to produce less.\"It will be very painful,\" she added. \"Nobody is going to take your products forever. So it's just a choice: if you want to create more welfare, more growth, then you need to consume more.\"Neumann at HSBC says policies that boost household consumption may benefit China internationally as well.\"Ultimately, to lower trade frictions with the rest of the world ... it's also about developing domestic demand to help absorb some of the production,\" Neumann said.(Reporting by Ellen Zhang and Laurie Chen in Beijing; James Pomfret in Hong Kong; David Kirton in Shenzhen; Graphics by Kripa Jayaram; Editing by Marius Zaharia and Sam Holmes)"

        "content": "Money market accounts (MMAs) can be a great place to store your cash if you're looking for a relatively high interest rate along with liquidity and flexibility.Unlike traditional savings accounts, MMAs typically offer better returns, and they may also provide check-writing privileges and debit card access. This makes these accounts ideal for holding long-term savings that you want to grow over time, but can still access when needed for certain purchases or bills.The national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.64%, according to the FDIC. However, the best money market account rates often pay above 4% APY  similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts.Here is a look at today's highest money market account rates:Interested in earning the best possible interest rate on your savings balance? Here is a look at some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.This embedded content is not available in your region.Money market account rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years, largely due to changes in the Federal Reserve's target interest rate, known as the federal funds rate.In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, for example, interest rates were kept extremely low to stimulate the economy. The Fed slashed the federal funds rate to near zero, which led to very low MMA rates. During this time, money market account rates were typically around 0.10% to 0.50%, with many accounts offering rates on the lower end of that range.Eventually, the Fed began raising interest rates gradually as the economy improved. This led to higher yields on savings products, including MMAs. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a brief but sharp recession, and the Fed once again cut its benchmark rate to near zero to combat the economic fallout. This resulted in a sharp decline in MMA rates.But starting in 2022, the Fed embarked on a series of aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation. This led to historically high deposit rates across the board. By late 2023, money market account rates had risen substantially, with many accounts offering 4.00% or higher.Throughout 2024, MMA interest rates remained elevated, and it was possible to find accounts that paid well above 5% APY.Today, rates remain high by historical standards, though they've begun a downward trajectory following the Fed's most recent rate cuts later in late 2024. Today, online banks and credit unions tend to offer the highest rates.When comparing money market accounts, it's important to look beyond just the interest rate. Other factors, such as minimum balance requirements, fees, and withdrawal limits, can impact the total value you get from the account.For example, it's common for money market accounts to require a large minimum balance in order to earn the highest advertised rate  as much as $5,000 or more in some cases. Other accounts may charge monthly maintenance fees that can eat into your interest earnings.However, there are several MMAs available that offer competitive rates without any balance requirements, fees, or other restrictions. That's why it's important to shop around and compare accounts before making a decision.Additionally, ensure that the account you choose is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per institution, per depositor. Most money market accounts are federally insured, but it's important to double-check in the rare case the financial insitution fails.Read more: Are money market accounts safe?Today, money market account rates are still quite high by historical standards. The best accounts provide over 4% APY, with the highest rate available today at 4.75% APY.The amount $10,000 will earn in a money market account depends on the annual percentage yield (APY) offered by the account, as well as how long you keep your money in the account. Let's say you choose to deposit $10,000 in a money market account that earns 4% APY with monthly compounding interest. After one year, you would earn $407.44 in interest, for a total balance of $10,407.44.Money market accounts are generally safe and flexible savings options, but like any other financial product, they come with some downsides, too.For instance, some MMAs require a high minimum balance to open the account or to earn the advertised APY. Failing to maintain that minimum balance can result in penalties or reduced interest rates. Additionally, money market rates are variable, which means they can change at any time at the bank's discretions. If interest rates drop, so will your account APY, which can make future earnings unpredictable compared to fixed-rate products like CDs.This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. Retiring early can be tricky, even if you have considerable home equity.Say for example that youre married with $1.4 million in your IRAs and a home worth $750,000. Retiring early could well be within reach, but you may face be a few big challenges. Retiring at age 60 means having to wait several years to become eligible for Social Security and Medicare, potentially leaving you overly dependent on portfolio income. Turning your home equity into cash, meanwhile, can pad your nest egg, but it may increase your housing costs going forward.If you need help assessing whether early retirement is within reach, try connecting with a financial advisor.While everyones situation is different, early retirement raises a few key challenges: the years-long delay before Social Security and Medicare kick in, as well as an early reliance on portfolio withdrawals.First, retiring before age 62 means you wont have immediate access to Social Security.While 62 is the minimum age to begin taking Social Security benefits, doing so means taking a 30% reduction in benefits for the rest of your life. However, you wont receive your full benefit unless you wait until full retirement age (67 for most). Waiting until age 70 to file for Social Security can increase your benefits by at least 24%, but it will mean relying on other income sources until you turn 70.By retiring at 60, for example, there would be at least a two-year gap before you could collect Social Security. If you already expect to be living on a tight budget in retirement, not having these benefits may put significant strain on your finances.Retiring early will also mean budgeting for health insurance.Medicare coverage begins at age 65, at which point you will receive significant (but not comprehensive) health insurance through the government. You may also want to budget for supplemental coverage such as gap and long-term care insurance. However, by retiring at age 60, you would also need to replace any health insurance you received through your employer.If you already pay for health insurance out of pocket, keep that line-item in your budget. If not, price out individual coverage plans and account for those premiums in your retirement budget.Finally, retiring early means that youll transition from the accumulation phase to the withdrawal phase sooner than other people. While your portfolio will continue to generate returns in retirement, most households withdraw money faster than their portfolios accrue it.If you retire at age 60 instead of 67, you would need to rely more heavily on your portfolio for seven more years. As with Social Security, make sure you have enough money to support a comfortable lifestyle for these extra years. If not, early retirement may not be wise. And if you help assistance evaluating how long your assets may last, a financial advisor can help.In a sense, retiring early is no different than at any other time. It all comes down to income vs. spending. If you have enough benefits and assets to cover your lifestyle for a foreseeable life span, you may be able afford to retire. If not, then something needs to change.In the hypothetical scenario from above, you and your spouse are 58 with $1.4 million in your IRA and a paid-off home thats worth $750,000. Could you afford to retire at 60?Assuming your IRA balances grow at, say 5% per year, over the next two years, you would end up with approximately $1.54 million. Using the 4% rule for withdrawals, you and your spouse could potentially afford to withdraw $61,600 from a balanced portfolio (50% stock, 50% bonds) in your first year of retirement and then adjust your withdrawals by the rate of inflation in subsequent years. While the 4% rule is a static approach that doesnt account for your changing spending needs, its designed to make a retirement portfolio last up to 30 years. However, since the money is in a pre-tax account, youll have to account for the taxes that youll owe on the withdrawals, as well.Whether your IRA and Social Security benefits (when they start) would be enough to support your lifestyle for the rest of your life depends not only on how long you will live, but how much you expect to spend.There are some ways to boost this income, but all have their own risks and benefits. For example, you could invest in a guaranteed lifetime annuity. A representative annuity purchased for $1.4 million might pay $8,041 per month or $96,492 per year. While an annuity may deliver more annual income than the 4% rule would  at least initially  annuities typically arent indexed for inflation. At standard rates the purchasing power of this income would be worth about half its original value in 30 years.On the other hand, say you and your spouse delay retirement. If your IRAs were to grow at 5% per year between ages 60 and 67, you could retire with more than $2.17 million. At that point, withdrawing 4% in your first year of retirement would produce approximately $86,800 before taxes. You also would have seven fewer years of retirement to fund. But if you need help building an income plan for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.Then theres the house. Many retirees anticipate their home being a significant, if not primary, source of wealth in retirement.In theory, selling your $750,000 home in two years and adding the proceeds to your retirement nest egg would bring your total assets to $2.29 million before taxes. Again, this assumes your IRAs grow at 5% per year over the next two years. Withdrawing 4% from that cumulative pot of money would produce an income of $91,600 in your first year of retirement.But home equity isnt a full-value financial asset, because you will still need somewhere to live. If you buy a new home, you can only invest whatevers left over. Taking a mortgage would cost even more because of interest, and leave you with a new monthly expense.Renting involves lower stakes but will increase your monthly budget indefinitely. Particularly if you live in an expensive city, you would trade the low costs of a paid-off home (insurance and taxes) for monthly rent that will likely increase with inflation.These are all things to think about as you consider tapping your home equity in retirement. But if you need an experts perspective, speak with a financial advisor.Retiring early is an ambitious, and spectacular goal. If you plan on retiring before 65, its important to account for moving pieces like Social Security, Medicare and the extra years of portfolio withdrawals ahead. Early retirement is possible, but make sure youve got enough reliable money on hand before making the leap.A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard. SmartAssets free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If youre ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.One option we did not discuss is the reverse mortgage, a financial product designed to let retirees get the value of their homes equity without having to sell the property. These loans can be valuable and risky, and its worth thinking carefully about whether a reverse mortgage is right for you.Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

        "content": "By Ethan Wang and Kevin YaoBEIJING (Reuters) -New bank loans in China surged more than expected to a record high in January as the central bank moved to shore up a patchy economic recovery, reinforcing expectations for more stimulus in coming months as U.S. tariffs threaten to pile more pressure on the economy.Chinese banks extended 5.13 trillion yuan ($706.40 billion) in new yuan loans in January, more than quadrupling the December figure, data from the People's Bank of China showed on Friday, beating analysts' forecastsAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 4.5 trillion yuan last month, up sharply from 990 billion yuan in December and compared with 4.92 trillion yuan a year earlier - the previous record.Chinese banks usually rush to lend at the beginning of the year as they compete for higher-quality customers and win market share, but analysts cautioned that lingering economic uncertainty continues to weigh on credit demand.\"While the headline figures for new local currency loans hit a record high in January, that's only due to the usual season pattern. Net lending is always the strongest in the start of the year,\" Capital Economics said in a note.\"Bank loan growth continued to slide to record lows, but this was offset by a pick-up in non-bank credit growth. Robust government bond issuance should continue supporting credit growth in the coming quarters, but weak private demand will likely keep credit growth subdued.\"Household loans, including mortgages, rose to 443.8 billion yuan in January from 350 billion yuan in December, while corporate loans jumped to 4.78 trillion yuan from 490 billion yuan, central bank data showed.New bank lending totalled 18.09 trillion yuan last year, down from a record 22.75 trillion yuan in 2023 and hitting the lowest level since 2019, as businesses and consumers remained cautious about taking on more debt amid an uncertain economic outlook.The economy grew 5% in 2024, meeting the government's official target, but the post-pandemic recovery has been patchy, with exports and manufacturing making up for weak domestic consumption.Beijing is expected to maintain a growth target of around 5% this year, but analysts are uncertain over how quickly policymakers can revive sluggish domestic demand, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's punitive trade measures put more pressure on Chinese exporters.To sustain growth and counter rising external pressures, Beijing has pledged higher fiscal spending, increased debt issuance and further monetary easing.The central bank said on Thursday it would adjust its monetary policy at the appropriate time and use policy tools such as interest rates and bank reserve requirement ratios (RRR) to support the economy, amid rising external headwinds.China is facing a renewed trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump slapped sweeping 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports.In response, Beijing announced tariffs up to 15% on some U.S. imports starting February 10.Still, the measures so far have been more modest than markets had feared, raising hopes there was room for negotiating.Since September, Beijing has stepped up efforts to get the economy back on track, including interest rate cuts, a 10 trillion yuan debt relief package for local government, and tax incentives to spur demand in the crisis-hit property market.FURTHER POLICY EASING EXPECTEDWhile the central bank has been firmly supporting the yuan currency in the face of Trump's threats, analysts expect it will deliver further cuts in interest rates and RRR as early as the first quarter.Investors are looking to the annual parliament meeting in March, when the government is expected to unveil fresh stimulus measures, alongside economic targets.Reflecting credit demand concerns, outstanding yuan loans rose 7.5% in January from a year earlier - the lowest on record - down from 7.6% pace in December. Analysts had expected 7.3% growth.Broad M2 money supply grew 7.0% from a year earlier, the central bank data showed, below analysts' 7.2% forecast in a Reuters poll. In December, M2 expanded 7.3%.The narrower M1 money supply climbed 0.4% in January from a year earlier, compared with a 1.4% fall in December.Starting from January, the central bank included personal demand deposits and non-bank payment institutions' client provisions in M1, which previously covered only cash in circulation and corporate demand deposits.Annual growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, came in at 8.0% in January, unchanged from December.Acceleration in government bond issuance to boost the economy could help boost growth in TSF.TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies, and bond sales.TSF surged to 7.06 trillion yuan in January from 2.86 trillion yuan in December .

After the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose more than forecast in January, traders reduced their prediction of 2025 rate cuts down to just one  and not until much later in the year.\"It really does push the timeline into the second half of the year if things go well,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Fed economist, told Yahoo Finance.Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investmentsOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January climbed 0.4% over the prior month  higher than December's 0.2% monthly gain and the largest monthly rise since April 2023.Core CPI prices also rose 3.3% over last year, marking an uptick from the 3.2% seen in December, which was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI showed a deceleration in price growth.Fed officials were already predicting a cautious stance in 2025 before today's reading.In December they predicted two cuts for all of 2025, downgrading a previous estimate of four, due to the uncertain path of inflation and concerns about the effect of economic policies from the new Trump administration.Powell reinforced that view in appearances before Senate and House lawmakers Tuesday and Wednesday, saying the Fed can hold rates steady for longer if the economy remains strong and inflation does not continue to move sustainably toward a target of 2%.\"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" Powell said.But the higher inflation reading may heighten pressure on Powell as he navigates the trade policies from the Trump administration that some economists predict will push inflation higher and political calls for rates to go lower from both sides of the aisle.In a social media post on Wednesday, President Donald Trump called for the rates to go lower, although he didn't specify whether he was talking about the Fed's short-term rates or longer-term borrowing costs.\"Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!\" he posted.In a separate post, he also said, \"Biden inflation up!\"Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, told Powell Tuesday that she wanted to see rates reduced at the Fed's next meeting in March.\"I urge you to move more rapidly to bring down interest rates, beginning with a meaningful rate cut next month,\" Warren told Powell.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration is looking to lower long-term borrowing costs via the 10-year Treasury yield and not by targeting the Fed's short-term benchmark interest rate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury moved higher Wednesday on the hotter inflation report.Powell repeatedly on Wednesday declined to speculate on what Trump's trade policies might mean for inflation, arguing that policymakers need to see what is actually implemented and then assess the impact.While it's \"possible that the economy would evolve in ways partly because of tariffs that we will need to do something with our policy rate,\" the Fed is \"reserving judgment until we know what the policies are.\"Sahm, the former Fed economist, told Yahoo Finance the central bank is now back to where it was at the start of 2024, needing several months of good data before it can think about lowering rates again.\"It is not a good way to start things off\" in 2025, she added.Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth even said he thinks predictions of one cut in 2025 are \"too dovish.\"\"With tariffs likely to keep core PCE inflation close to, or above, 3% this year now, the Fed will stand pat for at least the next 12 months.\"Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock pricesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Newly adjusted figures reveal the average total household debt stands at approximately $147,919 nationwide. However, debt levels vary significantly across the United States, with notable disparities at both the geographical and generational level. These differences can highlight how certain areas grapple with higher debts, while others may have higher flows of disposable income. Additionally, the age of residents in different areas could affect their sources of financial stress and flexibility.With this in mind, SmartAsset adjusted the latest debt breakdowns by region and age group to December 2024 dollars to understand the financial bottlenecks different American cohorts are facing. It also ranked states based on the percentage of households that have a negative net worth after accounting for all their assets and debts.The West leads in total debt. Households in the West hold the highest average of total debt, just over $104,200. The Midwest follows with households owing $71,247 on average. Midwestern households also have the largest average business debt at $38,601.Home debt is a primary driver of regional variations. Households in the West report average home debt of $263,723 - substantially above other regions, where home-related debt ranges from $127,000 to $160,000.Millennials hold the most student loan debt. With an adjusted average of $27,648 in student loans, this age group has the highest student loan debt per person.Gen X carries the highest total debt. Those in their mid-40s through 50s hold the largest overall debt burden, averaging nearly $107,000. Meanwhile, Baby Boomers average less than half that at an average of $49,448.On average, 11.1% of households across the U.S. have a zero or negative net worth. On the opposite end of the spectrum, an average of 30.3% of U.S. households have a net worth between $100k and $499,999, with another 29.2% having a net worth of $500k or more.Wyoming has the highest percentage of households with zero or negative net worth (20%). The Cowboy State also has a relatively high percentage of households with $500K+ in net worth (26.4%). This suggests a strong disparity in wealth.These two states have the highest rates of households with low net worth.

Many 60-year-olds with $960,000 in tax-deferred retirement accounts and a work history that will entitle them to $2,400 monthly from Social Security could probably retire in two years. However, much depends on circumstances. Individual lifestyle preferences, including local cost of living and plans for travel or other potentially costly recreational activities, could mean that delaying retirement for a period would make sense. Other factors to consider include your personal debt load, particularly whether you have an existing mortgage, and the outlook for your personal healthcare costs and overall longevity. Even a seemingly well-funded retirement could fall short if things turn out the wrong way.A financial advisor can help project your income and expenses in retirement to aid your decision about when to retire. Use this free tool to match with vetted fiduciary financial advisors.Deciding whether or not you can retire involves balancing your expected income in retirement against your expected expenses. If it appears you will likely have enough funds to pay your costs of living, with a cushion for contingencies, retirement may be feasible. Let's start with the income aspect.The $960,000 combined balances of your IRA and 401(k) accounts could grow to $1,099,104 over the next two years if you assume a 7% average annual return. A more conservative investment strategy emphasizing capital preservation over growth might be more appropriate for someone near retirement. This could average 5% annual growth, potentially giving you $1,058,400 in two years.The 4% guideline suggests you can safely withdraw 4% of your retirement account balance each year, increasing the amount annually by the rate of inflation. Using this rule of thumb, someone with $1,058,400 would withdraw 4% times $1,058,400, or $42,336, the first year of retirement. Assuming 2% inflation, in the second year they would withdraw 102% of that amount, or $43,183, and so on. Financial modeling using a wide range of possible financial scenarios indicates a high likelihood that this strategy will enable a nest egg to last at least 30 years.Now let's turn to Social Security. These benefits are valuable sources of retirement income because they are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States and include annual cost-of-living adjustments to counter the effects of inflation. Social Security pays you as long as you are alive and can continue paying your spouse and any dependents after you are gone.You can claim Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. Your $2,400 monthly benefit equals $28,800 annually. You could increase this by delaying claiming Social Security benefits. For each year you wait, the monthly amount grows 8%. If you wait five years, until full retirement age at 67, your benefit would be approximately $42,317. Delay another three years to age 70 and the benefit goes to approximately $53,306.Assuming you claim Social Security at 62 and receive $28,800 annually, with $42,336 in investment income total first-year income comes to $71,136. This will increase annually more or less in step with inflation. Now let's look at expenses.Remember, this example uses many simplified assumptions. A financial advisor can help you do the math for your retirement strategy.One way to estimate retirement expenses is to use a guideline of 75% of your pre-retirement income. Data on average earnings by age indicates you will earn about $65,936 the year before your planned retirement age. According to this guideline, $65,936 times 75% or $49,452 is likely to be adequate to support your retirement lifestyle.Actual figures for average retiree spending vary, but are generally lower. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 2023 expenditures for households headed by someone 65 or older were $60,087 on average. The Social Security Administration, meanwhile, reported 2020 expenditures for households headed by someone 65 or older averaged $45,270.A more customized way to project your retirement expenses is to take your current expenses and modify them to reflect changes after you stop working. For instance, you won't have expenses for retirement savings, work clothes or commuting costs. Adding up your current expenses may help you spot ways to reduce costs if necessary. For most people housing is their biggest expense in retirement, so moving to a lower-cost location can be an effective way to bring your spending in line with your income.Taxes can be a significant concern in retirement. Retirement account withdrawals are taxable, and after age 75 (assuming you are 60 now) you'll have to start taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from your accounts. In your case, you are likely to be already withdrawing more than the RMD amounts, so this will probably not be an issue. Generally speaking, most people pay fewer taxes in retirement. However, at your income level up to 85% of your Social Security benefits will also be taxable.If you have existing debt, such as a mortgage payment or student loans, loan payments may need to be considered in your budget. Healthcare costs tend to go up in retirement, and this can be especially consequential if you have health conditions requiring expensive treatment. Overall, however, your expected retirement income of $71,136 is likely to be comfortably more than your living expenses, assuming they fall into the typical range $45,207 to $60,087.The choices you make can make a big difference in your bottom line. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for help with your own retirement planning.Your financial resources suggest you may be able to retire at age 62 without having to compromise your lifestyle much if at all. However, you can increase your retirement income significantly by waiting to claim Social Security benefits. That could help you cover your expenses if you expect to spend more in retirement than the typical retiree. You could also lower expenses by relocating or downsizing, if necessary. Be sure to consider factors that may be unique to your situation, such as significant debt payments or prospects for high healthcare costs.Asset allocation is a key element in your investment strategy with a potentially powerful effect on both risk and reward. Use SmartAsset's Asset Allocation Calculator to help you tailor your approach to your particular needs.Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

An emergency fund should be liquid  in an account that isnt at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

        "content": "A retracement in investing refers to a temporary reversal in the direction of an asset's price that occurs within a larger trend. It represents a short-term dip or pullback before the asset resumes its previous trajectory. Traders use retracements to identify potential entry points, often relying on technical analysis tools like Fibonacci retracement levels to gauge possible support or resistance areas. While retracements can resemble trend reversals, they are typically shorter in duration and do not indicate a fundamental change in market direction.Looking for someone to provide expert analysis on your portfolio? Speak with a financial advisor to see how they can help you evaluate and manage your investments.Retracement refers to a short-lived price movement against the prevailing trend within a financial market. It occurs when an asset experiences a short-term decline during an uptrend or a brief rally in a downtrend. Unlike reversals, which signal a potential change in trend direction, retracements are typically brief.Technical traders monitor retracements to distinguish normal market fluctuations from significant shifts in momentum. These temporary pullbacks can be caused by profit-taking, minor shifts in investor sentiment or short-term market corrections. While retracements are common across all asset classes, they are particularly notable in stocks, commodities and forex markets, where price movements are more volatile.Identifying retracements can help traders refine their strategies by recognizing areas where prices might stabilize before continuing their trend. SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to identify potential levels of support and resistance during a price pullback. It is based on the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical pattern where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Traders apply Fibonacci retracement levels to measure how much an asset's price has retraced before continuing its trend.The commonly used Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 78.6%. These levels are drawn between a high and low point on a price chart, creating horizontal lines that indicate where a retracement might find temporary support or resistance.The 38.2% and 61.8% levels are considered particularly significant, as prices often react around these areas. If an asset bounces off a Fibonacci level with strong volume, traders may see it as confirmation that the retracement is complete.Fibonacci retracement is most effective when combined with other indicators. These combinations can improve accuracy and avoid false signals.Moving averages, for instance, also play a role in assessing retracements. Short-term pullbacks often find support or resistance near the 50-day or 200-day moving average. If an asset's price rebounds after touching one of these levels, traders may interpret it as confirmation of a retracement rather than a trend reversal.Other technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), provide additional context by measuring momentum and overbought or oversold conditions.A retracement that coincides with a neutral or strengthening trend signal can reinforce a trader's confidence in a market's direction. By combining multiple indicators, analysts refine their strategies and improve their ability to distinguish between routine pullbacks and deeper market corrections.Retracement and reversal both involve price movements against an existing trend, but they differ in duration and implications. A retracement is a short-lived pullback that occurs within a prevailing trend, whereas a reversal signals a more significant shift, potentially leading to a long-term change in direction.Retracements are typically caused by profit-taking or minor shifts in market sentiment. Reversals often stem from fundamental changes, such as economic data releases, shifts in monetary policy or major geopolitical events.One key distinction is that retracements tend to respect established support and resistance levels. Reversals may break through these barriers, indicating a shift in market structure. Traders confirm reversals by looking for patterns such as head and shoulders formations, trendline breaks or declining volume on rebounds. In contrast, retracements often occur with stable or increasing volume, suggesting the trend remains intact.Understanding the difference between retracements and reversals helps traders avoid premature exits or entries. Misinterpreting a retracement as a reversal could lead to unnecessary trades, while failing to recognize a true reversal might result in holding a position longer than necessary.Recognizing retracements helps traders interpret market fluctuations without overreacting to short-term price movements. By analyzing technical indicators like Fibonacci retracement levels, moving averages and momentum signals, traders can better assess whether a price dip is temporary or a sign of a deeper shift. Differentiating retracements from reversals allows for more informed decision-making, reducing the likelihood of mistimed trades. While no tool guarantees accuracy, combining multiple signals provides a clearer picture of market trends.A thorough analysis starts with reviewing a company's income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement to assess profitability, debt levels, and cash generation. Key metrics like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, return on equity (ROE) and free cash flow (FCF) provide insight into valuation and financial health. Comparing these figures to industry peers helps gauge relative performance.If you dont have the time, energy or expertise to conduct your own investment analysis, consider hiring a financial advisor to do the heavy lifting for you.

        "content": "I have two inherited Roth accounts that total around $80,000, and an inherited IRA account with around $80,000 from my partners 401(k) account. My partner sadly passed away this year at age 45. I am 70 years old. What are my RMD requirements for this year and the next few years? JoseFirst of all, I am sorry for your loss. Hopefully I can answer your questions as completely as possible to help ease your mind. And your questions are entirely valid, as understanding the rules around required minimum distributions (RMDs) can be confusing on their own, and even more so when accounts are inherited.If you need help finding professional financial advice, match with a fiduciary financial advisor today.While I unfortunately will not be able to share exact amounts of your upcoming and future RMDs, I will try to provide some examples that can help you calculate them on your own, or with the help of either a certified public accountant or financial advisor. SmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. The RMD rules for inherited IRAs differ based on the type of account and the relationship between the beneficiary and the original account holder. For married couples, the rules often provide more flexibility, while non-married partners face stricter requirements.For traditional IRAs, spouses can choose to treat the account as their own or as an inherited IRA. Treating the account as their own means the surviving spouse transfers the account into their name or rolls it into their own IRA. In either case, RMDs will begin on the surviving spouses timeline and be calculated using the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table, which determines distributions based on the beneficiarys life expectancy.If you inherit the account as a spouse and choose to treat the account as your own, then you will not be subject to RMDs until you turn 73 in a few years. When the time comes to begin taking RMDs, you would look up your age on the Uniform Lifetime Table and divide the account balance by the relevant life expectancy factor (currently, the 73-year-old factor is 26.5). If the inherited accounts balance is $80,000, then your RMD for the first year  assuming life expectancy factors do not change  would be approximately $3,019 ($80,000  26.5). This approach allows the surviving spouse to delay RMDs until they reach the applicable age.Although it doesnt apply to your circumstances, if your surviving spouse was already subject to RMDs from their own accounts, then the inherited IRA would follow the same RMD schedule as their existing accounts.Alternatively, if the account is maintained as an inherited IRA, RMDs must begin by December 31 of the year after the original account holders death (2025 in this case) regardless of the surviving spouses age and are calculated using the Single Life Expectancy Table. Right now, the 70-year-old life expectancy factor is 17.2. Using the same $80,000 balance, your RMD for the first year would be approximately $4,651 ($80,000  17.2). This option generally results in larger annual distributions compared to treating the account as their own.Non-married partners inheriting a traditional IRA are subject to the SECURE Acts 10-year rule. This rule requires the entire account balance to be distributed within 10 years of the original account holders death. If the account holder had not started RMDs  as is the case here  then the non-married beneficiary is not required to take annual distributions but must withdraw the full balance by the end of the 10th year.For example, with an $80,000 inherited account, you might choose to withdraw equal amounts of $8,000 per year for 10 years or plan for larger distributions in specific years based on your tax situation and income needs.(Whether you inherit an IRA from your spouse or someone else, consider matching with a financial advisor who can help integrate the inheritance into a holistic financial plan.)Roth IRAs also follow distinct rules depending on marital status. A person who inherits a Roth IRA from their spouse has the option to treat the account as their own, which eliminates RMD requirements during their lifetime. This approach allows for continued tax-free growth of the assets.If the Roth IRA is kept as an inherited account, then the first RMD must be taken by December 31 of the year after the original owners death based on the Single Life Expectancy Table. The same example used previously applies  a 70-year-old inheriting an $80,000 Roth IRA would calculate their RMD using a life expectancy factor of 17.2, resulting in a tax-free distribution of approximately $4,651 in the first year.For non-married partners, the 10-year rule applies to Roth IRAs as well. Since Roth distributions are tax-free, the primary consideration is timing withdrawals to align with financial goals, not tax optimization. A non-married beneficiary might decide to withdraw $8,000 annually for 10 years or allow the assets to grow tax-free for nine years and withdraw the full balance in the 10th year. Again, it all depends on your income needs.(And if you need additional help figuring the best strategy for withdrawing money from an inherited account, speak with a financial advisor.)As alluded to, you should weigh several factors when inheriting traditional IRAs, 401(k)s and Roth IRAs. First and most obviously, marital status plays a significant role in flexibility.Second, traditional IRAs inherited by spouses present a choice between treating it as your own or keeping it as an inherited account. Treating the account as your own allows RMDs to follow the Uniform Lifetime Table, providing a more gradual distribution schedule and potentially reducing the annual tax impact. Alternatively, keeping it as an inherited IRA requires using the Single Life Expectancy Table, which often results in higher RMD amounts each year. The key tradeoff in the decision is distribution amount and taxes.For the Roth IRAs inherited by spouses, treating them as your own would eliminate RMDs entirely. This is typically the most advantageous option for preserving the tax-free growth of the assets. However, if the accounts are kept as inherited Roth IRAs, RMDs must be taken based on the Single Life Expectancy Table, even though these distributions are tax-free.The tax implications of each choice are a major consideration. Traditional IRA distributions are taxed as ordinary income, and managing the timing of these withdrawals is essential for minimizing the tax burden. While Roth IRA distributions are tax-free, required withdrawals could influence your overall strategy by altering the timing and magnitude of any other income streams you maintain.(Tax planning can be complicated, which is why it can help to have a fiduciary financial advisor guide you through tax-related questions.)Given the complexities of RMD rules, beneficiaries like yourself should take a strategic approach to manage inherited accounts.First, evaluate the options for each type of account. For the traditional IRA, decide whether to treat it as your own or keep it as an inherited account based on your current and future income needs, tax situation and financial goals. For the Roth IRAs, treating them as your own if you and your partner were married is generally recommended to avoid RMDs and simplify account management.Second, plan for RMDs by understanding the applicable deadlines and calculations. For example, inherited IRAs require the first RMD to be taken by December 31st of the year following the original account holders death, while the 10-year rule for non-spousal beneficiaries allows flexibility within a decade but demands a full withdrawal by the end of that period. Staying informed about these timelines is crucial to avoid penalties.Next, integrate the inherited accounts into your broader financial plan. Consider how RMDs will affect your taxable income and explore ways to offset this impact through tax-advantaged strategies such as charitable contributions or Roth conversions. Of course, understand how distributions from these accounts fit into your other income streams, such as your salary, pension, 401(k) and Social Security.Finally, seek professional guidance to navigate these rules effectively. A CPA can help ensure compliance with IRS regulations, while a financial advisor can help integrate these accounts into your financial plan. (And if you need help finding a finance professional, this free tool can connect you with three fiduciary advisors who serve your area.)RMD rules for inherited accounts can be complex. I did not even cover the possibility that you could be inheriting inherited IRAs! That is a subject for another conversation. Given the complexity at play, understanding RMD rules is key to making informed decisions that preserve the value of your inheritance. Whether you are a spouse or non-married beneficiary, careful planning and strategic withdrawals can help you maximize the benefits of inherited assets while minimizing tax liabilities. By understanding your current situation, evaluating your options, planning for RMDs and integrating these accounts into your overall financial plan, you can turn this inheritance into a lasting financial asset.Whether you have your own pre-tax retirement account or inherited one from someone else, consider working with a financial advisor if you need help navigating and planning for RMDs.

By converting a portion of your tax-deferred savings each year, you can reduce or potentially eliminate RMDs, since Roth accounts arent subject to these mandatory withdrawals. However, you will owe income tax on each conversions.Are you a financial advisor looking to invest in your marketing and lead generation efforts?

Live Oak Bank High Yield Savings Account: 4.20% APYLive Oak Banks High Yield Savings Account pays 4.20% APY  more than 10 times the national average. There is no minimum opening deposit requirement for this account. However, you must keep at least $0.01 in your account to continue to earn interest.The amount of interest you can earn with a rate of 4% depends on how much money you deposit. The more money you keep in your account, and the longer you hold it there, the more you stand to earn thanks to compound interest.For example, if you deposited $1,000 into a 4% interest savings account that compounds interest daily and left the money there for one year, you'd earn a total of $40 in interest (assuming you don't make any additional contributions).Let's say you deposited $10,000. At the end of the year, you'd earn $400 in interest. And if you made an additional $100 contribution each month, you'd end up with $421.84 in interest earnings.Finding a savings account that pays 4% on your balance is a great way to give your savings a boost and help it grow over time. However, there are additional steps you can take to get the most value out of your account.Start with a higher principal balance: The more money you deposit initially, the more interest you earn from the start.Contribute regularly: Consider setting up automatic transfers to the savings account. Even small, consistent deposits can make a big difference over time. If you contribute $100 monthly  thats an extra $1,200 per year that earns 4% interest, which compounds to grow even more.Take advantage of compound interest: Make sure the interest on your account compounds at least monthly, if not daily. The more frequently interest is compounded, the more your money will grow.Keep your money in the account: Each time you withdraw funds from your savings account, the principal balance that earns interest decreases, which reduces the overall growth potential. A checking account or money market account may be a better fit for money you need for daily spending or paying bills.Watch out for fees: Look for a savings account with no monthly maintenance fees or other charges that could eat into your interest. Some high-yield accounts have minimum balance requirements to avoid fees or earn the highest advertised rate, so be sure you can meet those minimums  or choose an account with no minimum balance requirement.See our picks for the 10 best high-yield savings accountsSavings accounts that offer 4% are becoming increasingly hard to find. Recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve signal that the economy is moving in the right direction, but they also mean deposit account rates are on the decline.Additional rate cuts could be on the horizon, so it pays to take advantage of an account with a higher rate while it lasts.For those looking to maximize their savings, it might be wise to take advantage of current rates while they remain elevated. If you want to lock in today's higher rates, you may want to consider a certificate of deposit (CD) instead of a high-yield savings account.This embedded content is not available in your region."

        "content": "Many drivers spend years on the road, developing an entrepreneurial mindset while focusing on every dollar they generate for their employers. Eventually, the thought crosses their minds: Im making them a lot of money. I need my own truck. I need to make that money for myself. However, few fully grasp the complexities of owning a fleet and the capital required to sustain it.Becoming an owner-operator or running a small fleet requires more than just knowing how to drive. The key to survival, and eventual success, lies in mastering business management. While finding loads and keeping trucks moving is essential, the true metric of long-term stability is cash flow management.Mismanaging finances or failing to anticipate expenses can quickly grind operations to a halt, no matter how many miles you run. The ability to plan for the worst of times and bad markets, make strategic financial decisions, and control costs sets those who struggle from those who thrive in the industry.Understanding Cash FlowCash flow management begins with knowing exactly what is coming in and what is going out. This goes beyond looking at gross revenue; it requires accounting for fuel, maintenance, insurance, loan payments and the inevitable delays in customer payments. Some companies, like Anheuser-Busch, operate on payment terms as long as 180 days. Trucking is a high-cost, cash-flow-intensive business with razor-thin margins, and without careful oversight, even a profitable operation can face financial meltdown.Many new owner-operators get caught up in the excitement of independence without recognizing that being their own boss also means ensuring that there is enough money at the end of each month to keep operations running.The Cost of Starting a Trucking BusinessOne of the first major hurdles for new trucking businesses is the high initial cost of getting started. Whether purchasing a new or used truck, the upfront investment is significant. Leasing, while often perceived as a lower-cost option, still requires sizable down payments, deposits and ongoing financial obligations, many of which come due before ever receiving the first payment for loads run.Once the truck is on the road, expenses add up quickly. Fuel alone can consume nearly half of revenue, and its constantly fluctuating price makes it an unpredictable cost. Maintenance and repairs are another major drain on cash flow. A single breakdown, such as a blown turbo or transmission failure, can cost thousands and take the truck off the road, eliminating revenue while expenses continue to mount. Without a financial reserve, such unexpected repairs can cripple a business.Slow Payments and Cash Flow StrugglesSlow payments from brokers and shippers present another challenge. Unlike a traditional company driver job with biweekly paychecks, trucking businesses often wait 30, 60, or even 90 days for payment. This delay can create cash shortages, making it difficult to cover immediate expenses such as fuel and truck payments.To bridge the gap, some owner-operators turn to factoring companies, which provide immediate cash in exchange for a percentage of the invoice. While this can help maintain cash flow, it also reduces already slim profit margins. Business credit and lines of credit can be helpful financial tools when used strategically but can also lead to long-term financial strain if over-relied on. Generally, if a truck cannot be purchased or financed upfront, it is likely to be just as difficult, if not more so, to keep it running over time.Developing Strong Financial HabitsEstablishing good financial habits early on is huge for protecting cash flow. Maintaining sufficient capital and creating a strict budget is non-negotiable. Fixed costs such as truck payments, insurance and permits must be accounted for alongside variable costs like fuel and maintenance. Investing in an accounting system or hiring a bookkeeper can provide real-time insight into financial health and prevent costly surprises.Billing customers immediately and following up on unpaid invoices can also prevent cash shortages. Many successful fleet owners equip their trucks with mobile scanning apps to ensure that proof of delivery documents are submitted immediately after deliveries, allowing for faster invoicing.Cutting Unnecessary ExpensesAnother crucial strategy for maintaining cash flow is minimizing unnecessary expenses. While upgrading equipment, adding chrome, or investing in luxury features may be tempting, every dollar spent must be justified by its impact on the business. Many successful owner-operators adopt a simple rule: If it doesnt make money, it can wait.Fuel is one of the most significant expenses in trucking, and using fuel cards that offer discounts and spending analysis can help reduce costs. Proper tire inflation, sticking to preventive maintenance schedules and optimizing routes can also improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary expenses.Load selection also plays a critical role in profitability. Avoiding low-paying freight and minimizing deadhead miles can mean the difference between a profitable week and a financial setback. Choosing freight wisely and refusing to haul loads that cost more to transport than they pay can prevent wallet strain.Preparing for Seasonal FluctuationsFreight markets fluctuate, and failing to prepare for slow seasons can lead to financial difficulties. Some lanes, industries, or modes experience peak seasons where freight rates surge, followed by periods of depression. Many trucking businesses make the mistake of overspending during high-revenue months without setting aside a financial cushion for the inevitable slow periods.Saving money for the business is just as important as saving for personal finances. A strong financial reserve can mean the difference between weathering a downturn and being forced out of business.Financial ToolsFinancial tools such as factoring, business loans and lines of credit can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on how they are used and which vendor partner you choose. Factoring provides immediate cash but erodes profits over time. Business loans can provide necessary funding but require strong credit and often collateral. Lines of credit offer flexibility but should be used strategically.Refinancing existing loans as interest rates improve can help improve cash flow by reducing monthly payments, but every financing decision should be made with long-term stability in mind. The trucking business is a long game, success requires strategic thinking rather than quick fixes.The Power of Strong Cash FlowMaintaining a strong cash flow improves profit margins and provides growth opportunities. With readily available cash, owner-operators and small fleet owners can negotiate better terms with suppliers, access volume discounts and seize opportunities when they arise. Additionally, financial stability reduces stress, allowing for better decision-making and long-term planning. You need the breather room.Trucking is a business. It is not just driving. Like any business, those who fail to manage their finances properly do not survive. The independence of being an owner-operator or fleet owner comes with significant responsibility and cash flow management is one of the most critical factors for success. Staying disciplined, making smart financial decisions and preparing for the unexpected are essential for maintaining profitability and long-term stability.The post Managing Cash to Keep the Wheels Turning appeared first on FreightWaves."

        "content": "New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose more than forecast in January as core prices reversed last month's easing with the Federal Reserve's path forward in focus.The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December's 2.9% annual gain in prices.The index rose 0.5% over the previous month, the largest monthly headline increase since August 2023 and a slight acceleration from the 0.4% rise seen in December. Economists had expected a 0.3% increase.Seasonal factors like higher fuel costs and continued stickiness in food inflation kept the headline figures elevated. Notably, the index for eggs increased 15.2%, the largest increase since June 2015. It accounted for about two-thirds of the total monthly food-at-home increase, according to the BLS. Year over year, egg prices have surged 53%.Read more: From $5 eggs to insurance premiums, here's where prices are risingOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in January climbed 0.4% over the prior month, higher than December's 0.2% monthly gain and the largest monthly rise since April 2023.Core prices rose 3.3% over last year, marking an uptick from the 3.2% seen in December, which was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI showed a deceleration in price growth.Core inflation has remained stubbornly elevated due to sticky costs for shelter and services like insurance and medical care. Shelter did show some signs of easing last month, rising 4.4% on an annual basis, the smallest 12-month increase in three years. Similarly, the year-over-year increase in rent was the coolest since February 2022.It was a different story for used-car prices, which saw another strong uptick for the fourth consecutive month. The index rose 2.2% in January after a 1.2% increase in December and a 2% monthly gain in November.Used cars likely contributed to the overall increase in core goods, which hit its highest level since May 2023.Although inflation has been slowing, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis, with economists and Fed officials pointing to a \"bumpy\" road ahead.\"There's no sugarcoating this. This is not a good print,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Federal Reserve economist, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program.\"The one thing to say is this is a familiar disappointment,\" she continued, noting the start of a new year has previously contributed to upside surprises. \"Having a hot print in January in recent years has been a common occurrence. It's also been a common occurrence that's dissipated as the year has gone on. So this isn't a deal breaker for the year as a whole, but it is certainly not a good way to start things off.\"Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, agreed, adding that \"seasonality and one-off factors may have played some role in the upside surprise.\"However, \"the combination of average earnings growth surprising to the upside last week, the supercore services inflation number moving sharply higher today, and the government's policy agenda threatening to raise inflation expectations is almost too convincing to dismiss,\" she said.The ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency has further muddied the inflation outlook, with economists arguing the US could face another inflation resurgence as Trump commits to a protectionist trade policy. That's likely to complicate the central bank's path forward for interest rates.Read more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investmentsOn Monday, President Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will take effect on March 12. Tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada are set to come next month, while 10% duties on China have already been implemented.Shortly after the release, traders scaled back expectations of a Fed rate cut, pricing in just one cut from the central bank this year. Stocks also sold off in the immediate aftermath of the results before somewhat recovering by mid-afternoon trade.\"The Fed is never going to overreact to one month of data,\" Sahm said. \"They've been telling us since December that they are in no hurry to adjust rates again, and that will be reinforced today.\"\"We're back in the case of last year where we're going to have to see months and months  getting out of the first quarter  of better inflation data before the Fed gets comfortable with it. So it really does push the timeline probably into the second half of the year [if] this ends up being the outlier.\"Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Its common for even very high earners to feel squeezed, especially if you live in an expensive area like New York, San Francisco or Boston. Costs of living close to your job will almost certainly be high, particularly since youre competing with other six-figure earners. Depending on your field, you could easily have $200,000 or more in student loans. And the long hours demanded by many lucrative jobs can lead to a surprising amount of stress. Oftentimes, one spouse will take care of the household and children to balance out the family economics.This dynamic may require special considerations for long-term planning. If youre looking ahead and your retirement savings arent what youd like them to be, there are strategies you can take to accelerate your savings and get ahead. For advice on your personal situation, talk to a financial advisor today.The more time you have to save and invest, the better off you are.For example, say youre 45. In that case you might not have a problem to solve. Take your $600,000 starting point, work until age 70 and keep on making standard 10% contributions to an S&P 500 fund. At that rate you could retire with about $10.4 million in the bank, giving you $416,000 per year at a 4% withdrawal rate.On the other hand, say that youre 60. With 10 years to save, that same scheme may generate about $2.2 million in savings. At a 4% withdrawal rate this would generate $88,000 per year, enough for some people to live comfortably but you will likely feel squeezed based on your income during your working years.So your plan here will depend almost entirely on how old you are.If possible, retire later so your investments have time to grow. And adjust your approach based on your age. The younger you are, the more you can compensate for an underfunded portfolio with aggressive investment strategies. Your portfolio has time to grow and to recover from market downturns.The older you are, the less time your portfolio has to grow and recover from downturns. Instead, you can compensate with the more secure option of aggressive budgeting and increased savings. If youre unsure of the best strategy to maximize your retirement savings, talk to a financial advisor about your situation.Dont forget that your spouse gets annual retirement contributions, even though they dont work. If you havent already, have your spouse open an IRA (ideally a Roth IRA) and maximize their annual contributions. While IRAs usually require an individual to contribute their own earned income, a spousal IRA allows the working spouse to make contributions on behalf of the non-working spouse.The limits on an IRA are relatively low, but still useful. For example, in 2025, you can put up to $7,000 per year in an IRA. Generating a 7% return for about 20 years, you may save over $300,000 this way.For that matter, dont forget to contribute to your own IRA. Given your income its likely that you have a workplace 401(k), which is good, but you can also invest in an IRA on the side.A financial advisor can help you determine appropriate portfolio allocations.A lot of spending power also means that you have a lot of saving power if youre willing to budget.So take the following steps:First, figure out the costs of a lifestyle you would enjoy. You also likely have things you can scale back, but not cut. For example, keep traveling, but fly coach. Set the budget for a nice lifestyle, but not a lavish one. Youll also want to build in some room for the unexpected. A financial advisor can help you project a realistic retirement budget. Ultimately, youll want to synchronize this budget with a reasonable projection of your retirement income.For example, using the 4% rule, if you want to live on $150,000 per year you will need a $3.75 million portfolio by retirement. You currently make about $300,000 after taxes (roughly, based on your state). Even if you have 10 years until retirement, if you set your budget to $150,000 now and contribute the other $150,000 to your savings, you could have $3.9 million by retirement. You will have a comfortable income now, and secure that income for years to come.High-income, high-spending lifestyles are more common than youd think, but it can lead to a crisis when you want to retire. The good news is that you have a lot of saving power, but depending on your age it might mean significantly rethinking your budget and lifestyle today so that you can live comfortably in the future.With this kind of money, its useful to start thinking of your finances in terms of wealth rather than income. Wealth management is the practice of letting money build money, and looking at those assets in the long term. It could be very helpful for someone with significant earnings. A financial advisor can help you build a comprehensive retirement plan. Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard. SmartAssets free tool matches you with vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can have a free introductory call with your advisor matches to decide which one you feel is right for you. If youre ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid -- in an account that isn't at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

        "content": "Money market accounts (MMAs) can be a great place to store your cash if you're looking for a relatively high interest rate along with liquidity and flexibility.Unlike traditional savings accounts, MMAs typically offer better returns, and they may also provide check-writing privileges and debit card access. This makes these accounts ideal for holding long-term savings that you want to grow over time, but can still access when needed for certain purchases or bills.Even though rates have been falling over the past several months, it's still possible to find money market accounts that pay more than 4% APY.Here is a look at some of today's best money market account rates:Interested in earning the best possible interest rate on your savings balance? Here is a look at some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.This embedded content is not available in your region.Money market account rates have fluctuated significantly in recent years, largely due to changes in the Federal Reserve's target interest rate.In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, for example, interest rates were kept extremely low to stimulate the economy. The Fed slashed the federal funds rate to near zero, which led to very low MMA rates. During this time, money market account rates were typically around 0.10% to 0.50%, with many accounts offering rates on the lower end of that range.Eventually, the Fed began raising interest rates gradually as the economy improved. This led to higher yields on savings products, including MMAs. However, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a brief but sharp recession, and the Fed once again cut its benchmark rate to near zero to combat the economic fallout. This resulted in a sharp decline in MMA rates.But starting in 2022, the Fed embarked on a series of aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation. This led to historically high deposit rates across the board. By late 2023, money market account rates had risen substantially, with many accounts offering 4.00% or higher. However, the Fed finally began cutting rates in late 2024.As of 2025, MMA rates remain high by historical standards, though they've begun a downward trajectory following the Fed's most recent rate cuts. Today, online banks and credit unions tend to offer the highest rates.When comparing money market accounts, it's important to look beyond just the interest rate. Other factors, such as minimum balance requirements, fees, and withdrawal limits, can impact the total value you get from the account.For example, it's common for money market accounts to require a large minimum balance in order to earn the highest advertised rate  as much as $5,000 or more in some cases. Other accounts may charge monthly maintenance fees that can eat into your interest earnings.However, there are several MMAs available that offer competitive rates without any balance requirements, fees, or other restrictions. That's why it's important to shop around and compare accounts before making a decision.Additionally, ensure that the account you choose is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which guarantees deposits up to $250,000 per institution, per depositor. Most money market accounts are federally insured, but it's important to double-check in the rare case the financial insitution fails.Read more: Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Which is best for you?The national average interest rate for money market accounts is just 0.64%, according to the FDIC. However, the best money market account rates often pay around 4% to 4.75% APY  similar to the rates offered on high-yield savings accounts.The amount you will earn on $50,000 in a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY) and the time period you leave the money in the account. For example, if you deposit $50,000 into a money market account that pays 4.5% APY and left it in your account for one year, you'd earn $2,303 in interest.There are currently no money market accounts that pay 5% APY. However, some high-yield savings accounts from online banks do. You can also check with your local bank or credit union to find out if they offer a 5% APY account that fits your needs.This embedded content is not available in your region."

Heres the reality: while converting to a Roth IRA ramps up your taxable income for that year, it doesnt affect the way Social Security calculates your benefits. Social Security relies solely on your earned income - not the extra taxable income generated by a Roth conversion. So even though youll pay taxes on the conversion, it wont add any extra credits to your Social Security record. In fact, Roth conversions can add costs in other retirement areas, as well, despite their advantages.Here are some more things to consider for your retirement planning. You can also use this free tool to match with a financial advisor if youre interested in professional guidance for retirement planning and more.A Roth conversion is when you move money from a pre-tax portfolio, like a 401(k) or an IRA, and put it into a Roth IRA. You can only move money from a pre-tax portfolio, not a depository account or a taxed investment account. However, within this restriction, there is no limit to how much money you can convert in a given year.The advantage to a Roth conversion is that you will receive the full benefits of a Roth IRA. This means your money will grow tax-free and, when you withdraw it, you won't pay any taxes on those withdrawals. A Roth account is also exempt from RMD rules, and qualified withdrawals do not count toward your taxable income in a given year.The disadvantage to a Roth conversion is that the entire amount converted counts toward your taxable income for the year. For example, say you earned $75,000 in salary and converted $100,000 to your Roth IRA in the same calendar year. Your total taxable income for that year would be $175,000.For any Roth conversion, you need to make sure you have the cash on hand to pay the additional income taxes that this conversion will trigger. If you're over 59.5 years old, you can take the money from your retirement fund. Otherwise, you need the cash on hand from other sources.This will also affect any other programs that measure your taxable income. For example, your Social Security benefit taxes and Medicare premiums might increase, since both are based on your taxable income. This also could affect some student aid programs, if you have a child in school or are in school yourself, or it might change your eligibility for Medicaid.In this case, if you convert $50,000 per year you should plan for these fluctuations. A $50,000 increase in your taxable income will significantly increase your income taxes for the year, and will almost certainly affect any income-assessed programs. Unless you are already at the top of the range, for example, your Medicare premiums will definitely go up, and your Social Security benefit taxes too. Make sure you plan for that.Any income-related fluctuations will be temporary, since conversion taxes only apply to the year in which you made the conversion. In our case above, for example, the following year your income would be $75,000 again. However it's important to prepare for the full impact of spiking your taxable income, even if just temporarily.A financial advisor can help you navigate taxes and execute an appropriate strategy.Social Security benefits are based on a credit system. During your working life, you receive credits from the Social Security Agency for all income earned each year. The SSA tracks these on an annual basis. That is, you receive credits for all earned income in 2024, then a separate set of credits for all earned income in 2025, and so on.You receive credits up to the maximum earnings that are eligible for Social Security taxes. Any income above this level does not generate additional credits. In 2025, this maximum is $176,100.Your Social Security benefits in retirement are based on these credits earned during your working life. When you retire, the Social Security Agency averages the credits you earned during your 35 highest-earning years. Your benefits are then calculated based on this average.As noted above, there is a critical difference between the income associated with Roth conversions and Social Security credits.Roth conversions increase your taxable income for a given year. This is defined as the amount of income potentially eligible for federal, state and local taxes, regardless of the source. Note that it doesn't necessarily mean that amount of income on which you do pay taxes, given deductions, exclusions and other exemptions. It's just the amount which could be eligible for taxation.Earned income, on the other hand, is money that you receive for work. There are a few statutory examples of earned income as well, for example strike benefits or disability pay. In general, this means money received as payment for a job, earnings from self-employment, and profits from running a business. Most significantly, it does not include money you receive from investments or other portfolios.Earned income is, in almost all cases, taxable income. However, not all taxable income is earned income. This is where the distinction comes in here. A Roth conversion uses money taken from an investment portfolio. Although it applies to your taxable income for the year, it is not considered earned income. As a result, a Roth conversion will not affect your potential Social Security benefits, no matter how much money you move.Consider speaking with a financial advisor about your financial goals.Roth conversions cannot increase your Social Security benefits. A Roth conversion increases your taxable income, while Social Security credits are assessed based on your earned income. While Roth conversions can increase the taxes you pay on benefits if you make a conversion in retirement, they cannot increase your benefits themselves.Just because a Roth conversion can't increase your Social Security benefits, that doesn't mean it can't be done. In fact, here are four tips on how you can plan to boost your benefits in retirement. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

An emergency fund should be liquid  in an account that isnt at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. Compare savings accounts from these banks.Are you a financial advisor looking to grow your business?

Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!\" he posted.In a separate post he also said, \"Biden inflation up!\"Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee Ranking member, Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, told Powell Tuesday that she wanted to see rates be reduced at the Feds next meeting in March.\"I urge you to move more rapidly to bring down interest rates beginning with a meaningful rate cut next month,\" Warren told Powell.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration is looking to lower long-term borrowing costs via the 10-year Treasury yield, not through targeting the Feds short-term benchmark interest rate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is moving higher on the hotter inflation report.There was hope among Fed officials that given hotter inflation readings in the first quarter of 2024, that comparisons would become easier this first quarter. However, Januarys reading showed hotter inflation even before any impact of tariffs.Sahm told Yahoo Finance the Fed is back to where it was at the start of 2024, needing several months of good data before it can think about lowering rates again.\"It is not a good way to start things off\" in 2025.Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth said he thinks that prediuctions of 1 cut in 2025 are \"too dovish.\"\"With tariffs likely to keep core PCE inflation close to, or above, 3% this year now, the Fed will stand pat for at least the next 12 months.\"Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock pricesRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
