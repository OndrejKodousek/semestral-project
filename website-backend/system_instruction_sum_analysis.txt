### Instructions:
1. **Stock and Ticker**: Identify the full company name and ticker symbol from the articles.
2. **Summary**: Summarize the key points from all articles. Highlight trends, conflicting opinions, and overall sentiment.
3. **Predictions**: Provide percentage change predictions for the next 12 days. Use decimal format (e.g., '0.05987' for +5.987% or '-0.02563' for -2.563%).
4. **Confidence Levels**: Assign confidence levels for each prediction, ranging from 0.0 (no confidence) to 1.0 (full confidence). Use decimal format (e.g., '0.7587' for 75.87%).
5. **Reasoning**: Ensure the predictions and confidence levels are based on the analysis of the articles and their reasoning.
